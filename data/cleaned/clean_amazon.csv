4,the cable is efficient in fast charging but in quick data transfer overall finei like the usb c l shape nylon shielded core wire it improves the life of the cablei think i buy these every months or so fast charging stops working after a while probbly something to do with the cable design the cable gets twisted over time and i suspect that breaks the high capacity wires inside but i keep buying it because there arent too many options in an l shaped designgood and durable product sometime the charges doesnt work on few adapters there might be few cut off or something but works fine on apple adapter car charger usbthe product is really good at affordable pricegood and fast charging and value for moneyபரள உடய கடனததனமயன நனறக உளளத சரஜ ஏறம வகம watnot a fast charger very slow charging with w lshape pin is very useful
4,i am using it for days now the experience is pretty good as of now picture quality is also not bad dont expect something out of the world at this price point but you can go for it if you have a tight budgetinitial impressions works as said glad i didnt go for cheaper options not that its too costly just plug and play will update if it screws upthe hdmi cable is good to watch moviesports and its gives better quality while connecting your laptop with tv and play i loved itworks as expected length of the cable is short and it was mentioned also satisfied my requirement if you need more length better look other optionsall goodits the best hdmi cable at this price range no problems yet just go for it i was expecting this to be delivered on time and it was delivered on timeproduct is good as i have tried other cables and wires from amazon basica brandgood one

4,about the tv wonderfulprobably the best tv in this price range inrgood google interface loaded with features lightweight watt power consumption stable designaverage sound and picture quality is quite good but if you compare it with premium brands then obviously not that goodfeatures most of the streaming apps available and compatible you can connect with wifi lan cable hdmi set top box laptop usb gaming console old dish cable and direct tv antenna as well built in chromecast to cast any compatible app directly from phone to tv over same wifi networkways to connect phone via cast feature on mobile apps no password needed only need to be on the same wifi network via chromecast app project only selected media pics videos or entire phone screenways to connect pclaptop windows cast option project the entire laptop screen on tv using windows cast option need to be connected on same wifi network via hdmi cableabout the amazon installation service awful the technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had mrp inr on it and asked for inr for it without any receipt he kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially however it clearly had mrp mentioned on it i went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just inr and for installation of that as well technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top he just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws which i had bought with him after about half an hour of arguments he finally drilled the other required holes and for all this he kept cussing me that i wasted his time there was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as wellthis whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments this was the worst installation experience in my life so farbottomline please do not avail the so called free installation service from amazon it is just a scam instead call the acer support they will do the job much betterafter using it for months here are its pros and conspros great picture quality its awesome blacks are very good and is adjustable sound with db is very good looks great with thin besel remote comes with favorite ott buttons content upscaling is very goodcons remote could have been better cant use dth remote to turn on both televisison and set top box remote operation is bit complex motion technology not great there is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson ott but it decreases when you switch to dthoverall its a nice buy at this price point i think i am getting fairly better picture quality and sound i am satisfied with the productproduct has good picture quality good product at that price with w sound applications running smoothly months older no issues yet its running smoothlyyou get decent features for the price you pay screen resolution might be set back as you may find pixalation overall its goodi am amazed with the picture quality of this p hd ready tv it is truly an amazing panel i found it suitable for a viewing distance of between to feet any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther it will feel like a very small size the speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions however since the speaker is downward firing the experience will vary based on whether the tv is wall mounted or kept on a standthe remote is good voice search works well for me tv start up takes a long time in my opinion but i have not compared it against any other inch tv and hence do not know where it stands among peers ghz wifi works very well even across walls only negative aspect i faced is wrt the experience of using my bluetooth headphonesearphones firstly the connection sometimes doesnt happen automatically after a restart which means i have to remove and rediscover the device thru the menu which is not simple secondly the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of feet in front of the tv the signal breaks even if you move your head by incheshowever i am still super happy with this tv i got it for k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my sideat this price rangeit is good quality product on this marketacer only should work with sound quality improvement otherwise all okpicture quality really impressivewifi connectivity goodeasy to installboderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is goodsometimes laggingno major issues found on this tvjust go for itvellu for money good productvery nice productsave money
4,the signal is too unstable once connect you need a bit of adjustment by unplugging or moving the wire to get a proper signal but does the job go for this if you want to experiment with hdmi as i wasnt sure it would work for me or not otherwise go for a good quality breaded cablegood productthe cable did not come in a box there is no box if this was to be shipped without any packaging or branding same should have been mentioned when we pay for hi quality products we expect a certain quality i still have no idea if this is a hi speed k cable or notgoodbought to connect my cp monitor cctv to mi android tv ok quality at this pricei give it a on reasons as below amazon delivery super fast same day delivery within hours the delivery person was good robust built quality looks feels premium it is working excellent im using for lapptop to big screen tv connectivity and could see the undistorted picture and sound nicely doing its worka few words of cons feels a little hard to adjust and bend as per requirement less flexible but this may not be a serious concernoverall a nice experience so fargood joblike
4,this oneplus tv is great if you want a affordable and middle range features tv i got it in the offer and it was totally worth itpros sound is awesome satisfied with the quality of sound dolby audio w speakers are really great for sure affordable tv size and slim it is slim and looks stylish very light weight and handy to install easy to install and mount to wall tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home it gets integrated with mobile apps remote wifi networks very quickly and easily the overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic it supports all the smart features like netflix prime and youtube it is easily installable and signin to start using quickly it is also easy to scan the setup box channels and start viewing themcons picture quality is p its average and not very clear but it is worth the price range ill not complaint as the cost of tv is very affordable and this quality is justified bluetooth and wifi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues i encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up againrest all is very good and loved this product i feel it was worth ordering if you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and dont have extensive smart use then go for thisif you want to use a lot of smart features and ott platforms and watch movies and sports then go for better version with full hd and k quality this tv will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but its very good for daily family shows and tv channelsone last thing i want to express and im ver disappointed about is thisi got my order delivered on friday and i scheduled my installation for saturday but nobody turned up that day and i had to reschedule it for tuesday morning and even today nobody turned up i got a call from amazon to reschedule it for tuesday evening and still nobody turned upthis is very very bad and irresponsible service by oneplus and amazon im very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior a company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing thiswhat do you guys expect us to do wait for to days to get my tv installed even when its been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days even when im having my smart tv delivered to my home i have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properlyat least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company you should take care that the money i spent has been worth it and not facing any issues highly disappointed with this behavior and servicegood productconnectivity is fasterbut performance is little bit slowerthe biggest problem i face is it dont have a aux cable so im not able to connect my sound barthe hdmi port is useless it wont work soi connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it wont connect automatically everytime i on the tv i need to connect it manually its a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now its been months and its super laggy even after the update its just the sameyeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstandingthats allgood quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice budget friendly im happy with this after a few days the tv will perform slowly and the remote is very very sentencethank you amazon and oneplus sound is good easy installation very slim and less weight voice recognition is goodlikebudgetfriendlydislikewifi connectivity range is poormany times gets disconnectedcolor depth not that good
4,the product seems and works good but its not a fast charging cable as it has to be and when all the three ports are connected its more slower im charging only good is single cable all three ports are there so its a ok product only if yiu are looking for fast charging then i would say think twice before you buyi have been using foe a while now this is for sure not a fast charging cable and in this tge lightning charger is not working properly every now and then i have to check its it charging my iphone and i had to unplug and reply for charging its getting disconnected i dont understand how so this cable is no oki used this type c most commonly depending on my devices power wats and also etcnice chargercharging is bit slow when u connect multiple devicescannot transfer dataonly charging purposeso nice colour cheap and bestthe cable looks decent with charging but not fit for me as it does not support apple car play

4,good budget mfi certified lightly cable for this price update usage review after to months better than the original one in matter of robustness and durability better in prospect of charging it is far better in durability from the original apple wire do not think more you can buy blindly worth to buy and it is mfi certified so you ios device not damaged but small negative point is packaging quality of the productthe charger is a great carry on accessory while travelling without risking the original chargerprice is also very affordable and charging speed is very good with good adaptor or power bankgood product can recommend all only thing i see as issue is the material the cable threads peels off when stick to a velcro materials other wise good product charges very well like originalnicereliable and worth itthe cable shipped in box made by apple felt less sturdy and reliable after using one or two times and felt it would break more quickly at the lighting port and had to order amazon basics cable which is miles better and apple mifi certified
4,it does the job really well no complaints regarding the charging power at a price of rs it is worth every buck although this cable is a bit shorter than the original one but the original oneplus cable is around rs so there is a huge price difference and it does the same job as the original oneuseful for c type charging but not suitable with all adapters or usb points serves the purposesturdily built does its job well charged my samsung galaxy m quicker than the original cable hope it stays the same going aheadliked the charging speed disliked the length on ipads this is awesome but its is not foot long so this the only point to think otherwise it is the best cablegoodeverything is good including connectivity and stuffnice productim using this for my carthis product is nice and worth the amounti recommend it to anyone who are looking for this kind of cable
4,i am posting this after a few weeks of using the productusage continuous ott only no cabledish operatoraverage daily usage hoursthe tv is a great valueformoney productinstallation the installation was simple and amazon assisted installation was smooth timely and hasslefreepicture the picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a sony lg and samsung with these kind of specs movies and especially hires tv series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times the output while in hires wouldnt look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of sony samsung lg etc however with time you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone elses better tvsound sound output is decent you wouldnt need additional support to enhance the volume as suchremote sleek sensitive and userfriendly its exactly like amazons remoteos same as any smart android tv works smoothly without much lags or hiccups switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than sony but unless you have used to of those performances it looks just finestandalone and as your first smart tv you wouldnt find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hires from the beginning it is a great value for money product without a doubthowever if you are considering this as an alternative or second tv after owning the better ones in the past you will have a hard time adjusting with itpicture quality is good for this price didnt faced any lag on ui and browsing other apps only negative will be audio definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher overall worth for money u spend but the installation process is just awful amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money no demo given on tv as they have no idea about the product these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through onlinescreen looks amazing but problem is with processor i believe if k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickersnot so often but problem exists even remote control is not good as it take at least sec to react for the user actionreason why i believe processor is bad because i do k gaming using ps and never encountered problem with the screenif you buy tv in a small town shop it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours when you want to buy a tv from amazon you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable the problem is with the installation they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product its like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you cant eat so i ordered my tv on monday it got delivered on friday and it will be installed on monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns if we had the technician details we could reach out s get it installed but that also will be shared hours beforeregarding product its good quality and very good for a average user heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging i guessthis tv gives good results within the budget should definitely buy if the budget is k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part the installation guy didnt arrive at very first day that was scheduled even after rescheduling he didnt came for installation purpose so strictly be aware of this point the tv i got in offer with k discount on icici card but although the product came out defective it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece i didnt got the replacement for the product and its totally unfair deal by amazon and the seller toofinal verdict is the tv quality and feature are good but the service from seller and amazon that is got was very poor inspite i was prime member the seller dawntech electronics private limited gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases amazon will not help you thankyouteamalso to be added tv installation services with product while delivering and unboxing no need to other subvendor to getting installation and demo also dependency on thirdparty involvement should be lessbad experience with tv installation stuffpls look into this picture quality good sound quality not upto my xpectations not able to find the real dolby stereo effect remote not upto the mark for picture quality for both sound and remote qualitygood quality picture but it hangs on home screen

if you didnt choose installation then just shoot the video of unboxing by yourself to avoid any hassle in case replacement is needed amazon prime and netflix are not inbuilt but can be sideloaded to use your set top box with android interface you need to buy mi ir cable and set it up or else directly connect the set up box via av or hdmi port to use it conventionally out of gb memory you only get around gb free to use check the image attachedthere are hundreds of review on this tv here as well as on youtube but none explains the tvs potential completely and what its actual flaws are heres a quick fact for the users complaining about the less cost to benefits ratio guys if you buy a android tv box alone which has processing capacity similar to this tv then it would alone cost you more than k rupees here you get this tv with that android setup with various other feature under k so just check once what options you have before complainingeventually i bought this tv since i was already using a version for months and wanted smaller version for bedroom now after using this tv for over weeks i am stating my detailed user experience its a detailed huge review but do read it if you want to invest this much amount if you want to get quick overview of the device then read below else scroll down for detailed review firstly its budget friendly only smart tv under k in the current market has most number of output port av hdmi usb has android out of the box along with inbuilt bluetooth has dual interface mi patchwall android tv i mostly prefer android tv interface remote has bluetooth voice search with sleek profile has better processor compared to predecessor along with gb ram gb storage gb actual speaker output is low need ir cable for using set top box with android interface amazon prime netflix is not preloaded but can be side loaded native display is only hd though p even k videos from youtube works well check images attached can install play tons of high quality games like rr etc check images attached finally smartphone mirroring works fine most of the timefull detailed review built quality has combination of plastic and aluminium for the main body its not great but above average table top stands looks bit flimsy but are workable the screws which are provided in the box does not fits the tv perfectly so i bought new from local store it has averagely slim profile not the slimmest in the market speaker placement is inconvenient since they are placed at the bottom so when you keep it on table top the sound tends to dampen and bulge has good ventilation for electronics and it hardly heats up overall built quality is above averagedisplay quality it has very thin bezels which looks great video resolution is xp but p videos works fine on it k videos on youtube runs smoothly as well viewing angle are good compared to price check the images attached contrast is above average brightness is good and colours are quite vivid display quality is also above average not very greatremote control its very sleek and compact has only buttons and is easy to operate fortunately it has volume buttons which is handy i have couple of android tv boxes without volume button on remote so i know the pain of using mouse to adjust the volume p placement of voice search button is improper its just below power button and i end up pressing power button a lot finally its bluetooth so no need to point it towards tv for operationother features it has dual interface ie patchwall and android tv has tons of content many games can be installed till you have memory left including multiplayer games google voice search is very useful if you dont want to use keyboard processing speed is fast and i havent detected any lags yet lags in streaming can be due to slow internet speed not due to hardware bluetooth and wifi connectivity works perfectlycons speaker output though rated w is not upto the mark my w jbl speakers has better and louder sound placement of speaker is inconvenient as in table top position speakers face the table and sound dampens internal memory is very less no netflix and amazon prime pre loaded though you can side load them miracast not supported even normal smartphone mirroring lags sometimes native resolution is just p hd though the p videos works on usb k on youtube screen is slightly reflective its similar to almost all the other led tvs mixed experiences of after sales servicecustomer care firstly the installation is a joke my installation was scheduled days after my product delivery and the fun part is theres only days replacement window for this product p company only takes replacement if the product is opened by their representative so theres no point of return window time frame mi has mixed reviews for repairs and services though i have not encountered any problem with any mi tv yet i have had issues with other mi products and service center near me is always very helpfulverdict considering all the facts if you are fine with above average display quality want a smart tv and if you have tight budget then this the tv you should certainly go for trust me you wont get any better deal than this least for coming couple of months if you have higher budget then certainly explore brands like sony samsung etcthis is not a perfect smart tv but for the given price and years of warranty its no brainer to choose this its certainly worth the investmentthis television is definitely a perfect balance between price and performance especially during flash sale at an exceptional price of performance the processor in this smart tv is powerful enough to play k bit hevc videos right out of the box vlc or mx player can be installed for enhanced media supportpicture quality many people complain about the overbright screen but it can be compensated by adjusting the display settingsthese are my preferred settingsbacklight to during night even the lowest value of is bright enough and can watch content without hurting eyesduring day time adjust it as per your requirement depending on your ambient lighting conditions a maximum of would be enoughsetting backlight to minimum improves black levels reduces power consumption increases led life and reduces eye strain especially during nightbrightness brightness setting controls black levelincreasing brightness reduces black levels and hence reduces contrastbrightness at pictures looks washed out with poor blacks and color saturationat black looks deep but lots of details at dark areas are lost while watching movies is an optimal setting to my eyes with good blacks and not so lack of detailscontrast to contrast setting controls white levelcontrast can be set anywhere between and increasing contrast too much may cause highlight areas in a picture like bright skies or shiny objects might look overexposed as the screen itself is very bright increasing contrast further makes whites look over bright also colors gets washed out while increasing contrastsaturation to color saturation can be set anywhere between to at colors look more natural at colors looks a bit punchy but still its a personal preferenceat the above settings the black levels and colors were pleasing while watching demo videos of oled tvs on youtube at p the following youtube videos help you to check the black level quality of the tvlg k oled beauty of black demolg oled eclipse demolg hd demo art nouveaufull hd and k videos looks sharp in this tv downloaded a sample k hevc video named life untouched and also a k hevc sample of the movie elysium both of them played smoothly on the tv with very good detailsscreen quality i think this is a va panel the quality of which sits right in between tn and ips panels the screen is glossy and hence reflective this might be a problem if the tv is placed in a room with windows facing itlike all other lcd panels this also has also got uneven screen uniformity but thats only noticed in plain dark grey backgrounds while watching movies or other content its not at all a problem screen non uniformity is a common issue even with high end tvs of big brands like lg samsung etcluckily theres no backlight bleeding in the unit i receivedviewing angles are average with some loss of contrast even at low angles but thats a common va panel characteristic ips panels with good viewing angles cant be expected at this price pointall lcd panel technologies have their strengths and weaknesses ips panels have good viewing angles but has poor black levels va panels excels in black depth despite its average viewing angles and this tv has got very impressive black levelssound quality bass is a bit weak i think bass is improved following some updates so giving stars from its very loud even at low volume midrange and treble are very good even minute high pitched click and tick sounds in movies can be heard very clearlyeditin a previous review i have mentioned these eq settings sounds good but it isnthz hz hz hz hz a high value of for hz actually make the sound muddy and muffledthe following settings sounds much better and heres the reason hz bassfrequency setting for deep bass male vocals and instruments like kick drumtoms snare etc hz low midrangeenhances bass and depth of male vocals increasing hz too much makes sounds muddy and muffled reducing clarity of high frequency sounds hz midrangeimparts a metallic tone increasing makes sound tinny and unpleasant hz upper midrangevocals especially female sounds best at this frequency a value of enhances vocal quality increasing too much makes vocals harsh hz trebleadds crispiness and sparkle to vocals and instruments enhances tinkling sounds of metallic instrumentshuman ear is sensitive to midrange and upper midrange frequencies here its and hz setting these values too high can cause listening fatigue even increasing hz is disturbinggreat sound performance especially bass is not even expected from a television in this budget but considering its midrange frequency clear treble and loudness it deserves starsremote control minimalism is great but minimalism with less functionality is not so great addition ofmutetv settings and video input selection buttons would ve made the remote more functionalapp support updatewhen the tv was released there was no support for netflix and amazon prime but now with pie update it supports both netflix and amazon prime now the tv deserves stars for app supportpros and cons pros powerful processor for k media playback app installation via usb built in chromecast bluetooth remote voice commandcons updatepreviously the main issues with the tv were the lack of autoplay function and standby optionbut in the latest update both these issues are solvednow when the tv is turned on it will automatically go to the previous input sourceto enable it go to settngs inputs enable stay on the previous source optionscreen off feature is also added in the new update long pressing power button will show screen off optionthe only disadvantage left on the tv was lack of miracast but on a latest update build pi miracast is included and now its perfectto sum upoverall considering the picture quality powerful hardware and the price the tv definitely deserve stars devoid of its average audio quality and the glossy screen because there are no other tvs in market with such features at this price point also xiaomi now has got very strong service support across indianew brands like iffalcon blaupunkt thomson etc might provide better options at a competitive price but when it comes to service centres its a dead endi am very much satisfied with the purchaseits good productgoodif you like a best tv on your budget ill recommend you this stunning picture quality and dts surround is osm but there was a few lagging problem and miracast is not good build quality goodsound and bass excellentproduct is very good sound quality is crisp worth buying i brought it years back still working finegood quality
4,easy to useits good and usefulhad been using this for quite sometime supports dual bands signal coverage is yet like others good use easy to install and useexcellent product revived by old laptopi got this product because for some reason my laptops internal wifi and bluetooth stopped working now there are options to buy two separate devices but this solves my purpose and it doesnt sticks out as wellits having dual wifi but i will suggest you to use on ghz as the ghz is a bit slow slower then the regular ghzits a good device good strength plug and play so no installation neededbut got a defective device first which malfunction immediately on plugging replaced it with a new one and its been working wellusing it for a couple of months now this has proved to be the much helpful adapter i needed when i moved my pc from wired to wireless in a different room getting speeds of mbps in my mbps subscription speeds
3,charging power is very less it takes hours to charge even a single phoneok type product not very sturdyalthough it is written fast charging however it charges quite slow compared to original chargers even when one mobile is charged at one timewhen using a regular cable it takes about hrs for a full charge when using this cable to the same socket and charger it showing hrsiphone charger last for two months onlycharging not fastslow chargingamh battery watt charger khant full chargeslow charging speed

4,about amazonbasicsxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxamazon basics was launched in is amazons own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goodshere amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand already exist in the market but at lower prices simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable pricesif something isnt an immediate hit amazon pulls it and moves onamazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product but with amazonbasics amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers onlineas an additional benefit amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined immediately taken care ofabout our product requirement vs actualxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxi recently purchased a new qualcomm qbix car charger was looking for a cable with usb a to micro b connector i listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements data exchangesince it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car data exchange capability was not much of my concern preference though would surely have been a usb but it didnt bother me if i could only get a usb tooactual product i did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and i found it to be pretty well i did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred the more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed length of the cable again since i could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob i preferred to keep it short simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or belowactual product the cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely meters or approximately feet long the length was sufficient for me to plugin any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passengers seat tangle free flexibility strength standardsi am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent i wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunchedactual product the cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility reasonable thickness a sturdy intermediate cable the whole construction of the cable due its cable size flexibility is almost tanglefreethe associated cable was not exactly thick but cant be termed as thin or delicate too its not the thickest ive seen but then thickest doesnt always means most durable given my application its more than just suitablethe overall built quality of the cable insulation looks promising enough to last few years even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last longi had further shortlisted mansaa an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement compact moulded connectorshad an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal pcbsactual product there are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable the connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open the connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spacesthe connector ports are sturdy enough both at usb a micro b ports the micro b port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite goodno signs of loose constructionbeing goldplated is more of a misleading fancy termin this case as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways availability of tiesvelcro straps as per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance i expected an included cable tie or a velcro strap would be a nice addon to properly adjust arrange the cable as per requirementactual product this i miss the most in the provided actual cable there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which i could adjust my required cable length easily decent current handling capabilityon the newest qc certified chargers the current transmission can go up to amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling abilityactual product the actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to amps against demands at new qc chargers that could go up to amps here let me clear out that the latest qc chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging thus it is not like a continuous flow of amps is there it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above amps would sufficiently work with qc chargershave tried it safely multiple times charging my samsung s from without the cable getting hot warrantycomes with a year warranty as expected not the best in the industry but reasonableother observationsapart from the above listed features the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are the cable is manufactured in china imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name philosophy of amazonbasics the cable has a manufacturing date of oct it was imported to india in dec the cable has a mrp tag of bucks however i purchased it online for bucksbeing a prime member shipping was free a customer care toll free number email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievancesfinal verdictxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxit has been few days since i have received been using this product so far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around i suppose its worth itwill surely update if any malfunction is observedworth for buythe quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination simply superb goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition make in india is good but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in r and d without r and d make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers govt should infact encourage such competitionamazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devicesas an past customer of many cables from amazon this cable doesnt also disappointsupports fast charging for all my samsung phonesi use samsung apro samsung splus which this cable is compatible with very sturdy thick and very long ftvery affordable pricing thanks amazoni also use a usb c cable for my samsung sfesuperproduct charging is ok however its mere foot in length the vendor could have mentioned correct product description there is no need to mislead too early to say performance as i have received it todaygoodi have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in rs and rs of ubon and of many other chinese local companiesand none of them worked properlyfinall i decided to go for thisand it is charging as well transferring data without any issue and i am very happy with my purchasemy advice dont buy cheap chinese local cables ofyou will have to throw them in dustbean after some timebetter buy this one
4,i am using this on an old mac mini since the broadcom proprietary drivers arent available and the replacement b drivers dont allow for sufficient download speeds at least in my experience i got this device up and running with ubuntu with linux genericgoogle search for morrownrau and use the driver on github im using the product tplink ac btw if you are using the other variant sold on amazon use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for giyfi will admit this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell bash for example but even though i had never used dkms or iw before the github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working read the github readmeto be sure i first got the drivers working in a local ubuntu vm using guest additions to connect to the usb device directly from the guest os which also workedultimately i installed the os on the host and setup the drivers using usb tethering i then got the same download speed using this device i was previously getting on my other network interfaces on windows and mac but now on ubuntuthe device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed have been using for about a month now without complaintsdo not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali me and some of my friends all are using it for wifi hacking and it works really well it also supports monitor mode if you are having issues in connecting it to your kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this tp link adapter to your kali machine there is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machinei have given it stars just because the performance if not good as the alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buynice product working fine my pc is now g price is too high so giving stargot the wifi in one of the rooms from to has been working well since a month now good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the wifi from a cornerthe product is very nice and have good wifi signal using this for over a month now no complain but when it for the first time you need to install the driver on your desktoplaptop from the tp link website to make it operational which is not very well explained in the manualthis product is very goodi have buy this product because my laptop dont support wifi ghz band in ghz i receive mbps speed only but my broadband plan is mbps easy to use plug and play windows good signal i am using another room from router no signal drop i receive full signal little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal i receive mbps download and mbps upload speed on ghz and my broadband plan is mbpsi highly recommend this producti purchase this product for company use and this is a very good product
4,it cost should be under rs buy itcolor is as per the photo but takes longer to charge also doesnt charge on all socketsseems to work better when plugged in directly in the laptoplength of the cable is long so that you can happily use it for long distance as week and quality is really good meter pink charging wire for iphone x long and strong one for usei have been using this lighting cable for almost a month now and the cable turned out exactly as it was shown i took the rose gold one that matches my phones color although the metal ends of the cable was rose gold but the whole cable was pink which i didnt like i went for the m long cable so that i can use it conveniently even if it is charging though its kinda bulky yet serves its purpose charging speed is fast and efficient just like the original cable had also quite durable and sturdy my apples original lighting cable had some problem while charging so i purchased this one after watching many youtube videos and reviews it was indeed a good purchaseits long and goodits a superb product in terms of sturdiness looks and charging speed
4,i got this for k at this price point i believe the tv provides decent quality you shouldnt expect amazing quality anyway from a x screen resolution the audio is also okay beyond the audio starts crackingfrom a viewing distance of ft the quality looks goodplease note you will struggle quite a bit to directly add a firestick to the hdmi port they have given some other ports right next to the hdmi ports because of which the firestick doesnt have proper space to fit properly unless you really shove it in there my suggestion is to get an hdmi extender for itoverall id say for a small room its a value for money satisfied with the product till nowthis led tv low budget good performance but picture audio not good is great but the installation guy asked me for paid installation misleading information but again for this price its good tv dont pay installation guy you can do it yourselfi will give it stars out of i bought this inch vw at after discounts picture quality and sound quality is goodi added firestick to it and it voila became smart tv the connections to attach these usbs are at the bottom part of the tv which is slightly different from other tvsso far working as it shouldrevising this after days the tv is not responding to switch off button this is happening more when i watch the tv for a few hours and then when i switch off the tv with the firestick remote the yellow colour indicator down below does not turn red instead it remains yellow as far as screen is concerned the tvs screen changes to black whitish seems to me that the tv goes into hibernation or sleep mode this is a fault of the tv as a normal tv should swith off completely and the indicator should turn red i have called technician tomorrow and if he checks and if he agrees then i should get a replacement as i got still days time to replace itjust a helping note for people buying this tv if you are going to connect firestick to it as it asks for the brand name of the tv you can select vu and it will perfectly work on your firestick thanks and enjoy

4,yeap this cable support w fast charging tested on my w brick of realme procable and pins quality looks goodsince i couldnt find original cable for w charger of realme i was searching for long time for a good onecharging speed depends on number of factors and only in best condition it will go above watts and the brand only claims that watts fast charge if only you use the brands inbox charger for me personally i tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two i never got speed above watt and i tested it with the cable that i received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if youre conditions are good and you get speed more tha watss then only you should buy it or you should go with aa cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cablesthe cable supports fast charging im using a oneplus w charger as advertised if it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable that would make it more durable in my experience braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily my cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent i submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within days ive been using boat cables for about years now a cable from a moto g phone is still with me and in use and will stick to themgot the original one but there are fake cables being sold so bewareit warp charges as it supports a power supply the cable is long and sturdy compared to the typical oneplus cable in the box the price of original oneplus cable is mrp but this i got for and is not unlike other third party wires definitely worth it best in price segment and durable material tangle free alsiamazon send me a used product but the cable is super and support fast charging and the quality is also good but they sent me a used product by others if not its super product and years of warranty on it just buy itvery good quality fast charging cable getting good quick charging through laptop alsoflat cable design makes it more durablei have a oneplus t with watts chargemy original wire had been destroyed few years ago and was searching for a cable with va for fast charging i had buyed many wires but the phone was not charging as fast as he original one this wire has a good build quality and can do watts a
4,product is good and also its strudiness but no fast charging in this cable its normally charging i love it because its supported in micro usb or type c over all good pros advantage meter wire more durable supported dual mode type c micro usbcons disadvantages normal charging not fast chargingthough it is braided but it is not strong like boat but its okay to use it supports turbochargingworking well after months of use only thing is that if there is slight pressure the c type adapter will come off from the micro usb head so better to see that the cable is not stretched when using the c type adapter otherwise working fine and very convenient for me since i usually have a phone with c type charging and a small tab with micro usb charging when i travel i need to carry only one cable now with my powerbank will recommendbest cablegoodboth micro usb type c mobile connectors are getting chargegood decision to purchase this productcable is a good fibre braided with good lengththe connector also has a tight fit sometimes you have to apply a bit force to removeig itll wear off after usagein comparison boat has a better quality i would say if u get that in offer as it has metal braided cable and better quality microusb pini like the product bcuz its help me to charge both phone type c micro cabel

4,tv looks fine however i see some lag while selecting the applications such as amazon prime etc i didnt install any new appsreceived the tv on timegood things about tv and tcl quick response after the tv is delivered call the customer care for the installation and within hour technician arrive and installed the tv after that received call back from the customer care to gather the experience and pinged on whatsapp so that if in future encountered any issue quick help will be provided quality quality of tv is good and can watch all the contents from the apps in max resolution supported by tv ie p steal deal during the gif sale received the tv in which is just wow price sound quality is good android is good and the extra feature which i find beneficial when compared to my old android tv is the voice search feature which now search the content from another apps also after giving permission which is not working on android tv bluetooth remote with some extra feature bought the tv as already have the tcl s inch model back in when it is launched and tv is working flawlessly and since did not encountered any issue so bought this brand tv again when required second tvimprovement bluetooth remote should have the all apps button on remote instead of tcl menu which my previous android s tv have due to which have to move with some extra click which is annoying for my parents to use in bluetooth remote they provide some extra button to move directly to youtube netflix tcl channel prime guard and media instead of this some customization be provided so that we can configure the buttons to some others apps as per our personal use out of these button guard media and tcl channel are most useless button android tv should come with atleast gb as with gb variant the tv is little slow and already have many preinstalled tcl apps which we cannot remove so tv experience in little bit slow however buy the model by knowing this limitation as already using gb ram old variant of the same brandother feature are also these which are cons but those are already mentioned in description and user should be aware of them before buying like one such point is star is removed because of point and point as it is not making fluid experience of using android tv when watch all the contents from the appsgood for value almost all apps r able to downloadless weight and pretty valuable to the budget and even customer support also available all timelikegood one for this price thanks to amazonvery good product

4,good looking amd working finei brought this primarily because my lenovo laptop windows has only one usb port no ethernet slot and one cconnector portwhile in office immediately after purchase of this tplink ue port usb hub and gigabit ethernet adapter i used this for the ethernet connectivity to my office network simultaneously i was using the usb ports in the hub for connectivity of my wireless mouse and one port for external harddisk this continuously gave me problems with connectivity of the mouse or the hdd i got errors like usb device not detected etc till a point where it refused to detect my mouseat home i used the hub for connecting only to my external hdds two numbers and it is working fine for a moment i was trying to return the product but since i got this delivered in mumbai at my office and then i had returned home to karnataka it refused to process return in a different cityright now it is working fine since i do not need ethernet at homespeed is more than wirelessi am not used since it restricted in my systemi have used it with hp and dell laptop its compatible with all its plug and play and easy to usegood productit works perfectlya trusted and a reliable brand with a convenient design having a slot for folding the cable it works and works well every timehowever they made strange design decisions that take some points off the satisfaction of using of the product there is a bright white light on the product which keeps flashing when the connection is active it is a huge annoyance when im working at night the cable is flat which is like a doubleedged sword on one hand it comes in handy when folding it on itself and redacting into the body but when its not hidden and used with a laptop with the adapter being visible the flat cable folded sideways looks uglythe product wouldve been a perfect if tp link didnt make these strange design decisions hope this helps thanks

4,hi all firstly i was very skeptical to purchase tv through online secondary iam a big fan of sony and lg brands thirdlyas i have year old kid at home i was so scared to spend money beyond k ofcourse at the first day sale for prime members when the amazon great indian festival started i saw one plus and hisense ah were priced at under k including bank offers and my favourite sony inch was priced at k but discarded sony just bcz of expensive and scared if my kid whilst playing will break it so i was continuously searching for budget friendly tvs like tcl redmi nokia and iffalcon but didnt like the inch tv suddenly out of the blue on thursday that is on october i saw this blowing offer on hisense vivid k tv but scared to buy but i felt offer was tempting so took the risk and bought it for deal price icici bank credit card instant discount so technically bought it for so i felt worth the risk and bought it on nd october tv was delivered to me and immediately i raised installation request and technician came on october and installed the tvthats my journey from searching to installationnow coming to initial impressions picture id say being a va panel i can clearly see blacks are not so deep they are bit of greyish kind however colours are not over saturated i felt they are normal and when i looked at tv from sides i can clearly say it doesnt come near to ips panel display but yeah for an average user like me its sufficient remote its simple major apps hotkeys are given yt amazon prime video hotstar which is good voice assistant is enabled simple and user friendly experience it lacks hands free google assistant sound i personally felt if watts audio given in the tv it would have been great but only watts given which is crisp and clear though i increased volume upto to chk but no distortions nothing its clear dialogues and bass but if a soundbar is added it will be added advantage ui it comes with android it doesnt matter to me as im a very average user so runs the show for me i hope hisense sends the ota updatenow to the main point as u can see my pictures i see specially in amazon prime video app on the blue screen there are some lines which i dont know whether its problem with panel or application need to chk with amazon customer service for the reason if any user can help or enlighten me on this issue that would be super conclusion frankly speaking i bought this tv only bcz i got it almost under bought for including extended warranty for years bcz even if some mishap happens when the kids playing it wont pinch me so from my perspective i felt its okay with some minor issues like sound i just need to get clarity on that prime video issue if that is sorted i will be happyhappy diwali to teami have bought this tv at and at this price tag its a great purchasepicture quality is good not at per with sony or lg k tv but better than its rivals like mi redmi vu etc va pannel works fine and gives good amount of blacksprosandroid tvsoundcolourconsremoteloved the picture qualityaverage picture quality but ok for this priceworth for the cost nice quality and claritygoodgood productgood support team as unit reached within hours installation done within time of installer called demo properly given and company call also received in days for confirmation of material delivery and installation done proper way
4,its really worth it i am using it to get output on another display from my laptop through this wire till now its really good and build quality is really goodi had problem with my last hdmi cable as anyone at home switch onoff any switch my desktop display goes off for a secwith this dp to hdmi its all good my problem has gone excellent product and service value for moneythis cable is very useful if your cpu has display port out monitor has hdmi port in other way it wont work cable is of good quality best packaging by amazonnice productmy pc has an hdmi port while my lg monitor has dp port my monitor doesnt detect this as a valid input signal when using this converter a normal dp to dp port connection works just fine it is hence important to note that the cable might not work universallyft display to hdmi cable working fine very good at inrthe product is good long enough for my pc setup i didnt experience any loose connection with this yet been using it for almost monthsyou can go for it
4,seems ok have not tried it with hd quality videos value for moneyvery high and in budget hdmi cable by amazon basicnicei bought this for my android tv stick and it works very good with itquality of the cable is very good and richit doesnt lose the picture and sound quality of tv stickit is working as expectedi purchased splitter but it didnt work properly and ordered for hdmi male female wire which helped me to view sources properlygood serves the purpose had to buy this as for some weird reason the amazon firestick bern working for years is no longer working when connected to my samsung tvs hdmi port all ports searching in google did not help as this issue seem to be common with samsung tvs but with no possible solution so wanted to check if the firestick works in my computer monitor but the hdmi slot in the monitor was unreachable for a direct connection and hence bought this cable the firestick worked well with monitor whats even weirder is the firestick works fine when connected to the same samsung tv using this cable problem solved although no clue how the hell it got fixed the quality of this cable is quite good been using it for a couple of months now to connect a laptop or a desktop to a dell monitor picture quality for full hd works fine along with sound output not sure about k though since i dont have a k monitor price should be less than rs which i paid should be in the rs to rs considering the quality and other alternative products available in the brick and mortar stores if you are willing to pay a bit extra then this is just fine
4,apart from dispatch of the item by amazon the ifalcon smart tv is a good buy for the value of money picture is crystal clear enjoy it with high speed internet in smart tv but low sound quality k its worth value for moneygood picture quality and soundsatisfied customer value for money product is ok as per pricegood picture quality sound as well
4,my lg smart k tvs magic remote went kaput and since lgs magic remotes are super pricey i decided to give this one a try besides the air mouse and motion gestures everything else works absolutely finealso the lightweight remote and its form factor feels really nice and cozy in hands however the buttons have no dots or rivets over its buttons which sometimes makes you forget which key you are pressingother than that its a great remote controllerthis product is good for work from my box tv having my original magic remote go kaput i was not sure if this remote would work on my inch lg smart tv however a huge relief it works and works like a smooth operator using the keys no need of any set up etc it doesnt have voice or scroll button but i anyways was not using that feature in my original magic remote since that consumes batteries to a great extent forcing you to change batteries every days dont waste money buying expensive ones go for thisfunctionally very good and it is a good replacement for the original remote on which the power switch had stopped working i havent had to use most of the other functionsgood performancecheap and best alternative for your lg remote magic mouse option is not there but works fine with my lg tvworks as expected the response is little slow but thats still fine
4,made up of good quality materialno issue till date value for moneyi checked many products in amazon this is very nice productused to connect mixer to my obage dt tower speakers gives best sound qualityi use it to connect my zebronics sound system to my pc yeah it does the job really goodniceusing with subthe cable is good connectors are also strong but price is too highworking just as fine as m cable that my speaker company has provided good quality gold pleted premium looks
4,the color is not same as what is shown in images rest the quality is goodgo for it it is useful and strong also but buy in sale or discounted price onlybest for daily use bit be alert from delivery man of dtdc of amazon even they are ready for anything like gundasusing from several months very good product if you want to avoid the cable this is a best producteco dot rdproduct does its work but quality can be improved edges are not smooth and is made of poor quality plastic no shine but dull outlook still ok to buy in this pricethe product correctly holds the echo dot as well as the cables without hindering the flat placement on the wall the position of the holder can be shifted slightly as well in terms of distance from the wall because the holder can slide on the adapter these are the biggest pros for the product as for the cons the product could improve on the plastic quality and texturequality need to improve but not bad happy to purchaseif your power outlet is not going to hold the charger stronger dont go for it it might fall down
3,the in charger is very much useful as there are still people who uses micro usb as well as cnice cable in budget product and durablegoodi am not satisfied quality of product is good fast charging supported cannot use with wall chargers as the length is short good to use with powerbank and laptopsjustifying pricewire size too smallnot woking prodact amazon isuss cebals bad prodactsi i am nit use this prodatcs not retun track pleess pikup prodacts
4,cable otherwise goodi like the productquality is good but after a month immediately i lose of battery health so thats why i stop using itnot sturdy cable will break in just weeksi suggest this productnice
4,theres no magic remote and lg should include it by default as it makes life easier the magic remote costs around k approximatelydisplay when turned on tv and tested the display on black wallpaper found very small green and white dotsimmediately called up amazon first and then we scheduled a tech visitthe tech did not come rather spoke on call and asked whats the problem and when informed about the problem he said needs to be replaced but no body came with itso i waited for days again and nothing was showing up on amazon app about replacement so doubting it i called up amazon customer care again and explained everything again and finally spoke to some one and she said she will get it replaced and i was given another date within daysthis time the replacement came and was goodamazing picture quality and sound clarity but only drawback is that it did not come with a magic remotethe television is good but the installation service is pathetic first of all they did not contact us till days after the tv delivery and we got frustrated and call lg customer service and they accepted our problem and send a technician after hours and while installing the mount he installed bolts successfully but he broke the last bolt and we asked him will it not cause a problem in future he said it wouldnt but we dont really believe himgoodvery nice good quality best in this pricenice choicebest deali like lgworth for price very good
4,absolutely value for money i connect it with my samsung inch uhd tv jbl soundbar and jio set top box all is working zakkaass picture quality improved compared to my earlier cable now getting dolby with this set up thumbs up for this itembest product at fair price quality of the cable is too goodmust buy picture clearity upto the mark
3,the remote looks very similar to the original one doesnt need any specific setup and is already tuned to the sony bravia led tv of oursperfectly workingworking fine so farbest remote in the market i am using and controlling sony smart tv easy to use working smoothly till dateall functions are working best replacement remote in competitive pricedoesnt perform like an originalreasonable product but of not good qualitylike expected all required functions work without any issues remote itself is made of high quality plastic not sure how many years it will last but build quality look and feel sturdyits working but buttons are not good
4,the product was nice its charging awesomecant say anything about durability and sturdiness as the part which gets connected to adapter seems to be in a highly vulnerable state with a flick of hand it might get bent as my last charging chord got to be so i had to buy this one something must be done about thatvery good worth the moneyi had to replace the cable that i had recieved with my laptop i opted zoul and am highly satisfied by the cable its durable and works seamlesslythis is an amazing product from zoul i bought many other cables before from other brands but they didnt work that well but this i must say is the best of all in terms of charging power durability and sturdiness much recommendive been using this cable for over months with my galaxy s its been working flawlessly fast charging works as expected and the m length makes it convenient to use it in bed would recommend to anyone looking for a long cable infact my brother purchased one after seeing me buy itthe cable has good length charges very fast
3,tv remote is the replica of the original one supplied with tv the original one served for about one and half year the remote came without any battery performance since last few days is satisfactory but amazon has similar remote with lessor price but cant asses the quality alternatively one can operate by downloading the remote from play store in android but may be little inconvinience to operateworking fine but the quality of outer case is low quality can be purchasethe pairing of this remote was little tough and also some times remote is not working after i use the voice recognition the buttons are hard to press when compare to the original remote which came with the smart box so find a original piece and go for itremote is faulty it looses its connectivity with the tv atleast times in a day so i have to pair it timesi want a replacement please arrange a call back from the customer service teamvalue for money sturdy quality need voice recognition improvementmust add a note that you must switch on tv manually and then pairworking is good no issuebut material quality is not up to mark
4,i recently purchased the kodak tv from amazon and overall my experience has been satisfactory the picture quality is good and the streaming capabilities are convenient the user interface is easy to navigate although it did take me a little bit of time to get used to ithowever i do have a few issues with the tv the sound quality is not the best and i have noticed some lag when switching between apps these issues do not significantly impact my viewing experience but they are worth mentioningdespite these issues i would still give the kodak tv stars out of it is a decent tv for the price but there are certainly better options out there i was offered an additional months of warranty if i wrote a review but i am not particularly interested in extending the warranty at this timeit is not appropriate or ethical to write a false or misleading review in exchange for incentives such as an extended warranty or other perks doing so goes against amazons guidelines and can lead to consequences for both the customer and the companyit is important to be honest and transparent in your reviews and to only write about your genuine experiences with a product this helps other customers make informed decisions about their purchases and ensures that the review system remains fair and trustworthyif you are not satisfied with the kodak tv or do not feel comfortable giving it a high rating it is perfectly okay to give it a lower rating or to not write a review at all it is always better to be honest and genuine in your reviews rather than attempting to manipulate the system for personal gainissues with chrome castingi did not believe such a good feature would be available at this price i liked the feature of supporting the ethernet port and earphone jackkodak tvfor the amount being charged this is a acceptable tvthe kodak xpro model is same as thomson a seriesdespite being big this was lighter than my previous bravia tv and easily mounted to the previous wallmount note the wall mount holes are plasticky and dont have any metal insertthe remote sensor is separate module projecting from the underside of the tv and does not look integrated with the main bodythe two usb ports are side by side which dont interfere with each otherthe audio out port is a good feature if one wants to watch tv without disturbing otherswhen i first connected the tv to my settop box over hdmi there was only picture and no soundthe person at the service center whose number is listed on the tvs warranty card said that they dont support this and i need to call the tv manufacturer so much for printing a service center number on warranty cardthis was fixed after changing the hdmi cec settings in the settop box not tvs faultthere is no usermanual given with the tv most people based on their experience with phone should be able to ultimately figure out the connections the only included leafletbook whose pages were all stuck together talks about the android menu there is no info on the tvs input jacks like what the hdmi arc stands fori got multiple calls after the purchase to enquire about delivery and if i needed installationas i already had a previous wall mount on which this could get attached with no hassles i opted out of installation serviceall is welllllgood tvpicture quality is very good
3,value of moneyusually gdgood productgoodquality is poor and responce is latethis it what youve been looking for i guessquality is okk not bed it all but its body is not proper tight or fixedthe product is of poor quality and seems like duplicate remote doesnt work properly
4,it works more than expected little bit lose but other than that it works well till date it is really long and that is so much usefulquality is goodlove itno issues so farbought for around rupees cable is little bit lengthier they have mentioned the length of the cable too so cant complain it overall the product is far far better best and worth for the pennybuild quality is great looks good as well my last amazonbasics cable lasted around years so i am expecting the similar from this onenot supporting for carplay and this product i want to cancel but amazon dont have option to cancel sturdy and durable using since one month no issues reportednice product by amazon basics
4,the cable does support fast pd charging i have tried it on my laptop and also tried it on the powerbanktested on the samsung watt charger and it worked fine for the phone tried the same on charger on laptop for pd charging though it charged the laptop but the cable point does heat up quite a bit so there are chances that if a watt charger is used it may heat up a lot overall the cord is well make very sturdy and the materials indicate that this cord will be very very durable the price would could have been on the lower side due to heating otherwise its a good buygood for buylike iti got this for my samsung s lite and it is compatible with super fast charger and charged my phone in super fast charge mode value for money could not post picture but product is good far better than original samsung cable which cost almost samethe cable is sterdy the ends are premium charges my one plus t rapidly great data transfers on my macbook as well i am happy with the purchasegood cableworth it quality of cable is very good supports fast charging in samsung galaxy devicesideal for charging but not for data transfergives an average speed of to mbps with my ssd capable of more than mbps transfer speed and actually gives with its provided cable

4,tv on off not working so difficult to battery really a bad product
3,this review is for the native fhd projectoryes it is a native p led projector connected this to my desktop computer and tested also dont bother trying to play videos from usb quality is badbut when connected to right streaming or display source thru hdmi it is actually quite good i mean picture quality colours brightness etc for a sub k projector in this department this projector can easily compete with many projectors in sub k rangessound is also pretty much okay loud enough more like boat w speakers may be a bit more louder not good quality wise quitr workable as portable solution but not for a permanent setupaudio output to my studio headphones are pretty decent quality wise and loud also meaning speakers can be connected to it for a higher setup person has to figure out to seperate the audio at the source itselffrom ft and inches distance of lens to wall we can get exactly inch inch x inch projection so it can be called as short throw projector albiet may be border level there is an option to reduce the screen size upto of original size electronically once connected to hdmikeystone correction is not usuable at all that wheel has to be exatly in middle position to get a good focus on whole screenthat means one has to setup the projector or screen at a fixed location can not lilt the projector to move screen up or down and then adjust with keystone correction i e if you want to keep the projector screen at lower levels projector also has to fixed at lower levels only best focus can be get when projecting exactly oppsite to the projector probably to inch above so if we flip the projector upside down we get best focus opposite to center a few inches downfor mysetup where projecting only feet above from the floor going to use a wall mount to setup the projector upside down this way i can fix the projector a bit more abovebehind the sofa i will post the pics later once it is setup properlynow the verdict this projector with a combination of reflective projector screen look it up on amazon xelectron or minago brand is one of most vfm combo for approx k for experiencing a very bright inch screen experience of good quality for or person but now that im considering buying one of those expensive fixed frame alr projector screens costing upward of k to k im thinikg it would have been better if i could have invested a bit more on a brighter projectorlook only ansi value this buy was more of an impulse purchase but it is more then good enough for me now to make me consider much costlier projector screens and then later upgrade to a high end projectoredit the biggest drawback of this projector is that dust gets inside on lcd panel which impacts the clarity also after a few days i had to clean the panel myselg just after month new lesson learnt apart from high ansi lumen projector this is also an important factor for future purchase planning to get a custom cloth cover made so that i dont have to clean it often though lcd cleaning can be done pretty easily without much opening and its easier compared to youtube videos i have seen for previous model somehow lens did not get any dust inside yet only the lcd has very very fine dust particles insidequality is good value for money bluetooth connectivity is smooth and fast the sound quality of the projector is not so great but that we had already considered before hotstar app really works nicely with great quality and so does youtube netflix prime video doesnt give the same quality initially but that must be wifi connection some apps however dont get installed or just close on their ownthe good point is the bluetooth connection and even we have added a bluetooth soundbar so moving it and putting it in any room has become a really good optionthis is indeed a fantastic product in this price rangeit is non android so you need to add an amazon fire stick or some other source device through hdmineedless to say the brightness is pretty good for dark environments and is also watchable during day ie if you can cover up your windows and other light sourcesscreen spread is almost up to inch at a throw distance of to feet with the sharpness more or less intactconverts k to pwill recommend a tripod mount or a custom made mount like mineensure that the walls are white for best image video reproductiondefinitely recommended at this price pointconsonly vertical keystone correction availableprojector is good so far as it used for last days may revisit the feedback after a couple of monthsi bought this projector for my classroom and its very helpful for their studies now students connect themselves more to the worldi feel its a value for money product as i have already used it for last two monthsif u r looking for a home entertainer projector look no further this is it best in price good picture quality brightness and a decent remote with good functionality as always premium buyers avoid as these r for normal home with normal needs very good for family get together movie nights and kids will be awe struck at its enormity ive canceled my dth connection coz amazon prime tv stick with this projector is all i need thats all the time i have for watching tv amidst my work and they do the job well an entertaining night after a busy day n you will be done satisfied any queries ping me ill help u as much as i can dont worry abt specs and other details takeit from a family manit will satisfy all ur needsbe it surfing movies or gaming and with fire tv stick mirroring is possible too hope it helpsupdate after months hrsday usage the pic uploaded was by noon pm with dark screenshi this was a reply to a customer to help choose between egate i n uc but i thought if this was put up in update section a lot would benefit so here it goesfirst u need to be clear on ur purpose for this projector like if its for offic use or home entertainment also u didnt mention its source like dth or fire tv stick etc since u have not ill go with a general review for purposes its going to be a very detailed review so guys with out patience can run to the end at oncei too had a similar confusion based on competition for egate i from uc let me tell u what helped me decidefirst n foremost egate is an indian company unlike uc which is a common chinese product with a namesake brand uc confirmed it with my friend in china hence service n general trust is more on egate than competitionsecondly from fellow customers ive learnt that egate is brighter than the rest twothirdly the images are sharp and theres no blur on text on egate compared to the other two just learn to adjust the keystone properlyfourth the length of the power cord is longer in egatefifth its got a lens cover to close the lens when not in use the others dont have itnow in general ive not used the other two but the input of data for the other two are from their users so im gonna tell u wat ive done n wat else u can do with egateive placed it at a length of feet from the screen n it gives awesome display connect a home speaker system if u r trying for home theatre effect but the inbuilt speaker is good enuf at feet projection from the end of ur bed with kids sleeping aroundive connected my second fire tv stick with it so it connects to wifi for movies n serials n mirroring is done by it for playing from mobiles n game too like cod n pubg n ff also u have connectivity for laptop n pendrive etcu get a remote which functions well along with itmost importantly u can ceiling mount it or tripod it too which the other two cant but remember if u r ceiling mounting it u need to flip the display by in the settings coz u would mountbit upside down as the option is provided under the projector but for tripod its not necessaryalso u can place the projector behind the screen like an actual theatre if u r using a cloth screen like me n constraint of space but remember to flip the image from right to left in settings as the projector is behind the screen n u need to get a flipped image from behindso i guess its the d part that made ur decision murky wat i would love to say for that is ive a samsung d enabled smart tv n ive seen the output of these kind of cheap d devices too since its a low cost projector d effects are going to give u a headache coz of pixelation better to opt for a tv if d is a priority as in tv the d effects r awesome but nowadays u can install an app in any device to watch d movies or better download a d movie in pendrive n play it n watch it with ur d glasses my friends do it but i dontverdict best projector in market in my opinion for the price and home entertainment purposenote for amazon prime n netflix users if u r using a audio output sometimes u might not get audio so dont get worried n its nothing wrong with the projector its just that the latest movies are made with dolby sound so just use the on screen setting in the video to navigate to sound n choose stereo from the default dolby option voila u r donehope it helps ping me for any doubtshit like if my review was usefulas per money its bestbut if you are fan of pictures qualitythink about budget

4,i purchased the cable for my galaxy note in july have been using it since and it works neat the cable is tough due to its braided natureoverall good for usage not faced any quality issues c point section is also good to fit properly in mobile you can go for itmost expensive cable i have ever purchased probably the best cable too giving star less for the premium pricingi bought this as the long cables dont work well with android car this works very well go for it if you have to connect with android autoshort reviewthis eliminates a need to wrap long cables around the handlebar when the phone is mounted on it for navigation compact and powerful best suited for motorcycle mobile mounts and powerbanksprice bought at _______________________________________________________________________________________long reviewi used to wrap long charging cables around the handle bar so that it wont come in the way while turning after being fed up of wrapping cables to handlebars i wanted something short just to sit there and charge device and clear the clutter on motorcycle handle this is just what i wantedi have a mobile mount that looks like bobo gears jaw grip mount from local stores and that delivers v a tried few cables from local stores and they either die or doesnt charge the device enough when it is in use even when the device is not in use the charging rate used to be lowthat is when i have decided to give this one a try as i was always hesitant that for a short cable is too high now i am pretty happy with the purchase that it can fetch the complete charging capacity of the mobile charger and deliver it to the device i did a kms roundtrip and this has been a saviour i am yet to check if the claimed qc is true but at least it serves the purpose on my motorcycle handlebar so i have no complaints i will update when i get a chance to test thatcoming to the design and quality the braided cable looks rugged and the metal connectors feel solid as i am going to use it only on the motorcycle i am sure i will put it through some abuse and i can comment on the same when i revisit this review for updatesdurabilityi will have to use it more and update this review on the durability perspective as my first wayona dash charge cable i used for oneplus died in months but thankfully it was replaced under warranty that shows how good the support is from wayona team i only had to record that the cable died and doesnt charge any more and they too that video as evidence to replace the productverdictif you are looking for a short cable for mobiles on or for charging devices from powerbanks i would definitely recommend this cabledata transfer is quite fast and also compatible with my qc adaptergoodexcellent worth for the moneynice wire fast charge

3,when i say android tv few buyers wouldnt be able to grasp it it has unofficial build of android so basically you can install all android tv apk and apps for play store you can install aptoide manually and it can install all bunch of tv apps for your afterwardssince its unofficial build you cant have google app services and play store it wont work at all overall happy with thispicture quality greatapps does not lagdoes not hangsnot having heating issueonly problem is apps and functions arent organised you needed to go through all the stuffsthere is a similar tv with official android its better to take that if you need official build as well as google play store and servicesoverall happy in budget wall mount was not found inside the tv packbetterproduct is good picture quality is ok i bought this product and also get discount final amount is at this price product is bestbut installation service is not goodwall mount is inside the box installation service man say rs for wall mount and otherwise no installationnice product very happypicture qualityvalue for money product
4,i got this for k at this price point i believe the tv provides decent quality you shouldnt expect amazing quality anyway from a x screen resolution the audio is also okay beyond the audio starts crackingfrom a viewing distance of ft the quality looks goodplease note you will struggle quite a bit to directly add a firestick to the hdmi port they have given some other ports right next to the hdmi ports because of which the firestick doesnt have proper space to fit properly unless you really shove it in there my suggestion is to get an hdmi extender for itoverall id say for a small room its a value for money satisfied with the product till nowthis led tv low budget good performance but picture audio not good is great but the installation guy asked me for paid installation misleading information but again for this price its good tv dont pay installation guy you can do it yourselfi will give it stars out of i bought this inch vw at after discounts picture quality and sound quality is goodi added firestick to it and it voila became smart tv the connections to attach these usbs are at the bottom part of the tv which is slightly different from other tvsso far working as it shouldrevising this after days the tv is not responding to switch off button this is happening more when i watch the tv for a few hours and then when i switch off the tv with the firestick remote the yellow colour indicator down below does not turn red instead it remains yellow as far as screen is concerned the tvs screen changes to black whitish seems to me that the tv goes into hibernation or sleep mode this is a fault of the tv as a normal tv should swith off completely and the indicator should turn red i have called technician tomorrow and if he checks and if he agrees then i should get a replacement as i got still days time to replace itjust a helping note for people buying this tv if you are going to connect firestick to it as it asks for the brand name of the tv you can select vu and it will perfectly work on your firestick thanks and enjoy

3,nd purchase reviewpurchased on july dash charge stopped working on september within monthsbut when i contacted them on the given whatsapp number they right away sent me a new cable the very next day stars for keeping the promise and professionalismfirst purchase reviewwriting after months of usageeverything happened as expected and written below after purchase after months cable stopped pc connectivity then after a month it started showing problems in charging it used to charge in one position only and charging used to stop with little movementfinally had to replace it with new one after monthssince the price is now reduced to so i will say good product in this price not long lasting if you want a reliable long lasting long length cable go for original from oneplus showroominitial review written just after purchaseyes it supports dash charge and no heating issues using it since daysone negative point is short length it is meter long original cable is meters so it is difficult to use my phone while chargingother negative point i can figure out is that cable is really hard in my experience hard cables break more often than soft pliable ones it is not easy to put a hard cable in my bag without putting strain on it for daily commute to office this makes them to break easily before timehard cables are also not easy to use when the mobile is charging it puts strain on both the points the charger side and mobile side which again makes it vulnerable to cracksthis raises a question on longevity of the cablelets do some calculationsmy original oneplus cable lasted for years cost of which at present is rs it was soft easy to bend and keep in my bag while traveling daily for work the rs cable online is meters long which makes it easy to work on phone while it is pluggedpopio cable costs rs at present but they show it which means price may rise so even if it lasts for months it will be more costly to me than an original cable in years popio cable is meter long against meters of original cable so effective price of popio cable is rs for meter cablepopio cable is meters long against meters of original cable which makes it not easy to use the phone while it is charging using a short cable while charging puts strain on the cable and phones charging port which is damaging for both and also decreases life of both the cable and charging portthey say you have to consider cost while writing review but you should also consider cost on long run not just the immediate cost so if u are thinking of changing your phone in coming future and dont want to spend too much on cable popio is the best option availablebut if you are looking for a long term solution and you can afford to buy rs cable i will suggest to go for the original one it has more length it is soft and it lasts longer with moderate usei ordered this cable for in the sale yesterday when i plugged in the cable it wasnt charging rapidly on my oneplus but then immediately i booked for a replacement cable which arrived this morning and i plugged it in and voila charging rapidly thankfulnd purchase reviewpurchased on july dash charge stopped working on september within monthsbut

4,update after months of use the tv is still going strong all the good points mentioned in the original review below are still true and very happy with the tvits as if oneplus have been listening to their customers after recent firmware updates the issues i had mentioned have almost disappeared we can now arrange and move apps youtube netflix as per our wish on the home screen itself i am finally able to put youtube first as it is the most used app for my toddler there is no more wifi disconnect issue noted earlier prime video still shows errors sometimes though i think thats an issue with the app and not the tvstrongly recommend this tvoriginal reviewi took a leap of faith in purchasing this tv as there were mixed reviews for it however after using it for months the following are my observationsgood the picture quality is fantastic there is no lag while watchingforwarding kk videos i saw a youtube review which said its brightness was low compared to other models the brightness is more than you would ever need from a tv i have never needed to run it on full brightness till now up to works for me for my toddler to watch rhymes i set brightness to and even then it is more than needed there were a few reviews that said the sound quality was average and you need a soundbar i disagree i have watched movies with up to sound and that is good enough for a sqft hall voice command it is quite accurate and i am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around feet away being able to control the tv from app is also a very useful feature no need to look for remote being able to cast from the app also helps a lot it would be even better if everything on phone not just pictures and videos could be cast using the appnot so good if the tv goes to sleepscreensaver for more than minutesa it often gets disconnected from wifi have to restart it againb prime video fails to resume displays error and have to restart the tv againc on the home screen you cannot rearrange apps to have your preferred apps first you can do it in apps window which is useless as you need to navigate to it first easier to navigate to your preferred app in the home screen itselfonly cons till now got fast moving object looks blurr which was known before buying by other user review but i got this tv in kao over all satishfiedonly minus that too critical is the installation service providerthe product is to installed by v care installation services providerthe installation service provider is a total waste and not responded properlyactual date of installation was on but was only done by the service provider on the executive who attended the installation is a total waste person and dont know how to behave to the customerhe behaved very rudelythe installation service provider is a total damage and waste not at all worthawesome quality of pictures and some issues with smart features like in app installation and in connection from smart phone only audio player in work properly but video not show in tvdolby atom k video etcgoodgood

4,im using it for dell inch monitor and i found it difficult to fit hence i had to visit the fabrication shop to smoothen the corners else it is really goodgoodquality of the product is good but it didnt clearly suit the samsung monitor i have i had to remove a specific part behind the monitor and adjusted this wall mount till now no issueproduct is good i am using benq exq monitor holds well enough but there are only places to screw it in this makes you doubt sometimes weather this can hold up the weight of the monitor i have been using it for the past months and havent faced any issueanother problem with this montioe is the rubber that is used for rotating the montioe is cheap and gets broken initially only but replaced with proper nuts and this worked fine for mefinal verdict good monitor wall mount easily taking kg of weight on itcould have been better if the rubber material and count of screw holes in the wall mount be moregreat product at reasonable rate very easy to install very sturdy product never feel like monitor will fall downself install a bit difficult the plate connecting to monitor could have been removable and drop in clamp this would make fixing a breezeits doing the job well my monitor is holding it firmly on the wall

4,amazon should provide mtr cable length very good qualitynice item received in good packagingthe cables is perfectly working and there is no color difference with itit works perfectly with gtx super asus tuf and dell d with single desktop across dual monitor setup multistream the trick to figuring out is how the cable fits your dp port both sides this fit in snugly with gtx and i knew this is gonna work no need to do any voodoo with pulling cables powering off this and that to make dp cable work just works straight out of the boxstrangely this cable didnt support my logitech g wireless gaming mouse lightspeed connection the dongle is attached to the st of the two dell d monitors mouse works when i am viewing over typec pd display with my laptops otherwise audio video resolution refresh rates didnt botherdurability could be a question lets wait and observe over the days a lot have commented that this cable didnt last longbest in the budgetthis is not vesa certified cable sometimes the monitor goes black for to secondthe product is good its been almost a week i am using this cable i am using a lg gm monitor p hz as soon as i installed this cable the display went on default refresh rate hz then i went into windows display settings as nvidia settings didnt have refresh rate more than hz to change the refresh rate to hz and it switched without any issues avoid jerks to the monitor as i figured the display goes off for a brief or secs post jerking rest the cable quality is good however locks to the display ports could be appreciated rest all is fine i hope this review might be helpful thank you

3,just got delivered theres lag in remote it takes like secs after pressing the remote keylike i said when you cant find the original remote to buy this can be handyno voice communicationit is acceptable for the price inr works as intended however buttons require additional force as its hardthe best thing about the remote is obviously that it worked no problems just put in the batterieswhich honestly should have been included and it worked the flip side is that the fit and finish is atrocious its so badly finished that when i first saw it i thought it was a fakeit couldnt possibly be realbutfor the price and the function it was perfectnot good because far not remote tvnear tv onlyvoice recognition is not available with this remote control so i return the item rest item is good for rest of the thingsgood remote ir censor and good buy instead of buying bluetooth one you can buy this one with affordable priceok for emergency keys are hard and might not work after months but is compatile with tcl android inch tv
4,affordable available and multi purpose cable best suitable for traveling and reducing overall cables to carrywarking fine build also goodit is a nice cable as it fits in most of the phones and devicessturdy one no fear of damage by wear and tearhowever i felt that the cable is heated up substantially with higher currentsthis uncommon in standard phone cables provided by oemsi have been using this cable from last few months and very much satisfied with the this product and i recommend to go for itthe cable quality is very good charging time is good with availability of different cable typesconsidering the price compared to competitors at market this is cheap but no compromises have been made with respect to sturdiness or quality the wires are wonderful despite using it for more over a month now no issues at all were faced regarding wire tangling torn out wires etc very sturdy and pretty easy to carryregarding charging speed it delivers what it promised the quality of the ports are also solid no issue had been faced at allpackaging was great performance of the product even greater the wires are long enough though in my personal opinion a little bit more lengthy would be icing on the cake making the product absolutely a perfect oneoverall very happy with purchasing it a great vfm product for all those having multiple type devices with them this one single cable has a solution to charging it allwarp charge is working fine and satisfactory lightning cable is working in normal condition rather than fats chargingbut overall the product is awesome and felt value for moneylike
4,shown pieces received only one also its not ft at all as mentioned did feel cheated charging is ok the reason i opted for this is just that i needed one iphone charger with usb portit is actually set of three feet cables both working fine for me bought for emergency use and having no issues after a monthbought months back onlyproduct is goodnice and value for moneygood product but be prepared for long lead timemisleading title and descriptionits not ft cablebetter to use original itemjust bought it so not sure of durability or sturdiness but it was very cheap and so wasnt sure how good will it work but it works perfectly fine
4,good packaging wire quality is goodvery good quality but the wire is meters only at least should be meters for the pricei am using this with an fd ax as my satellite speakers wires were getting very flimsy out of the box these cables are very thick compared to the ones my speakers had beforeafter replacing the cables with these ones i noticed two things right away my speakers are louder the sound quality is much betterone thing you wanna be careful is that these cables stick out like a sore thumb in front of white walls so if you are like me who cares about the looks you might wanna cover these with cable raceways or even paint them like i am planning to dowire is very best quality but cost not worth for itdurability n quality is absolutely goodthe product is gauge pure copper multi thread wires sound quality is impressivebears a black band for veve distinctionive seen many reviews where people complain that this cable is not copper its aluminium and even some saying its fake so i thought ill clear some doubts about this productits true this is not a pure copper cable its copper clad aluminium infact most of the speaker cables are copper clad aluminium majority of the audio signal travel through the outer edge of the conductor skin effect hence the copper cladding thicker the cladding better the audio quality this cable only got a thin cladding of copper the steelaluminium reinforced center is for a more durable conductor now no where in the description amazon has mentioned that this is a pure copper cladding cable so just need to get your expectations right you simply cannot expect oxygen free pure copper cable at this price rs you will not find a decent gauge copper speaker cable for less than rs this is a cheap gauge speaker and it does the job very well this cable is more than enough to deliver good sound to your speakers cable quality is average but you get what you pay for now if got some high end speakers then i wont recommend this cablegood
4,my inch tv fits fine also inch tv can be wall mount for sure good product quality various sizes screws and nuts included in this productnice producti am giving stars because screws provide in the product do not fit properly i had to get it separately to installi love to like its accuracy of fittingi had to makeshift the screws to fit the grill as the screws were long and had to add washer to make it fiti installed my selfit perfectly fit on my sony tv inch stand is sturdy and good deducting start as i dont see anything on the sides of the stand which can prevent my tv from falling on side so i had to little bit bend the sides of stand so that tv doesnt fall if someone pulls it from left or right otherwise its a good standnothing to write its a basic universal stand expensive here on amazon turns out the same thing was from at a local hardware electroniclight store
4,all is good except little loose coveri ordered this specifically for the colour it fits okay the product catches lot of dustpriced over is itemnice productit was a bit overpriced but a good quality product i did not receive the same blue color as showed in the description but received some glowing light blue colour which glows in darkremote stops working after monthsnice fit volume buttons should also be covered with transperant layer as symbols get wornbout over timeit is smooth made with rubberperfectly fits to my remote
3,ok with that price but has issues with power button and no voice supportgoodgoodmic is not workingvoice not working you cant enable voice assistant in this remotequality is average the buttons are not smooth and the range is not good but overall it is functioningvery niceusing it for days now after my original remote conked off after months and vu quoted rs for a new remotein this remote except for the voice control everything works perfectly cant comment on durability in days but as of now i am happy with this purchase
3,excellent productits just a day old now look wise its good sturdy and durable china product it says w capable dont know how to measure it but works good with my wats brickthe charging cable stopped working within weeks i opted for a basic and cheaper charging cable but all the money went in waste now i will have to buy another good quality cablebuild quality best in market and the cable provides a fast charging with w charger toovery slow charging didnt expect from cromadurable and fasti couldnt connect it to samsung mobilefast charge
4,the delivery people were not careful with the unpacking amazon needs to train their delivery staff on unpacking different types of things since they have come up with a policy where they need to open the package and verify any defects stars to them as they are not careful with the unpacking i could see that they were holding the tv panel while getting the tv out from the box and even after telling them to be careful they werent also the stand was just thrown on the front panel cause he has nit understanding where it was at when they opened the box which could have damaged the screenhowerver very satisfied with the sony installation the engineer has good hands on and very experienced with the installationtv picture quality is good wifi connection is little slow but it works mostly fine if router is nearby delivery was good and fast the sony installation service is very poor near bengaluru guy came late next day to scheduled day that too after calling many times he came and went like a bullet doesnt tell most of the things about tv like need to update system and allbut overall tv works fine we have inch braviasong tv contacted after this review and resolved all below issue thank u sony tvpicture and sound quality is very good its to good but in software so many bugs wifi auto connectivity issue need to connect your same wifi again and again sound setting after conecting sound bar need if we selected speaker audio system then need to use remotes to do sound adjustment in my mi tv i am using only tv remote to adjust sound and aame connectivity same soundbar unable to connect soundbar via bluetooth in mi tv same sound bar connected easlyremote size is so big so many falatu keys in remote like ro no keys fast forward keys etc and in down side blank space and aftrr software update i seen little picture quality low as compare before software updatethe tv is great at this purchase price sony tvs are generally very adaptive colour and picture qualty is really good sound is nice as well would however advise to use external speakers with a tv of such sizeif you dont wish to purchase a sound bar go for this model the picture quality is beautiful works with apple play its a win win i got the for my bedroom on a great offer and yeah its a sony a wonderful purchase absolutely worth itbest tv in its segment outstanding built quality sony tv may seem little bulky compared to some other fancy tvs but i have seen over the years that they never compromise on qualityi was little skeptical about picture clarity since it is big tv but found it better than expected sound quality is also very good for a led tv non hd channels are little less clear not bad though still it is good but its obvious seeing screen sizehas complained on tv getting struck their dealer called while i was driving requested to call visit for tv reset latertheir service manager came into conference call listened over he advised dealer to treat the service call as closed without issue being resolved and dealer service centre till date not resolved issue our tv is still getting hung sometimes and we are managing by restarting tv every timei have recently bought the inch model the picture sound quality is good it does not come with an antiglare coating do not install the tv in front of the window
3,the remote is so far good and works smoothly with a slight click no need to press too hard just a soft click required without any effort it should be better if there would be netflix prime and youtube buttons but at this price range it seems fine with me it connects through infrared rays rather than bluetooth but works absolutely fine this remote is for mi a and other similar mi models if your mi tv doesnt have bluetooth then this remote is perfect for you at this pricemake sure you put in fresh brand new batteriesbest quality give me remote is good is cheap but at the same time usefull must buyfaster delivery product quality is very good thanks nice productit works only when you are one feet away from tv doesnt serve the purposein one word it do not know the meaning of word remote
3,good asgoodbought us a backup remote for vu premium smart tv it is fully compatible the remote does not have microphone so google assistant do not workthe keys are of rubber not like the original one but not badplz dont buy very poor quality within a month buttons not working properlyworking fine as expectedbuttons are not working properly only works rest are just part of design instead go for a original one buttons are so hard to press
4,cable is working propely but the price is on a higher sidegood qualitycable was too shorthello everyonedo not go for this beacuse it says gbs transfer speed but it has a very slow speed in comparison to the original cable i got from seagate company my original cable shows the cut and copies speed to ssd like to mbs ps per second but this cable does around to mbs mostly the cable is also very thin in size the original seagate had is very thick and sturdy at the end speed mattersso if u have like or tb external hard drive it will load slowly after connecting folders keep loading and loading so i would rather suggest to please go with a gbs speed cable which will have a type c cableworth the moneyplug fits little tight to the port might damage the port on longer use but does the job wellit is a good product works with all the laptops and hard drives value for money recomended productgood
3,nice productokay product at cheap price but very high delivery charges even for prime customers quality is not great cheap plastic but does its purposeworth for money but its light weight so only for setop box stabilizers other over weights cant carrybut you cannot put big remote in its pocketnice productvalue for moneysuper product sit was sent without screws disappointed abt that but overall sturdy will update screw size shown in image
4,good built quality clear audio value for moneyi purchased this cable to connect my phone to my onkyo home theatre system as it supports only rca aux the cable quality is good and is gold plated though i have just purchased the cable so cannot comment on its durability though this comes with years warranty card hence dont anticipate any issuesgood quality product sound output is a bit low due to aux pin atleast its connected to lg tv aux outputsound is greatgood productvery good productcomes in good package value of moneygood quality cable with months limited warrantymust recommendvalue of moneyquality is superb the audio is crisp and clear a good choice to go to
4,this is my third time which purchasing a lightning cable though this is my first time iam using amazon basics lightning cable its comparatively looks more durability than other brands normally other brands are worn out with in a year and i tested product theres no flaw in charging and bending of the cableone of the cheap solution for apple usersa useful product for those wanting a longish cord lengthreasonable charging speedfeels premium the wire quality is good and overall a not bad cable would be my very next order if apple cable is too expensivewas looking for a sturdy and reliable cable for my iphone without any compromise on quality to be used in my car for apple car play this cable delivers the quality i expected and works like a charmstopped working want to claim warranty how it can be done value for money itemexcellent product

3,the mouse feature of the remote is not workingremote control with push button seems to be ok but no voice recognition and no ray pointer as in the original lg productwould like a refund for misrepresentation on the websiteyou have amended the description after my complaintbest productnumber buttons are not workingdefective product it is not working with the tvdislike the product as it doesnt have pointer optionnot working properlybest option to buy since its hard to get replacement of oled tv remote
4,everything is great i love thisvery good and working very nicefirst of all thanks to amazon for listing it as a returnable item and at an effective cost of less than kcoming to the device itself the reason for purchasing it is to experience google tv on that account the interface is more useful than the standard android tv one in terms of discovery but the listed content is not that relevanthowever it is realme that lets the user down the device was bug ridden from the beginning and they basically abandoned the device in months with the last software update in feb still riddled with bugs and never to see google tv the stick heats up enough to scald you if you touch it and it stutters like crazy after usage of over a day in part due to the lackluster a arm cores which is lacking in performance compared to a cores present in sticks from over years ago and also due to poor ram managementonly reason to get it would be for the price if it is less than k but be prepared to suffer through a laggy interface and the known issues of the remote failing within a few months still males more sense to get a fire tv stick which is more refined and receives more updates although the interface is a love or hate it onefor the google tv experience it is better to go with google tv with chrome cast but that costs a bomb in india for what it offersgot used productit was trapped and also proformance is twice degrade to fire stick also not sucking wifi well as computer to fire stick
4,quality issuegoodcable length is ok quality is not good in this price it is okvery good quality product reasonable price alsoyour cable easy to replacebest qualitygood product but thickness of cable is lessit is very good productthank you amazonsuper product
4,goodgood quality productaffordable hdmi cablenot workinggreat product the length is perfect quality is really good the built quality is also goodthe output through this cable is also very good it doesnt affect the output as much as other local cablesgreat product to buy for your pc laptop gaming stations and also projectorsgood productits still working the same after using it for monthsas per expectations hence its value for money maintain quality of picture etc
4,atlast i connected successfully working good but sound volume clarity not adequate durability to be assessed dear amazonin tell the seller to write connecting procedure clearlymanual printing also is bad i had to struggledoes what it says works well to connect two bluetooth devices to any other device like a laptop smart tv etc can take a bit of time to pair two devices but the manual in the box helpssound quality over aux cable too is good so even if you do not have a digital output or rca you can still use it bit bit flimsy and delicate but then you dont need to move it around everydaydisadvantage the sound and video lag with distance while connecting bluetooth with headphonespairing with headphones difficult need to wait longfeels volumes lowi got this to addon to a highend system which traditionally doesnt have the facility however its often requested when guests come over i was using a phoenix transreceiver but the constant need of charging and the single indicator led made it difficult to integrate into this kind of application the optical out is connected to a dual ess dac and the device used for transmission is the ipad airthis lacks a battery which is a big differentiator this means it is not exactly portable and the form factor reinforces that feature it is intended to be a desktop unit and it comes with a reasonable set of cables the quality of the included cables is quite poor so its best to use something elsecompared to the direct input from usb the overall sound is poorer with a shrunken soundstage and coarse vocals and treble still this is being used in a highend system i suspect with many lesser speakerampdacs it will be acceptable at maximum output the level is about db lower than a direct usb connection to the dacit is around the same as my signature acoustics unit which is rd the size but uses a battery and doesnt have a volume control or the bypass feature or the nice display which is handy if you are close bythe bypass is one of the highlights of this device it basically connects the two optical ports together in passthrough and allows you to use both bt and another optical sourcereceiver though only either can be used at a timethe build quality is average it is lightweight enough that a set of decent cables will tip it over backwards hence the thin cables supplied the onboard volume control is nice if a bit redundant given everybody uses their handheld or other device to control volume i use the dac remote it also has only clicks so the control will be very coarse the display has no spelling errors and while the resolution is low it is sufficient for the tasksoverall its quite expensive but is more kitted out than similar devices the sound quality limitations of bt transmission compulsory resampling and lossy compression among others cannot be overcome even with the fanciest devices and protocols so id rank it close to the top of what you can get as an addon for a hifi system for more normal usage there are cheaper options availableexcellent productbluetooth range is very lessbought it to connect my old sony blueray home theater with mi k box which does not have optical sound port it has an spdif optical port which can connect to the home theater optical in
3,everything is fine but sound quality should be little bit more enhanced after viewing the price it is also goodawesome productfm radio antenna isnt strong enough rest features are value for moneytower speakers are big but the size of this is not big sounds r good i recommend if the size was big then the sounds will better product is goodbestawesome speaker quality tooo loud speaker with clean and clear clarity fm needs to tuned but in this price no one will provide this quality of speakers single speaker beat entire home theatre or surround system

4,months review its been working fine theres been no problem as of now some thingsthe whole step tracking thing i bought it due to that reason it didnt basically satisfy me to that level with that but it does count steps accurately in the walking modeactivityits got some scratches in it but its not that noticeable at first glancethe backgrounds i believe it couldve been wayyyy better if we could change backgrounds of but we can only have customised and download from the appwhich has limited options the other backgrounds are just ehthe looks ill give it its good looking stylish differenttouch screen is goodthe sleep tracking too is kinda accuratei still havent understood it that well lolbattery life is muah i use it without bluetooth and it easily survives for daysspo and heart rate i just believe what it says as i cant check prove if thats correctthe water resistance i havent used it in water ofc am scared the calling feature works fine its got good sound overall its a decent watch and can be used in day to day activities am quite satisfied with it as my first smart watch ive used this product for days and im going to rate the various features and different aspects of this smartwatch which could help the customers here so bluetooth calling the inbuilt mic of this watch is excellent and the voice gets to the other side without any disturbance watch connects smoothly with the mobile and dont get disconnected automatically until you do it yourself through watch or phone only con is you cant silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime hope they fix it with an updatebuilt quality and looks metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting best thing is it also looks good over skinny wristspoor me with inch wrist only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guardtouch screen its almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under k i bet you will not get any laggy experience everaccuracy spo and hr has fairly decent accuracies it gives you a rough idea of your being so its quite reasonable for a watch under k count steps with decent accuracy as well sleep accuracy is also just acceptableto sum up you should definitely go for this watch if youve a budget constrained under rsi recently purchased the fire bolt phoniex watch which is quite stylish and the bluetooth calling is excellent the voice gets to the other side without any disturbancethe build quality is good over the wrists but you can get scratches on the display so protect it with some screen guard you should go for this watch if you want a budgetfriendly smartwatch under its a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls youi think you should purchase it if in future company add these two featuresi recently purchased the fire boltt phoenix watch and i am very happy with my purchase the watch is quite stylish and i get compliments every time i wear it the watch is also quite comfortable to wear and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size the watch also has a great battery life and i can go for days without having to charge it the watch also has a number of features including a step counter heart rate monitor and sleep tracker all of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health overall i am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the fire boltt phoenix watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watchthis watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money really pleased with the design and shape of watch definitely a must buy for every person loved the colour durability and accuracy is super just go for iti liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking sp heart rate measuring music player temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a ben omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome look
3,update sept boat seems to have heard the feedback and updated the watch faces now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had bit impressed added one star for itnot a very polished product the fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text the watch faces are a lazy design job no point having watch faces if only are good or usable rest are uselessupdate oct boat seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree and thanks to that they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from so overall still the smartwatch ui needs work but atleast you have good watch facesgood screen quality battery life looks and the metallic frame call clarity bt calling at the price reasonably accurate sensorsbad the ui fonts they are all very ugly and tacky they could have tried to give the chinese software some makeover but it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team a copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for min or so watch faces again a job of the design tech ui team boat doesnt have a good team of designers and ui guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch ui no option to silence a call or reply with quick replieslook for noise smart watches in the same range noise colorfit pulse go buzz is cheaper and better alternative has better watch faces and ui and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missedyou can go for boat wave call also it isnt an outright bad watch but there are better options available for the priceboat if you have a team who reads and wants to improve get some good ui and design folks in your team your products are good but the ui and design is what the people see and thats what makes them feel good about your products you have really average uiboat wave call watch is best for budgetcall is too good and sound quality is also too goodbattery is goodtotally the watch is good for rangeits good value for money smart watchlight weight touch is smoothall the features are accuratea good product in this price range must buy itgood lookinggood qualitygood product is mst haverage for calling good lookingim really happy to purchase this watch its very affordable having so many features the calling feature works really well overall if youre looking so good brand good features go for this product does not turn onplease return the item please
4,i havent used any other battery pack so will not be able to provide the exact expected performance simply put it is not divide by the battery size of your phone will be the expected cycle times if i consider this as a measure then i would say that the battery capacity is around mahhappy with the productbut its very heavyday by day battery life is reducing remaining parameters are goodslim easy to carry for travelling very good looking im very satisfied with this product overall good but it takes to hours to chargevery heavy must be about kgvery quick charge takes ages almost hrs to fully charge charged my samsung m twice once full chargedi recently purchased the mi power bank i mah and have been extremely impressed with its performance i have personally tested it with laboratory equipment and have found that it has a capacity of around mah which is very good compared to other power banks on the marketone of the things that i appreciate about the mi power bank i is that it is able to hold its charge for a long period of time i have not had to recharge it as frequently as i have had to with other power banksin terms of durability the mi power bank i has held up well over time the construction is solid and the power bank has not suffered any damage despite being carried around in my bag on a daily basisoverall i am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the mi power bank i mah and would highly recommend it to others it is a reliable and highquality power bank that delivers on its advertised capacity
4,i have been using this phone for two months according to the price range the battery backup and screen quality of the phone are good according to this range the camera is also fine if we look at the performance then it is not useless at all but it is okay i did not face any problem in calling the phone starts lagging a lot while browsing or using shopping apps if i give my opinion then this phone is good for parents if you want to buy this phone then you should compare it with poco c for now there is not much difference in the priceall is well but sim slot damageit is a very good phone on this price range good to use in day today life usehia good budget phonei bought this for office use has good battery life and basic features of android work fine however i noticed later that this is actually android go edition i dont mind using it but some features are missing which most people might not use better than nokia c which has android go edition and on website there is not mention of any update so on a budget of k you can definitely but this onenice features budget phonei like this product
4,verdict a solid buy for this price segment in and even for early there are reviews in this section review is days after purchase typos in the review has rectified now and review is days post android beta update these reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in amazon on august before oos update g only for jio was enabled via another update g is still not available in my region hence g related parameters are not covered in this reviewreview after about days of oxygen os beta update android update received on dec note after the beta update no new issues popped upie there wereno heating related issuesno fast battery drainno change in the charging timeno annoying bugsno change in camera performancebeta update is mostly like a stable updateoos android update reviewdelighters no new apps added absolutely not system storage consumption remains the same gb animations are more fluidic more customization ui features added scout widgets in home screen enlarged folder lot more daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier slight improvement in the front ambient light sensor ability to play videos in the background screen off as well even for youtube really a welcoming longing feature which other brand uis have not or only with screen off standby battery life has improved substantiallydisappointers brightness at lowest level is brighter than before no improvement in sound levels still initial is too silent no dolby atomos which was mentioned for oos perhaps to wait for stable update auto brightness latency is higher than earlier response time is tad increased haptics have become tighter than earlier but still not strongerreview verdict a good buy in this price range in note this review is after a months usage received updates during the course of time recent update was of gb system consumes gb space gb variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage n band is missing for g the unit i bought does not have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue shifting from a hz to this hz mobile no noticeable difference observed in nongaming aspect nothing great or noting worse in the unmentioned parametersthings that are delighting exceptional signal reception especially g carrier aggregation very fast download speeds insane fast charging to in mins to in mins excluding trickle charge no heating of the mobile just slight warming during charging stand by charge and sot is fantastic even more than hrs for videos yt and general tasks and calls even in mobile data always on and aod set to battery saver oxygen os color osrealme os bloatware the skin is really good nothing to complain like other brands ui absolutely no rd party bloatware and no ads in the ui or any nd party apps even some nd party apps are uninstallable no major bothering bugs noticed till date yes the alert slider is included unlike some premium oneplus modelsthings that are annoying dual ambient light sensor in rear and other in front is not well calibrated the brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required volume level is useless until level can be audible only in pindrop silence ambience audible enough only post level stereo speakers output are bottom and earpiece but full volume doesnt distort is loud enough haptics are tight but not strong even in higher levels effective only post and best only level hotspot drains battery quickly even a warning notification pops up also chrome and google app eats away battery quickly parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm though the inhand feel is good the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel the inbuild dac no mm hole and only typec port is not great the dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output perhaps dolby atmos support in oos could improve the audio outputoverall its a good mobile phone the speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long not much i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about hours on normal use not many themes available samsung is better in that sense there are many wallpapers and themes available display is clear and camera is also good overall okayi got this mobile gb gb ram variantat k after k discount on icici credit cardfor this price its a must buyi am using this product since last weeksthe camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very wellthe only complaint i can say is the battery life could have been better as a working professional it doesnt makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a dayif you have no issues with the battery section then just go for itbattery drains like any thing rest all goodi have to recharge twice a day dont buy if you want a good battery backupeven though phone is fast charge i am disappointed with battery lifei bought gb and and its working very smoothly for normal regular use you can go for itthere is problem with temper glass part front cemera area temper glass not installinggood but not so fast as i think gb its ordinary like gb apart from battery and sound quality everything else is good

4,touch screen functions well step counting is not that much accurate heart beat sensor is quite accurate but i think spo and stress measurement are not that much accuratethe watch is great for the price most things work great has great battery life as a dailywear theres not much to worry about it detects activity but that happens only after a considerable amount of time minutes one cannot change the activity detection sensitivity or timethe watch is not very intuitive to use its usually great and most features can be accessed easily but certain things take more clicks and taps than should be required in a compact device so all the features are there but it takes a bit of time to find themsleep tracking is decentphone calls have good quality people can hear your voice even if there is reasonable disturbance if you answered through your phone and now want to switch to your watch you cannot do that and you can only save at most contacts you cannot dial numbers but the mic and speaker of the watch is goodalso a confusing thing is why does the watch not have audio alarms when it is capable of producing soundwhat i need in watch is not available so dont need thiscan get it in normal watch from other brandslook and feel is awesome this is great product suggestions from amazon thanksi like the step count and heart rate accuracy not sure about stress count sometimes it shows inaccuratebluetooth connectivity needs to be improve and touch alsoall ok but anti scratch glass required in this watchgood watch go for it

4,its original price is not worth any praise so try to purchase on some card offers or other free bundles the screen is not full hd but still offers good brightness and color accuracy speaker also sounds good enough front camera is not for selfies only for video calls but back camera produces satisfactory clicks for entry level battery backup is one of the best features of this device samsung softwares are all well optimised and my only complaint in this department is the preinstalled bloatwares ui feels smooth enough and the mediatek processor coupled with gb ram is well suited for daily normal usage games are not recommended biggest disadvantage of this device is its in box charger which is only watts v a that takes about hours for a decent charge heating issues during use with in minutes usestouch screen issues some times its too great and some time u have to touch several times even on samsung key pad while typingwe all family are using samsung mobiles but this time i worried of issues if i have to face same issues i have to change mobile and transfer data its very irritating work i wish to if any one of samsung is reading this review please reply me through amazon मनट म उपयग क दरन हटग क समसयटच सकरन कभकभ जर करत ह यह बहत बढय ह और कभकभ आपक टइप करत समय समसग कज पड पर भ कई बर सपरश करन पडत हहम सभ परवर समसग मबइल क उपयग कर रह ह लकन इस बर म मदद स चतत ह अगर मझ समन मदद क समन करन पडत ह त मझ मबइल बदलन हग और डट टरसफर करन हग यह बहत परशन करन वल कम ह अगर कई समसग इस समकष क पढ रह ह त कपय मझ अमजन क मधयम स उततर द bought for mom as she just want to use for calls she is not a selfie or video persondidnt want to go for realmexiaomiredmipoco products because of their support this already comes with android and two year updates are assuredthe display is really good not full hd screen though call quality is goodi wanted a smaller size but unfortunately the price doesnt fall under for themif you are buying for lots of photosvideos this is not the phone for youif you want to use for call do basic things like whatsapp and other things this would be a good phone for youthis phone was bought for a first time smartphone user it was a good fit for the said user thank you samsung and amazonnormal phone with very average screen quality battery backup also not very good but yes its worth it thumbs up under this budgetsamsung m exlent mobile battery and screen best qualityrejonabule pricemidle class best of mobilebetter price with discount performing wellan affordable mobile from a premium company

3,good quality does not make sound a bit less stronger for heavier mobilesits having good adhesion and suction power during my last few months of usage i remounted this once due to broken windshield for different reason adhesive was good even after remounting during my months of usage once it came out on its own and i remounted its usually i park my car in both direct sunlight as well as in closed parking area i am not sure it came out due to hot glass but never faced that again also mostly i use this mount with arms extended to it maximum length arms are stable during the vibration of car due to bad roads but one small con i felt is arms in full legth is bit shacking but its stable if i try to move it it could have been better but thats not problem for me as longs as it serves the purposegood product value for moneygood one worth for moneyhave been using for almost months not sure on the durability although this looks of good build going good for now it is sturdy and does the good job i believe is worth the moneyokthanks to all for wirting a review which helped me buy this product absolutely perfect suction is good quality and overall product looks perfectgood product in this price can buy it
4,samsung offers super fast charging at wattjust a joke wherever other brands are offering full charge before an hour providing heavy chargers samsung is notsecondly samsung is offering c to c chargingyou need to carry your charger alwaysyou can not charge your phone with some other c type cablethirdly this device responds only with its own charger you cant charge it with other c type chargergood enough if you want to get some juice in a short time samsung could include the cablesamsung should provide charger with their boxsuper fast charging quickly charged my mobilei baught this adapter for my new google pixel a but it was not packed i received the adapter in open and broken box i checked the adapter quality serial number and matched with the box so it is genuineperformance is good but its very huge almost triple to conventional charger difficult during trips but charging wise no issues at allgreat but little hot the mobilethis adapter has c type socket which is like the charging cable socket in our mobile so you need to buy a c type c type charging wire

4,i would not consider buying an iphone simply because my friend owns two of them or blindly go for a new android model suggested by my son or nephew both of whom are more tech savvy than me because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations which may differ from mine i am an oldfashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres megapixels and megabytes but i think of a cellphone as a utility item not a status symbol applying a technocratic approach i would not choose a costlier option unless i get additional features which suit my requirementsmy foremost requirement which is entirely nonnegotiable is that my handset must have provision for two sim cards since i do not want to carry two separate handsets for my cug and personal numbers my other requirements are not difficult to fulfil a phonebook with at least contacts basic net connectivity a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous whatsapp and my favourite word games which do not need much memory or processing capacity i would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability software and security updates and high battery capacity sufficient for hours or preferably hours at my normal level of usage besides i would like to use a new handset for at least two yearsapart from exigencies i do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the internet videoconferencing or sending emails as i prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activitiesi am equally clear about what i do not need i do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies reading books listening to music or creating fancy social media posts nor do i want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as i would prefer to use a camera at the risk of sounding flippant i would say that i do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf primarily because i do not own a car and i do not play golfhaving used smartphones of samsung and motorola makes over the past few years i vastly prefer the former my last phone which gave me over months of good service was a samsung m since that model is obsolete now i focused on its upgraded cousins m m and m the last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two sim cards along with an sd card after studying the relative specifications of m and m i concluded that the latter offers better value for money generally it is worth going for the higher memory and higher ram versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small with these considerations i narrowed down my choice to m with gb ram and gb storage just twenty years ago i was using a desktop with gb memoryas a confirmation for my choice i compared the phone i had selected with oneplus nord ce gb ram gb storage which my son had recommended the specification of the samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters except that the display screen technology was tft instead of amoled i also watched some youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features the clinching factor was that the samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the oneplus productas for body colour my first choice was emerald brown but i settled for the mystique green since the former was not available in my selected configuration i was thinking this would be irrelevant since i use a case which completely encloses the handset but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phonedespite a strong family resemblance with my old one m the new phone m offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly it is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone but these differences are acceptable to me thanks to the mp front camera and mp selfie camera the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about metres from the stage this phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates which reduces the worries on these fronts youtube reviewers complain that the m has plain looks it is heavy its audio does not offer an immersive listening experience and its screen is plain old tft instead of amoled i am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings so long as the m meets my requirementsi was glad to find that samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers because old chargers like old handsets add to ewaste however it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers the recommended charger for m is watts but the chargers i had at home are rated at or wattsto cut a long story short i ordered a watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time after using the new handset for a couple of weeks i find that my phone is at charge at the end of the day and it takes minutes for complete charging one of the useful features of m is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging it turns out that i could have managed with the old watt charger except that it would have taken minutes for full chargingi conclude by emphasizing that samsung galaxy m g is the perfect phone but for my requirements a word of advice if you are planning to buy a new phone it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to usewith g connectivity a hz display and solid performance the galaxy m g is samsungs bestvalue smartphone yet under k segmentpros almost half the price of galaxy aexynos is a solid performerexcellent hz display with smooth experience across the boardhuge

reasonable for price segment but we have seen faster charging speeds with other oemspromised major android os updates and years security updates is a huge plus above its competitors making this device more value for money in long runcons ultrawide camera is on softer side lacks details compared to its primary sensor but manages to frame good shots that one can post on social media macro camera is good with colors and edge detection but lacks depth of field and details note pro which is brilliant in this casenight shots are above average mostly grainy and muddled but better than most smartphones in its segmentlacks some stability in video recording at k amoled display could have made it unbeatablelacks stereo speaker but audio quality on single speaker is quite goodpreinstalled bloatwares like moj dailyhunt sharechat byjus are mild and uninstallable but makes mature one ui experience looks immature out of the boxcurrently device is not tunned for high gaming performance as limited fps in popular games like bgmi and cod deters it away from being a gamer friendly device but we can expect exynos to resolve over time and be more optimized for more games in future updatesslightly cheap design chunky in size carries some heft dated notch displaylack of charger in the box is a bummer which adds up to the value cost proposition
4,i am not big on camera usage personally i was even mentally prepared for a bad camera based on some reviews here but i was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos they are not awesome but they are decent photos that can even be sharednow coming to my biggest grouse heating issue the phone started heating up while charging but it was just a little and so i could have ignored it but then it started heating up more and got me very concerned i even ordered a replacement thinking i got a defective piece but then after further tests i found that it is heating more when i download huge amounts of data for example when i restore data of my old phone from back up this is ok with me as i dont perform huge data loads regularly definitely not on phone then i tested by running tasks i usually perform such as checking office mails attending office meeting on phone watching a video from amazon prime and so on the phone did not heat up even a little personally this is good for meat this price range this is a good phone but if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently this phone may not for you i am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage i will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already i am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you or not in terms of camera and heating i had many questions about these aspects before buying perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy or avoid cheersdisplay beautycamera decentperformance amazingbattery ok in mah u expect more tbhoverall good phonealso after day of use i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim which im using right now in this phone but ill keep update this review after month of usageits a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me weight of the phone too many procedure to change some settings no screen casting apart from that it has good touch a decent camera for day light battery life is goodi bought this smartphone for my mom samusung interface is very handful for easy use battery is superb last whole day camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures all in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for unable to do video call within same service provider as in volte within same service provider video call feature is availableproduct is fine nothing fancy but for the budget it is a good phonebattery more than enough for normal use not sure in gamingcamera good in this segment can record videos in fhd fpsdisplay since its a lcd display the quality is a bit less but goodv ram you can add upto gb of virtual ram but have to sacrifice your storage space to use it overall a good budget phonefinger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good
4,received the product today the packing was intact though i found watch not at its proper place it fell down inside the box and found the inner holding box damaged also not expecting any kind of tampering but thought to share the product packaging overall nice product will share detailed review once use it for atleast a weekgood watch through fire boulti am impressed for this watch is so computableand all features are properly working like mean feature voice calling are properly working andthis price range are no any brand are give this feature i am happy for this watchthank you fire boultpros the phone supports both phone and apps calling has long charge phone finder phone camera shutter are good features beautiful looking watchcons not a full screen display display is smaller than the watch my watch is not center alligned limited number of watch face sometimes tends to call on recent number with false touch phone book should be a little larger than numbersjust bought it so my review is basically the first impressioni will write a detailed review after few days of use i like the style and it looks good so far touch operation is also goodits good product in this range because i have one more of pebble smart watch in same price range but after using fire boltt its better only one issue that not stop call ring during office or meeting timei liked everything except hearbeat and o level accuracy but its close to real levels so average in this respect otherwise its a kill for the money very good overallthe product is good as per the price charged one feedback to supplier to improve the glass of watch there are lots of scratches within one month of usageall is good satisfied auto selection of sport mode is not there you have to select each sport mode for each workout
4,this is my first g iqoo mobile purchased on th december at amazon till now i didnt feel anything bad in this mobile happy with the purchase camera quality is good it works smoothly in all the optionsthis is good performance handset but the quality of the camera is not good even though they said its a mp camera its doesnt take that sharp picture so youre not thinking about camera its a good choice for this much amount its also have a problem with gjio connectivitytouch not goodnagood phone but camera quality is not good enough but proccessor are greatvery nicebudget mein sabse mast phonecamera quality is not up to the expectations
4,if you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media this is a very good option for you i bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose this has only gb of ram so dont think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also wont run very smooth under above normal conditions there is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash but the battery is mah and has considerably high battery life there is no fast charging only normal charger is given so in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social mediathis is worth for price has the latest technical softwares and perform well for minimal usage ofcourse it has configuration less so we should not look better than thisbattery life more than expected we could buy for this budget rangesimple and good ok cameraokoverall good quality productgood unitgoodgood mobile for basic users
4,like quick data transfer dislike geting hot itself in minutes and let other pendrives getting hot alsoproduct built quality transfer speed all good small in size so easy hold and carry anywhere but the bill i received nothing is visible on itnot charge fastnot looks w chargercable are goodwelli purchased it to copy stuff from my phone to usb and vice versa it works well for that purpose the fitting is perfect and no connection issues productworking fine
4,today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart i was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchpros amoled display is very bright and nice look and design is premium bluetooth calling is awesome speaker is loud and clear even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch calculator features is useful multi functional crown button is easy and useful easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only mb but sufficient to store around songs approx song sound quality is also fine strap quality is good and soft tws connecting features is also nicecons sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day fingerprints are clearly visible on screen glass i have attached the pic for ithealth tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price rangei have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different accurate only ai voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phonesometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker which is quite irritatingthis must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for rs including bank offer for this price range overall its a good premium watch its my experience with this watch for just a one dayrest how it work for long run that dependsrecieved a damaged device at first slight gap between display and body from the left side but quickly recieved the replacement next daythe replacement was goodamazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just hours so great job amazonalso i live in bangalore so the experience might vary from place to placeprossmooth enough uifairly accurate readings on all the sensorsheartrate bp and spocall quality is great for the price good speakers and good micyou can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch and it is seamlessdisplay is great colors are punchy and bezels are good enough not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s max but still good enoughbuild quality is good but does not feel very premium it does feel like a below k watchso you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch strap is not too long as every review mentions strap is good enough not too comfyi ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazingui looks much better in person than reviews ui is smooth and looks good not as good as realme watch probut still good for the priceoverall its a good watch for the price of around k kanymore and it is not worth the pricerealme watch pro is the best at around this price so if you get that in stock and for below k then get realme watch proor else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under kconscall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reasonwhich is onesteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walkingso dont rely on step counterbattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling maybe around daysbut otherwise battery stays for over daysblutooth range is not too good and varies from watch to watch and also phone to phone i get a decent bluetooth range of around ft but this is more of a fact than a coni write this review after week of using this watch bp bpm spo running and sleep tracking functions are working well watch speaker is also loud and clear to you and the other callers the only con is when you want to listen to songs through a watch from a mobile its bluetooth disconnects automatically again and again as this fund is not useful for me so ignore it overall its a good watcheverything is absolutely greta in this smartwatchbut these things could have been better watch faces you should have the option to add upto watch faces at once from the app rather than one at a time and preinstalled ones app ui could have been better dnd mode absent no option to toggle bluetooth always onbefore review i would like to appreciate this great strategy to pour out honest reviews from users by giving them bookmyshow voucheri loved the touch screen experience amoled screen of the watch it gives a feel of premium watch the band of the watch is average doesnt look premium i separately ordered a metal band i am expecting mobile app improvement from fireboltt as i dont find it good enough if i compare it with boats app for its watches as i own a boat smartwatch rest visionary is a good buy worth the money the only thing which physically is not appealing is the average quality of the band
4,please add app gallery when we do right to left swap on home screen because right to left swap or left to right swap have same pages it should ring instead of vibrate in alarm or you can give it optional depends on user the temperature doesnt sync fast i have to go in the noisefit app again and again and do it on and off in weather settings to sync feels like jugad all these things can be fix from updates so pls try to do itthe watch looks cool and works very well but the sensors are not the most accurate it shows that i am up to ½ hour every night when i am not also the heart rate is generally higher than what it actually is and the calories burnt are lower the pedometer is more or less accuratenice one only bp monitor is missingi like this producti liked the watch very muchi m happygood featuresgood

3,i bought this product with the hope that it would be a good and stable selfie stick but it didnt help at all it is not suitable for large phones like iphone pro max very clumsy and the tripod doesnt stand at all keeps sliding had a very difficult time to set up the selfie stick pros useful stick stable only till half length after that it shakes like crap bluetooth remote is given which is very very useful infact necessary i would saycons useful only till half opened after that it shakes like anythinglacks a mount to mount any led flashlight for low light videos biggest con cost of batteries is more than the selfie stick itself now as i have no money for going for a gimble so i am using this as well as bought spare batteries costed me rupees for batteries although i must say that you can find the cr v battery the one used in this one much cheaper than what i paid on either local ecom website or local shopsone must have this tripod to get full family picturethe quality is upto the markand it is standing strongly with weight of phonebluetooth control is quick and clearif you are taking photos with your family at home then it is good but if you are a single rider and ride solo then its length is normal you will get only half of your photo it should be of such length that the rider can take a complete picture with his riding gearsthen it is good for the riders my suggestion is that it should be more lengtheverything is perfect except if you pull the tripod to a long hightsuperbgood at alli havent used it much product is good its neat and clean remote works well the part where phone keeps thats too hard to open and it needs to be more sturdy
4,i like itgreat phone in smaller amount these camera amazing and display very smoothly playmobile is good but amazon very low service very productvalue for money product very nicesometimes fingerprint sensor is not working properly camera quality is good battery life is best overall it is a good product review added after month of usebest phone in this range except battery life
3,i bought this phone after tonnes of research and watching and reading several youtube videos and blog reviews of multiple phones my budget was around k max and this one somehow fit in all ways i had almost finalized one plus nord ce but changed my mind at the last moment and i dont regret ive used redmi phones before so im aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer got this for k with close to k exchange on my one year old tecno spark phone one of the worst phones ive ever used refer to my tecno spark review for that heres my review of this phone based on months of usagepros build quality is good finishing and lookwise its sleek and quite comfortable in hand back camera is really good better with the ai camera the mp gives good pictures although not comparable to iphone or google pixel quality but for the price range its not bad portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions decent in low light with night mode w charger is very efficient phone gets fully charged within mins from below battery levels battery backup is decent with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more dolby atmos dual speakers are really good you could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers pretty loud too no lagging and smooth touch refresh rate is pretty good unlike some of the earlier redmi phones or chinese phones in general there are negligible auto installing bloatwares android performance so far has been satisfactory hasslefree usage in general something that i struggled with a lot with my earlier techno spark phone for basic functionalitiescons front camera couldve been a lot better in daylight conditions picture colors arent vibrant enough and in low light pictures come grainy dissatisfied with that amoled display isnt as good as i had expected especially becomes evident when light reflects on the screen while youre watching somethingnothing else worth mentioning that i can think of right now may update this review if anything encounteredfor people with k budget looking for a good overall usage phone having g this phone is worth a shot along with nord ce litenice phone with good battery backupfast charging sturdy body and good process speed camera quality is not good enoughbut overall good budget phone battery is decent charging is very fast camera is averagingoverall nice productthe phone is good from all aspects bug if ur looking for a good camera this is not the onethe price of the product is higher at the time of launch within month it dropped by kthe price qty is oksome features are missing which are available in chinese make modelpros displaysuper amoled battery life hrs moderate usage fast charging hz refresh rate work seamlesslycons miuilots of unnecessary appsprocessorsd is too oldmain camera not up to the markoverall i just want to say if youre looking for a phone to watch movies and series and casual gaming go for itpubg cod feels fantastic in this without any lagif looking for heavy gaming or looking for a camera phone this one is not for you brothergood phone need improvement in camerathis mobile has the best camera compared with other models
4,not charge like original my brother have same charger which is comes with note box his charger charge without heating and fast and this is not charging as originalgot great discount nice productplease be aware while buying the original samsung w charger there are many sellers on this link that sell a fake onepls check and buy from apparition retail for best productpls see the pic on the right is the same product from another seller for lesser the package was damaged and open the charger only charges as fast charging and not super fast charging the print on the adapter should be in gold font originalthe packing text etc is almost exact pls be careful as this can damage the mobilethe final one from appario was original does super fast charge as directed good charger and reliablegoodit works fine the solidness is worth it me satisfiedfast charging as mentionedi am happy with the purchase please note that this charger head doesnt come with the cable cable needs to be purchased separately i already had a compatible cable so i purchased just the charger headvalue for money
4,despite being affordable these headphones are pretty good i use them mostly for talking on the phone the sound quality is crisp and clear though for serious music listening i think other more expensive headphones will be betterworth to buy sound is also good delivery was so fast the headphones are awesome sound quality is goodcalling is also nicebut i like most of this earphone its softness thanks to realme and amazoneit was good and delivered at the timehighly recommended
4,i ordered this phone based on specs it was providing later i saw flood of negative reviews coming up on amazon which made me test few of things that was mentioned if it was true calls getting disconnected i had call with my brother last night and we talked for min and call did not disconnect in the middle heating issue while in day to day use never faced heating issue but it gets a little hot while charging i can understand because of massive fast charging which is understandable every phone with fast charging heats a little camera quality it has a decent mp samsung camera module which is justified at price it comes you can judge the camera based on how well it performs indoor with artificial lighting conditions and this has done good attached pic of cake which i clicked indoor only bright light source was candle it performed well i can sayto people who complaint about camera i just cannot expect picture clarity of apple or samsung high end devices i have to set my expectations right for the price we have paid antutu benchmark score while company claim of while i tested i got a score of i again cannot complaint here because i dont know what was the testing conditions and criteria that company had followed while testing is pretty decent score i can say phone lag in two days of testing it has not lagged at all with multiple background apps running battery drain revisit few of the settings on your device like animation transition effect etc to get most out of your battery if your batter is set of monstor mode set it to normal or battery saver to make most again battery depends of usage of individual and i cannot blame company while i started to write this review my cell phone was at now its almost min typing till now its now showing i have set my screen at full brightness i fell its decent also tested charging speed to in min build quality its sturdy and decent plastic is used i can say at this price point they should have provided glass build but again considering all price benefit you have got while buying this phone no complaint card discount exchange benefit etc still i would take out star here black colour issue did not face any problem with screen leak or black colour its amoled screen black is highlight of amoled in case you were using ips fhd panel on your previous phone you will have trouble distinguishing i have samsung m as secondary device and i see black similar on both bgmi i played few rounds yesterday and did not face any frame drop or lag two year warranty they calaimed to provide two year warranty on this device but during registration it shows only year i have personally wrote to iqoo team and amazon team seeking an answer with screenshots waiting for answerbtw majority of phone manufacturers provide year warranty only even iphone here i would say fight for you justice and seek answer from iqoo or amazon team video call lag did not face any did multiple video calls yesterday with different people did not get any complaint from them about my video lag for all of them my video popped up instantaneousoverall i would say i had a great buy and can recommend this device to others for all the folks bombarding negative reviews i would say first set your expectations right and you will be satisfied in case even still you are facing problem then you have every right to complaint and get justiceoverall i give this device a star as of now since i am yet to test this device long term like months or monthsplease excuse any typos or grammatical errors if any entire review was typed on my phone iqoo neo i have been using a budget phone realme since dynamic black gbgb it served me well but it was time for an upgrade i was looking for a midrange model this time that would have almost everything i wanted within my budget did i get one lets dig into itthe good price after discounts i got a phone with practically all the features i wanted iqoo is basically from vivo an internationally recognized brand hopefully i dont have to worry about software updates for at least years iqoo is already doing good as i have received security updates so far for the android that came out of the box i will keep an eye on the security updates and os upgrades as it will make me decide whether to go for vivoiqoo for my next phone dual g sim support which is futuristic with g the call quality has been superb so far e amoled hz nits peak x pixels display with contrast ratio hz touch sampling rate and hdr netflix hdr supported a huge upgrade from my previous phone the photos ott movies look too good easier to read contents like messages emails or documents mp main cam with ois ois was a musthave feature for me since i could be taking a lot of lowlight photos mah battery with w flashcharge technology in min in min works as claimed the battery life has been satisfactory sd cpu not one of the flagship processors today but highly capable and fantastic at this price inclusion of gb ram has made this phone a butterysmooth one for running apps android is quite a ram dependent os unlike ios up to gb of phone storage can be used for extended ram currently i have apps installed mostly productivity apps but no gaming apps the cascade cooling system seems to be working gb rom with ufs since phones nowadays tend to ditch a dedicated microsdxc slot and this phone is no exception i did not want the gb variant a fast large internal rom is better than an external card as the latter loads the apps files slower the indisplay fingerprint reader works well the stereo speakers are reasonably good infrared port ir blaster i have not tried using it as a remote but a must try usbc port with usbc to usba data cable that connects to the phone charger some of us prefer a usbc to usbc data cable instead as it is more friendly to the modern devices but i can see why iqoo decided to provide a usbc to usba most laptops still come with usba ports even my recent hp g laptop from the company i work for does have a usbc port without power delivery and two usba ports my powerbanks dont have usbc ports either screenshots lock screen virtual buttons must as using physical buttons frequently for these functions can potentially damage the buttonsthe bad google backup a fail since i did not have a usbc to usbc cable i had to choose the wifi data transfer option from my old phone to this one although i selected all the files google failed to transfer many files especially the pdfs dear google this is unacceptable spam handling my realme lets me block any sms i want but this one does not in my opinion every modern phone must have a native app that can identify the caller and help block a number or an sms as needed i have stopped using a rd party app like truecaller which has become a truly rogue app no mm jack a plus when you dont have a bluetooth earphone or dont prefer one but iqoo thankfully included a usbc to mm adapter in the box the absence of gorilla glass protection is not a good thing but i do not mind as i barely drop my phone and the phone came with an already applied tempered glass screen protector and a transparent back cover really appreciated the plastic body does not bother me moreover the dark nova color feels cool ymmv in my realme and not in my realme c which means it is a custom feature from realme for specific os versions if i try turning off the daily wakeup alarm it gives me options like turn off on the next day for which the alarm is active do not repeat any more or cancel this is a fabulous feature as it allows me to turn off the alarm for a particular day say an upcoming leave or holiday without turning it off for the following days unfortunately this artificial intelligence is not available in my iqoo neo galways buy a recently released model if you are going for an android phone this will make sure that you get software support for long enough time moreover avoid buying the variant with lowest ramrom and fast charging is a necessity as you see that you are hooked up with your phone all the timei have used this phone for months and will update this review as i keep using it till date i am quite satisfied with iqoo neo g i also liked the funtouch os and recommend it to anybody who has needs like me

4,the earphones have good clear sound quality it lacks base battery backup is good anc is a myth in this earphone it might hurt your ear if you wear it for longer duration depending on the shape of your eareat easily fit in ears and light weight and sound quality is good too over all its worth to by this samsung buds ita connects well to the samsung mobile toobought this solely due to its form factor to try how samsung has made them to sound in this open bud style to be true samsung has managed excellently to give us an unique twsthis is not an inear style tws but resembles somewhat earbud style tws only of its kind in the market as far as my knowledge goesthey are held very good in my ears gives me a good seal and does not fall out strange as i cant use earbuds because they fall out frequently it seems that samsung has finalised the shape after a good homework however it doesnt mean that it will fit everybody as there are many dissatisfied users around the globethe finish build and all such generic factors are top notch the size of the buds and the case is very smallnow about the sound if the buds fit in ones ears with a good seal the sound is full bodied but if the seal is not perfect it may be tinnythe sound signature is very bassy for my taste and i have to eq it to my taste the bass is so pounding that sometimes it becomes difficult to get a taste of the treble i listen it in treble boost mode adjusted through the app anc works strangely and noise reduction is not very decipherable in contrary anc on somewhat opens up the sound dont buy this for ancstrangely to me these buds sound better on my iphone mini than my galaxy s spotify and apple music the buds have app support for both android galaxy wear and ios galaxy buds live but the android app is more feature packed and works better the ios app couldnt update the firmware although there is a menu in the app and always showed the device to be on latest firmware however as soon as i connected with my s on pairing the first thing it did was to update the firmwarei love these buds solely for their form factor and they are pretty good for k against an mrp of k the do sound very good but does not suit my taste persons loving bass may love them dont get them for anc battery consumption not yet fully tested but seems ok it has wireless charging too if your ears are too small or too large than normal better not to buy as they may either not go in the ears or will fit loose giving a improper sealbest call quality noise cancelling could have been improved to best but still wotks gooddescent battery lifemusic is good not to that top notch but good in this segmentoverall worth for buying with good call quality a very little to compromise but goodi am using this for like months it is a good and productive if you are in the samsung ecosystem if you are not a part then do not buy it its not worth its pricebluetooth range is not that goodthe sound quality is extremely good for a tws and the sound signature is almost flat i got these for rs it almost felt like a steal deal for me until i faced one cardinal flaw in the design of these buds the bluetooth antenna has an absymal performance it feels like i am using bluetooth v the range is so poor that even if you put the phone in the pocket the audio starts stuttering the mic quality is a hit or miss inside the house it works very well but outside it performs poorly i think it has more to do with poor antenna design than the microphones quality if you are thinking that maybe the faulty product is an exception then do a google search about its range issue and you will find hundreds of people complaining about the same thing samsung has poorly implemented the design and is reluctant to admit its fault i pity those who bought it at around k for such a flawed product even at rs k it is not worth it because of the range issue it is better to buy a wired iem atleast it will sound better than thisin this price samsung brand is goodeasy to wear and good battery backuphardly support the meter bluetooth connectivity
4,very nice product and easy to use as well as very soft to cablein picture shows as nos but in cover only noseasy to attach with usb cable bought total pieces in rs loved it quality productso far ok will hold the wire connecting after the usb joints but couldnt stop it from bendingdont even think of buying this by just looking at the cheap price of this product as it has been made by cheap quality plastic which can not protect your cables as it is not at all sturdy so please dont buyonly two packs camethe product is cool value for money love it
3,so about the product boom ultima as it goes by the name it really got the ultimate bass effect wires are great built and tangle free the audio jack is compatible with almost all devices and its gold plated as well i just didnt find the case it was missing from my product though they have given pairs of extra buds with different sizes overall its a great wired in mic earphones go ahead and add to your cart you wont regret itso first lets talk about the externalbulid quality is awesome even at such an affordable pricelooksi have all colours of these earphones and all colours looks coolwirethe wire quality is i have these earphones from months and these havent tangled since also the rubber coating and the inside braided wires gives a nice looking effectbut thing i have seen is the middle piece which have a mic and buttons is degree reversed so many times its difficult to pick the right or left earphone without seeing but it is mentioned on the earphones so that becomes easynow about the main part the internalsthe sound quality is so so nice as you can see in my title solid you can listen any music like lofi or peacefull type and when its time for a party you can listen rock bass boosted songs with such a adorable quality its the true definition for true sound and at cheap pricesbass quality is also goodperfect for the ears and if u want high bass i tried it with max bass it can produce and thats awesome but dont listen high bass for long those can hurt ur ears really badbut noice cancellation is seems like there is no noice cancellation maybe its mentioned for the mic not for the earpieceobviously there are very high quality products then this product but those will alteast cost but i will choose this product instead of a one or less than because this cost less than or sometimes less than depends on sale but quality and services of these products are not less than of a rs earphonein past of my earphone died but the coustmer care is so generous there services are so cool and quick so those got replaced within days its days because i forgot the eslip if you mail them with everting ready it wont take more than working daysits an honest review by me and i will definitely suggest you to but these editedtheir services are slower now dont know why and it takes around week to weeks to get the refund if something happens to ur earphonesalso its been like year as of and i saw some trend with it my brother earphones stop producing sound from one side evey months or sobut mine earphones be with me for monthsits not a problem though cause you can mail em regarding this this happened with me even with extra proper care of the earphonestill the best earphones you can find at this price pointnot for high bass loverseverything was ok but as shown in the picture that you will get a case along with earphoneswhich was not there inside itonly earphone and some earplucks were therethis range very good productif your budget under definitely you can bye this productnice productproduct is good but the accessories like the pouch is not provided as mentioned in the description in the second delivery also despite the return of first delivery of the product for replacement with pouchproduct is good but needs to work on noise cancellation
4,i am using oneplus r gb gb more than one month it is my first ever oneplus phone my personal review about this phone is as underpros boxy design looks nice but feels not so premium but if you use its cover it feels nice cover quality is very nice screen is bright even in sunlight if you select auto brightness also screen color and touch response feels premium battery life is very impressive with day backup with normal use watt charger is very fast which charge your phone within to minutes i am not a heavy gamer but i tried asfalt which runs very smoothi think itll play heavy games smoothly so it perform well i am new to use oxygen os i feels os premium and smooth without adds rear camera shots very good pictures but selfie camera need some improvement which i think can be done via software update no heating issue lightweightcons if you use without case it doesnt feel like premium phone i dont like the sound quality although is has dual speaker you can feel vibration on its back pannel which feels very bad selfie camera needs improvement zoom is very bad on rear camera no ip certification no expendable storage paid theme store should have some dot notch animations like samsung at last i can say it is a nice phone with some cons if you want oneplus smartphone within rs you can go for itterrific purchase at the price of k body i feel light htough it is not as usual oneplus body as i had been the user of one plus in past also metallic sides could be a better option sometimes i feel lag in touch though it is for microseconds but it is there camera quality is good not awesome battery life is good i used to charge once and a day can be completed by itm obviously i bought it as it is one of the affordable option in terms of brand love to see metallic frames in coming phones storage is tremendous and speed is also good m overall a good purchase a phone can be rated out of this smart phone is good enough for daily normal use but battery life is not good enough though is says mah camera quality is not good enough in this price segment although its oxygen os it is not well optimised from the starting there will be some lagging issue with some apps another bad thing about this smart phone is its form factor the company taking around k but giving just a plastic body which will looks like below k if someone wants to buy this i suggest to buy another model dont go for this model because of the brand one good thing is oneplus promised three major android update and four years security update another bad thing its primary camera design one of the three camera is so big that its embracing to say its price is ki would like to get directly to the pros and conspros battery the first and the best thing about this phone is the damn battery life and how fast it charges its just amazing and i have been kind of spoilt by it now i wont be able to adjust with a lesser battery performance and charging anymore camera the camera is amazing and takes some really amazing pictures no complains looks the phone looks really beautiful i got the forest green colour and it looks simply awesome and is eye catching and premium lookingcons the overall working of the phone is not as seamless as it should be provided the hardware it boasts of having said that the factor cannot be a purchase deterrent its otherwise quite smooth the absence of an alert slider was a disappointed i was used to it on my tvolume not too happy with the phone speakers they somehow are not up to the markto sum it up just go for it if you have a tight budget but want a premium looking good performing phone it packs too much for a k phone good battery fastest charging in the segment premium looks good performanceusing the phone after two days i have noticed weird experience with ui tapping on grey or black areas screen flickers to that portion and according to service centre its common issue across all phones and getting fixed by oxygen update as there were no issue with proso we have to do nothing but to wait for releasing the new os update on the r and other models as welloverall device working good so far i experienced average camera resultssuperb charging but not so extended battery life touch sensor and speakers are fine and performance is good in my day to day tasks hopefully ui and os updates will help to deliver best of this phoneover all camera is just ammazing i am a youtuber purpuse behind choosing this device is its processer dimencity max its a supersaft max performence not even capturing while gaming also its runs very smoothly and its my first premium smartphone im the uploded photosx zoom lg pic and i have uploded night and day liting pics to comparegood device from one plusits speaker is not really working well using it since months only plus it dosent comes with a warrenty plan it has to be brought separate camera quality is also okay not thattt good microphone is also been disturbing a lot while talking on the call other side person gets a lot of disturbance
4,the stands quality is decent beacuse of its compact size and various folding angles it widens the usage according to the user highly recommended for students one side is slightly tiltedgood product good grip sturdy product fullfill the need overall very good product given gift to friendsgoodquality is goodbuilt quality goodexcellent product
4,i am very happy after using it this power bank is very good i have seen a video on youtube with an amazing rating before buying it enjoyed buying itgood product value for moneyesme ek choti torch jaisi light add karke thoda price badha den to mast raho over all a great product but i have faced a problem while charging the power bank with my mi w charger it never accept quick charge and sometimes takes more than hours to chargewhile with macbook pro charger it accepts quick charge that green lighti bought a separate charger for this power bankgood i like itpower bank is good the only issue was the cable which came with it broke after a day of use and also damaged power port of phonejust good as expected compact size came with a premium good packing need see how it performance with mah u can charge devices at a time but good for a single charge of mah mobile they have given one usb a type to c type cable if you have another c type cable with that u can charge another device i like the carrying pouch they providedi didnt got any pouch with this power bank
3,worth every penny compared to the cost a basic bluetooth band that support only single device at a time call voice us clear and microphone does a decent job of noise cancellationdont expect good base treble in this the rubber ear piece is not tight enough even with the large ones and keeps slipping away the magnet is also weak and doesnt connect smoothlyi had ordered my first ear phone from ptron only and to tell the truth it is very difficult to get such a good quality earphone phone at such a low price best earphones in such a low price you will not regret the money you have spent if you buy thisit is a good productynicebuilt quality is lil bit cheap but sound quality is superp comparing to other grand companies like jbl sony senheizer bass is moderate noise cancelling needs to be improved my overall rating is stargoodgood quality
4,i bought this powerbank to use during my vacation with family it is sturdy but a bit on heavier side can charge three phones at a time if you use the two usb and third type c port as well for charging the speed of charging is alright and appropriate the one and only drawback i experienced is the weight of the powerbank itself without this limitation it could be really amazing product to buybit heavy but does its job takes tooooooo much time to charge whatever mention in the description is not correct at all with regards to the powerbank chargingi needed an extra power bank with a larger capacity so this time i thought to give ambrane a try as i already have honor mi power banks mah ones though it was not a perfect match for mi or honor ones iit did live up to my expectations for the k range inside box powerbank microusb cable carry pouch depends on which package you received more below user manualwarranty card general leaflet feedback leaflet some details mfg october charging time hrs min via w charger low battery indication to full charge backup was able to charge redmi note pros mah battery times with regular usage in between pros high capacity power bank with dual input micro usb or usb c dual output via usb ports not a fast chargequick charge device but has an output of va w which is good enough touch button for power checks or switch it on for charging device it comes with a carry pouch more below on this part compact form factor sturdy design with abs body cons it does not autostart charging when the device is connected since it has a touch button instead of pushbutton it activates accidentally switching it on every time during handling there is a lot of conversion loss backup is slightly less for a mah power bank cons are significant enough to reduce star there is scope for improvement points in this product in the same range so device led status stndrdth led blinking while charging power bank status of charge in terms of no of leds blinking leds solid white while charging other devices status of remaining battery in terms of no of leds one blinking while charging other devices low battery all led solid glow battery fully charged ambrane box debate when i first received this power bank it came in a small box approx xxcm mfg aug with everything forced in congested space the issue i had in this one was that it came with open seal no poly wrap around product box as if it was a used product or was tampered in between so was skeptical about the authenticity of the product and ordered a replacement right away this one had usb c cable but no carry pouch when replacement came it came in a polywrapped bigger box xx cm mfg oct with an outer sleeve and main box inside with a hologram seal maybe ambrane changed the packaging the hologram seal here was intact but was also not applied properly to secure the opening looked like it was applied with an open box so its presence was useless this one came with micro usb cable and a carry pouch carry pouch as per my analysis carry pouch comes with the latest october lot which comes in a bigger box and was unavailable in earlier lot with a small box carry pouch size was appropriate for power bank and i had no trouble inserting power bank in it some users reported it having a smaller opening but i had no trouble with it and found it to be a proper fit neither loose nor tight its soft nylon meshed pouch and is a nice addon verdict at the price point its not a bad deal its a midway path bw low quality and highquality ones you can very well go for ambrane as it makes good quality durable power banks rest nothing is perfect in this world for this thing only days replacement policy from amazon and year warranty from ambrame is available if one can extend the budget by a few hundred mi power bank will be a better option with a metallic body better quality overall i have mi honor ambrane power bank and their overall rating will be from low to high ambrane honor mii am putting up this review after day of usage this is the second power bank i have bought from ambrane india overall third power bank for my family before to this i have bought their pp mah model and also has mi i mah power bank both were really good here i am putting together all the pros and cons which i am able to find after day of usage and also a little bit of comparison my dad uses redmi note my mom has mi a and i am using redmi note pros dual input type c and micro usb this is the foremost and primary reason of choosing this power bank over mi or other brands as you dont need to carry two cables if your phone has type c input which in my family out of has the same easy to carry and hold as it is very compact is size i must say in comparison to mi or ambrane pp solid and sturdy built mah capacity with same lithium polymer batteries these are safer then lithium ion batteries this i came to know while buying this product cheaper price than mi touch button at the top to know the power status this is something unique it took less than hour to charge my redmi note from to at cell battery indicator which is pretty good and almost equivalent to my wall charger best part same time and charging speed in delhi metro i dont know either it is pro or con both of my other power banks supports qualcomm quick charge technology while this power bank supports only fast charging at amp but i feel this has charged my phone better and faster than mi power bank itself i know a phone must also supports quick charge technology for fast charging but when i use quick charge on my dads redmi note which supports qc either from mi power bank or ambrane pp power bank it kind of heats up the phone also it fluctuates the power and automatically switches between quick charge and fast charging which affects your battery life so it is safer to charge the phone at optimum current at ampcons very stuffy packaging it looks like the power bank has been forced fully stuffed inside the box it has some adhesive tape at the top i dont know why which when you remove it puts scratches on the top be careful while removing the same no torch light their pp have it only micro cable inside the boxdefinitely heavy but i knew this i will recommend this as it has slots so we can charge two phonesnice productpower backup is good but the usb cable provided is very bad it stopped working after few months of usageeverything is good but the battery dont last that long when use for charging two device
4,review overviewaveragethe boat today launched the boat xtend the companys latest budget smartwatch with a price tag of rs the boat xtend smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the apple watch moreover it has builtin amazon alexa support spo tracking stress tracking and much more coming in a budget segment is it worth it should you buy this smartwatch if you too have such queries then there is nothing to worry about it is a detailed review of boat xtend smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about itcontentsbox contentdesign build comfortdisplaywatch ui and featuresalexa supportwatch facesboat wave appaccuracybatteryfinal wordsbuy nowbox contentboat xtend box contentsmartwatch in blackgold colourcharging clipuser manual and warranty carddesign build comfortwhen buying a smartwatch one always thinks about its design and look apart from features design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch the boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look the design is inspired by the apple watch but it cannot be compared to that obviously in every aspect apple watch would be much better than the boat xtend smartwatch redmi watch as well as amazfit bip u pro has the same shape and design but the build quality is much premium on this oneboat xtend design and buildi personally dont like the color scheme of this boat xtend smartwatch the black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame i believe the gold color would fade away after some time there are three other color variants which also dont look stylish as this one however that is my personal opinion on the color scheme so maybe you might find the color scheme to be goodboat xtend designthe watch has atm water resistance it has silicon straps which are quite comfortable the straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usagedisplaycoming to the display the watch has a mm square shape display what you see on this one is a tft panel the screen has big bezels however the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off so you wont notice the bezels and the screen quality wont feel cheap at all it doesnt have an alwayson display but we cannot complain about that the watch offers a screen on time of up to seconds and up to levels of brightness controlboat xtend display qualityi find the display quality of the boat xtend smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from boat view angle is good on this one and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight the color on this one is not very saturated but this isnt something that we can complain about in this price rangewatch ui and featuresthe ui of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use there is a single button on the watch which works as the poweroff button as well as the back button moreover the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem there isnt much animation on the bar menu and the navigation is simple so you wont find it difficult to use however the watch may lag a bit the company has done costcutting in terms of the processor thats why you may find it to lag a bit but it is ok and not a big deal at the price point you get itboat xtend uithe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity which includes total steps walked calories burnt and time heart rate sleep tracking stress tracking breath training spo training meditation find my phone and music control apart from that there are different support modes on this watch i tried a few of them and they worked fine the watch notifies you of the incoming calls messages received and various other notifications in detailboat xtend smartwatch reviewalexa supportthe main highlight of the boat xtend is the amazon alexa support the watch has an inbuilt microphone and you can access it by longpressing the back button do note that you can only do some basic tasks with alexa on the watch like setting an alarm setting a timer and such well it is a good thing to have alexa on a watch but you wont find it very useful probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement and then you wont prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks so even if boat missed this feature it wont be a problemboat xtend alexa supportwatch facesthe next cool thing about this boat smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one you get more than watch faces on the watch and probably more watch faces will be added to it moreover you can also set a custom watch face as wellboat xtend watch facesboat wave appyou will have to download the boat wave app to use the watch the app is available for both android as well as ios devices you wont be seeing bugs on the app and it works perfectly i havent noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection the interface of the boat wave is clean and simple you will get all the fitnessrelated options and all the watch settings on the app itselfboat xtend boat wave appaccuracyaccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch so talking about the accuracy i tested everything on this watch from normal walking to running sleeping and much more and i find the results to be accurateboat xtend accuracy testcompared to realme or redmi watch the result was the same on all of them so there is no problem with the accuracy i dont find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers but yes this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking sleep tracking and everything it doesboat xtend accuracycomparing it to the noise watch which we tried recently the stress level as well as the spo tracking is much more accurate on this one it also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in womenboat xtend accuracybatteryyou get to see a mah battery on this one which the company claims to last days however if you use most of the features of the watch then the battery will last about two and a half days if you keep the brightness low then the battery will last about days i find the battery life to be a downside of the watch it comes with magnet hook charging supportfinal wordsboat xtend smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the boat it offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker a good display alexa support good design and build and much more the smartwatch at this price is quite good personally what i didnt like about this smartwatch is its color scheme however if you like the color scheme then i would recommend you to go for it overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life the battery life on this one is quite low the company claims it to have a battery life of days but with regular usage it will last for days if you are looking for a good smartwatch under rs and you can adjust with the battery life and you like the color scheme then i would recommend you to go for this smartwatch it offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under rspros premium build quality with matte finishing sturdy polycarbonate frame good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch attractive trendy colours heart rate except heart rate spikes in weight training pedometersteps counter are accurate but spo is off by when compared to pulse oximeter readings but most smart watches offer the same accuracy sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time wake up time duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate light deep sleep waking detected but no rem sleep detected sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with boat wave app issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces large clear bright sharp lcd ips display even in the sun touch not smooth experienced jitters ui also lags at times after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require taps to work but acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically in app gps works superbly excellent route tracking on the map this feature is not advertised in their description bluetooth connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximitym the boat wave app must remain running in the background at all times definitely splash proof though didnt take the risk of submerging the watch all notifications are working no problem with call alerts or sms msgs or social media app notifications no lags at all though there is provision for a sec lag which can be turned on alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker info is displayed on the screen my wipro smart bulb firetv stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt alexa on the watch alexa can do mathematical calculations currency conversions even foreign language translations apart from supplying info on anything under the sun but ofcourse alexa cannot make calls alexa can set alarm timer also sedentary alert drinking water reminder stress alert menstrual cycle alert alarms timers function well boat wave app connects easily no lags observed data syncs smoothly with google fit app excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges but settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective training sports modes r good guided breathing mode is also good find my phone works well extremely stylish light weight comfortable for all day wear watch faces available in the device with preset which cannot be deleted the rest can be changed from the boat wave appcons lacks vibration intensity control lacks camera control shutter but cant figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands gestures to click pics no quick reply messages for notificationscall alerts no call acceptance or silencing feature a work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time spo is not accurate and sometimes freezes at but this is common in all smart watches battery doesnt last more than days if continuous hr measurement is turned on otherwise easily lasts for days watch faces are very childish expected better quality designs company can easily improve on this in their next update amazon prime only replacement no refund policy is not good at least colour change should be allowed once music control feature does not display the title of the song no bp monitoring or temperature monitoring feature smart watches usually do not provide reliable bp data no calling feature but it doesnt matter as most dont want conversations to be public a bit large for narrow wrists band mm is a bit wide company should provide a tempered glass protector no mention of protective glass on the display mentioned have attached a scot tempered glass purchased separately there are actually only sports modes boat has bloated the list with indooroutdoor combi of sports walking running swimming cycling there is no light sensor auto brightness is only time dependant but works wellwas a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour the evergreen classic goldblack overall the best smart watch with alexa built in available at the budget price point of under rs an excellent fitness tracker but average health monitorplz add calling feature with thisotherwise it is okgoodits little expensive but okkk
4,item is good no issues it supports mobile which have great charging inbuilt featurecharging is good but cable quality not goodgoodif your smartphone doesnt support more than w fast charging then this will cover it for you i would suggest getting a different cable if you want something with more length but the standard cable it comes with is pretty solid no cheap feeling whatsoeverpretty good charger for any mobile device provided that the device supports w fast charging and usb type c portofcourse it is wi would like to suggest this to all of them who are subjected to irreparable in box charger especially redmi note pro usersvery good productbought this to charge my mi a mobileeven though the mi a has a lower amps and voltage rating than this charger upon research i found that a mobile communicates with the charger and only requests the required amps and voltage from itand this has proven to be right as my mobile is perfectly charging with this chargeryou wont find this good of a charger and cable combo for this price
4,it is good for data cablesi liked it basically its good product with good quality but this product is overpriced because same product from different brand are selling at or more less money still i bought this because of the brand namegud quality and packaging but slightly expensive this for my mobile charging cable its useful for not to brake the cable
4,i was looking for a phone below k i am not a person who believes to burn money for phones my requirement was a phone that has good network reception good wifi reception a balanced software good battery life good screen that dont strain eyes a good hardware mm headphone jack and a charger i dont need g network because g drains battery a lot and g spends too much data i dont watch movie or yt on mobile network and i wonder how many does watch fhd k k videos over mobile network for downloading documents social networks banking apps g is more than enoughin my budget i found all phones have gb ram realme narzo was during gif and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was redmi note but i found that if i can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer i can get a redmi note with gb ram at gb ram is always preferred over gb ram because nobody knows whether with future updates the os would demand more ram or not also the softwares may require more ram as time passes away so this was the only option i knew then availableredmi note has amoled display i am not bothered with hz hzhz i keep the refresh rate at hz and display works without zero lag or stutter all my desktop screen has hz refresh rate and i am happy with them so why do i need a hz screen i think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers the display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich you can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but i think standard is fine for me also you can calibrate display colours in settings but i think you dont need that display size is inch it could have been better if it were inch i prefer big display phone redmi note has that big display a plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and i am happy with that the screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth the screen has a punch hole camera which looks goodthis phone duel speakers one is more powerful at bottom and another on top but i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or yt bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good what more do you expect from such tiny speakersthe phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience i can say my phone and wifi modem stays at different floor still i get good signal and never disconnected voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear however because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phonethe phone has mah battery and comes with w charger which is a bonus at this price point the battery gives long backup with good mobile network you can use it for days without charging using basic features like phone sms email fb wa etc but i charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below the phone has sd processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag the experience is butter smooth however the apps get automatically cleared from ram which i like because i dont have to clear ram manually however after android update the ram hold app for longer time but eventually cleared sd doesnt heat up and it is very energy efficient because of that battery drains very little and w charger charges phone within mins for my usage the cable is usb a to c and feels goodthis phone has ir blaster so in your home office you can control ac or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailablethis phone has ddrx ram and ufs storage the ram is gb and can be expanded additional gb as virtual ram by occupying storage but i have disabled that option from settings because it increases ssd life this has sim sd card slot which is a great both sim have volte and carrier aggregationthe phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive some people may complain about plastic but remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones and i have no problem with plastic i dont think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap i am happy with plastic back the phone also gives a tpu cover and the cover however yellowing after i month this is inherent chemistry of tpu and no one can prevent this chemical degradation how ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlightthe fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly the touch screen is excellent toohowever i dont like some of the preinstalled apps some can be uninstalled a few cant especially mi pay and getapps from mi store i dont like them however i like the pre installed security app there is no ad in notification and all can be easily disabled camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good does not show pictures like mp camera i have added some pictures clicked by redmi note back camera miui is fluid and has many user friendliness like oneui miui is now free of bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the userso i give redmi a score of this is an excellent phone the i got at during great indian festival i recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone this phone is not for gamers or people who watch k k videos or shoot such things this is not or those who are crazy for g otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment days usage good battery life bqest for dayday use w charger also good best display but shouldve hz instead of sturdy inhand feel stereo speaker is loud and crisp split camera above average but good concerning the price buggy uiminor as expected but ui all way better than bloody miui g chipset sd which is fine g always available some minor issue with wifi reception dont know may be they will fix it through ota this phone is for people who clicks photos here there casual gamer binge watchers of web showsmovies not intended for heavy gamingnot for pubg cod loversthe first look of this starbust design is eye catchyno word to express its designin hand feel and and its all physical dimension the second this which impress me its battery backupeven you playing game hardly for a long timeit gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also w is also a good deal at this price the third impressive factor is its dual speakeri have an another phone of k and the sound quality is almost same as it media playback experience is also enhanced by its amoled display very colour charming display literally the display quality is unbeatable the camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience other performance like gaming is also good at this price point fingerprint button is also very responsive all other things and features are good to the price pointonly one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower gradeeven my old redmi y which i exchanged with this had better camera than this so plz i request you to all dont buy this for camerajust dont the images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to mei dont recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phoneif you are non camera user then you will surely go for itpros design inhand feel battery and charging amoled displaydual speakercons cameraquite a smooth daily driver phone the overall experience has been satisfactory cameras good durability also seems to be good ive dropped it quite a few times the gorilla glass seems to be holding up hz feels great charging speed is good too nothing mindblowing though battery life is decent lasts quite a bit but since i keep it in the hz mode all the time its a little less for me but i dont have any problem with battery life for nowit does what the description sayscamera quality not upto the mark compared to other redmi mobiles even a model clicks better picsfinger print sensor is same as that of the lock button you need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint readvolume is good for both call and streamingfast charging but charger gets heated soonbattery back up is good unless you dont do heavy gaming and all day video sreamingdual app and dual space option is missinglight weight and good video resolutionoverall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography gamingi bought this for my dad and its working good for him if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good phone for elders or first time smartphone userphone is good but i facing weird bugs due to software issues after that i manually installed latest global software then working finewhen i was using indian firmware after the update the phone got into bootloop every sec but after manual installation its working fine

4,the camera is good phone is quite respponsive fast chargingthere are some niggling software issues and do not forget password pin there is no way you will be able to get it back to factory settingsthis is my second iqoo z pro and my humble advice to all the users and purchasers out there is that please do not update your device to the latest software version doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues i speak from my experience my first iqoo z pro gb is updated to the latest august security patch update and drains battery at the rate of percentage overnight for no specific reason the idle drain is very pronounced however my second iqoo z pro which i purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain so i think its best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issueabove average performanceno heating issuefastest fingerprint readerface unloakgood battery lifeok camera qualitylight weightcomfortable on handall the features of this mobile was goodno doubtly anyone can buy this but nor for gameswithinh the budget only it was available for medual tone flash light is not working i think its only single led lighttwo things missing pin hole camera earphones jackoverall camera excellent but battery life not good maximum hoursas this price limit its a good mobile with camera battery screen quality

4,pros really like the stylus it works fine using it from last two months excellent for note taking tip quality is good doesnt wearing off extra tips provided it provides all the functions which are mentioned charges quickly response time is really fastconsfew times it automatically turned off while using but not a big concern as it happens rarelynot for professional sketching and drawing as it is clearly mentioned that it doesnt support pressure featuresconclusion for price under k i think it is the best stylusi am using it with ipad air didnt face any issues till now so dont know how helpful customer care support isso the quality of packaging and product quality is pretty good ive seen it turn off in just seconds a couple of times but thats all by the way i ordered it for my old ipad pro inch a as i dont want to buy new apple pencil at full price and i somehow couldnt find the right alternative for st gen apple pencil either but i found some questions here answering it works for a after delivery i found out it actually wont work and then magically the right model of stylus was on my amazon home screen when i wanted to return this gonna order a new one which kingone says works with a lets seevery good product build quality is aluminium so feels premium working is good as well best for note taking and basic operations budget friendly full recharge is completed in mins affordable price wish double tap gesture as at the apple pencil nd genease of use accurate all is good upto now and also looks good feels good feels premium product at this price deserves stargood productwhile using it automatically offs itself this happen when it is in use but worth buying than a expensive apple pencil

4,this review is based on my two days of usage work fine on activity and fitness tracking but sometimes software does misbehave need some improvement on the software and not work only with bluetooth connect it requires an internet connection for sync and sometimes bluetooth does not fully work i believe problems which are coming may be solved by the next software updates entry label smartwatch with calling features wise oki only have one problem sometimes it acts as a speaker and all the sounds of whatever that is playing on phone comes from the watch also i would like to know if i can silent the ringtone coming from the watch is there any way please help i am using iphone the product is really good it feels so light during workouts its so comfortable to wear and the reason i gave stars is that the sound quality is not so greatgood looking and two things are missing female health cyclebelt strap was very smallscreen touch is very smooth and u can give some lengthy strapover all and gps also missingthis watch is good at this price range as compared to other smartwatches but it has delayed in wake up wrists feature overall good look good performance good quality and affordable price nice texture of this watch it is light in weight very comfortable to wear
3,just a watch not smart one all features are to make fool of youworst watch connecting problem with phone nd automatically disconnecting from phonevery good quality of product and price is very lowvery goodভল ঘড টdislikeafter use of months observed battery life is getting only one day max with only normal usage with out audiook for regular usagesuperb

4,the sound quality is excellent for the price and so are the three buttons however the material quality isnt good and the wite breaks after months or soless bass good sound quality might be betteri like to buy this headphonesgood product very much i like you good sound quality good its really very nice product thank you so much samsung galaxyi have tried many wired earphones almost every brand but this is just perfect mids and lows are superb treble and bass are balanced well the remote has buttons mic works well during the call not so good not so badlike but
4,its a good purchase for long term personally i like it because it came with install kits and costed me around and trust me its very easy to installand its protected the device for a fall of bed to ground overall nice product its very nicei saw a video on youtube and got to know that the best way to apply this is as soon as you remove the paper which comes along the phone hence you can easily avoid dust particles it worked well with me im happybut scratch resistance capabilities have to be checked yetbut its also a bit pricy for glassneed to wait and check its life span and protection qualityafter putting lots of screen protectors i found this was the easiest no need to think about alignment as the alignment tray makes it a breeze i found two big air bubbles after installation but those were removed very easily with the squeege tool overall the process took hardly mins just clean the screen properly before installing to avoid any dust mark below screen protectorgood and easy to installits easy to install quality is great doesnt cause issues with camera and is better than the original screen itself in terms of touch feeloleophobic coating on it is really good ive been using it since over months now and its not faded at all its a bit expensive but it keeps phones screen looking new and shiny and it is much much better than the cheap ones in doing so its night and day differencefit and finish is really good too applying it is super easyotherwise i dont see it protecting the phone screen from cracking or scratching more than the cheaper or the more expensive onesi recommend getting this over others primarily because itll keep your expensive phone looking newthe product is good easy to install and comes with a wonderful package but its too costly rs k if u happen to get this for a discount or deal then go for itthis screen protector is super quick and easy to install all the tools and institutions provided makes it a breeze

4,a bucks piece can save cable worth hundreds totally recommendi just received it and applied on my iphone related cables and connectors specially apple accessories are not that sturdy and doesnt last long due to breakage at the end points due to wear and tearthis seems to be a very good and low cost investment to protect all of such cables to break due to usage and weartear have applied in earphones also will be watching over the period if time if it indeed increases the cables lifetill now feeling good about this useful productprice is highyou can go for thisit is useful after using it the durability of the cable is goodvery good product it definitely protect your cableit doesnt really protect your cable if the cable is starting to wear out you need to use this before the cable starts wearing out it works only if the cable is thick enough but overall good qualitygood

3,overall it is nice phone at this price go for ittbh its a good phone for your parents of you are a heavy user then dont consider this phonecons slow charging this phone usually takes around hours for full charge in initial days you will be impressed by the battery consumption ie it runs days after only charging once but after few days it comes back to normal you will not get features like slow motion etc etc in this price range you can get these feature on other phone or mi variantsthis is my days reviewhence i havent tried every feature of the phonewill come back soon after using it for monthsextentawesome phone recommend to buy itits all okay g phone in cheap price
3,the watch is good the app is very bad no google fit integration or anything watch face is barely customisable i dont know why they used the new noise fit prime app with it the app is very glitchyif you want this watch for calling go for it otherwise dont i hope they make this watch compatible with actual noise appalso wrist awake does not work properlyon the plus side it is good for callingit is great for the price range i bought it for my son and he is very happy can pair with a phone and make and receive calls nice ui great watch faces step count looks to be fairly accurate all in all a good buyjust work like a smart watchits very light weight with all the added features battery life is max dayit drains your phone charge rapidlynicelike very muchnicecomfort and nice to see
4,this works by clamping on to ac vent it holds on sturdily minor block on ac flow is not of much consequencethe phone clamp is spring loaded and accommodates all phone sizesmost holders working on suction does not hold onto glass they fall off while driving could lead to accidentsgood product but didnt work for me as it was unable to hold my moto g devices weight the clamp mechanism was great i loved it but the back clip which goes inside the ac vent was loose and kept on moving also the lock which tightens the back clip was averagereceived today the product is of good build quality it gives a feel of premium product not used it so cant say about functinalityproduct is good but fitment in ac vent with mobile phone placed on the holder increases weight which is not desirablegood quality in this price range it will however block your ac vent easy to mount and unmount your phone quite sturdy although not perfect has been able to maintain its composure even on bad roads will post the long term review after a few months but so far so goodgoodnice producti am satisfied with my product

4,i got it for and i guess for this price its good enough dont buy if you are buying it for than this price if you just wanna try out a smart watch this is really nice but if you are expecting too many features in it then go for a pricier one at least for this watch u dont have too many features and you have to use your phone to set up most of the things like alerts and notifications do not disturb mode and even alarms tooother than that its touch response is pretty decent has got nice watch faces you can make your own as well and battery is long lasting at least for my usage lasts more than daysalso notice that the wrist isnt black its dark grey but the dial is blackthis item is best quality the price is very worthable this products overall quality is quite good i will recommend to purchase this itemthe design of this watch is really good i got this at in amazon sale and its really value for money super lookscreen refresh rate is bit low but a great product for this price best product
4,camera great no words for its outstanding performance at price of rs it can even beat smartphones upto rs in camera departmentbattery for min charging gets discharged used for quora twitter pininterestfor min dischargedused for upto mb gaming appsso decent batteryremember display being amoled full hd with high ppi consumes more batterygenerally battery stays one and a half day if used throughout the day without gamingdisplay very colourful being amoled but only once i saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display but that was only once i hope it doesnt occur againedit it happened because i removed some permissions from system apps it never happened againtip try to keep brightness low prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid ghosting screen burns in far future in amoled display of all samsung mobilesheating i can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time but its not muchwant to know how much heat i feel well it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low batteryperformance no issue as others are making it out to be you can play many games its just not smooth in heavy games in daily usage it doesnt lagi have used sd before this has mtk g so near about it gives the same performance as that of sd or we can even say it gives a little better performance and is comparable to sd i didnt play heavy games on this phone but i did play games of about gb on my previous phone which had sd so i think those games will work here without lag as welltip just because some people got defective piece doesnt mean you will too and if you do see any manufacturing defect then you can always place a replacement

4,good one display is good battery life is very good camera quality is good for me finger printer placement is not good cant be used with both handsusing it from last months now battery backup is good camera is good and in this price range this is one of the good option as of nowthe best phone in k i have purchased in sep but on dec my mobile stolen during this period i have used hrs in a day continuesly but theres no lag problem battery life is good the speaker is not good i think in this mobile there is one problem i facephone runs amazing with the dimensity and i only have praise for the performancehz refresh rate is eye opening coming from a hz phonebuild is pretty solid and the back has a nice texture that doesnt build up fingerprints muchredmi has packed the phone with some neat features such as the ir blaster and the surprisingly amazing dac which redmi didnt even flex about in the marketing my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smhincluded phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housingsonly complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid doesnt look very amazing but nothing to complain about either hmhmcannot comment on camera quality as i am a pleb who doesnt know how to nitpick at camera quality pincluded screen protector is reaally bad its only been under a month and there are already scratches around the lower screen where id be typing so highly recommend peeling it off and taking your chances with the gorilla glass or just getting something aftermarketoverall strongly recommend if youre into a solidly built phone that focuses on getting stuff done rather than sitting around and looking prettygoodif you buy phone for camera purpose then dont buy this but overall average mobile under this price battery backup very good and changing time apx minutes for to goodits a good product for normal daily usecamera quality is not up to the markoverall a good product
4,linking the smart watch to my mobile phone was not as seamless as is to be expected for such a product once it was set up it works flawlessly however the noise smartwatch app on my google does not give any data on sleep cycles and neither is there any information on how to transfer the data to another useful app such a google fitnoise pulsemax smart watch is awesome and looks goodonly one default battery life days is coming with notificationswithout notifications it is coming upto dayspackaging was not proper the package having full of oil in the package but the brand packaging was proper so no issues with the productafter using more than months the product is really impressive and having good battery life and accuracy and the quality of calls on smartwatch are the bestive been using the product for a while now and i gotta say i love it the battery lasts around days not days you do get around day battery life if you disable almost all the features of the watch like heartrate sensing and not connecting it with your phone the watch requires more software support and they should add more watch facesnice product value for money totally good productthe calling feature at such a price point is definitely a plus the health features are a bit not upto the mark but manageable the screen is responsive but a bit low res
4,ok with charging looks very sturdy and durableone amazing cable for bucksfast charging upto watts m in length and really durablebought it like the th time passed down my older cables to family members all still in working stategreat product wanted this as my portable battery has usb slot and ipad and kindle reader have usbc ports fits my requirement perfectly charges very fasti bought it in and it almost last three years post heavy usage gonna buy it again very good qualitygood quality usb c charging cable that enables fast charging for samsung m as well as m g w seeking phones metre cable length helpful in keeping phone on desk while charging adaptor plugged into electric outlet best value similar m cable costs x or x in retail market this is best pricegoodvery good overall
4,good quality works well it shows warp charge on phone when charging start only coz the charging is a bit slower about than the originalvalue for moneygood but not like originalover all good product decent buyvery good productvalue for moneythis cable i bought in july end and in december mid it stopped working not durable and not value for money for rs of cable lasted hardly for monthsoriginal one plus type c cable cost around rs so went to have a decent one but received this product with almost same as original i will write once i start using this for a while but my first impression on this product is good it supports warp charge w looks steady good built
4,i really like this product gifted to my sister and she likes itgreat good productnice thik haiin this price range its ok productcolor so nicei loved itneed some more features
4,the sensors has burnt at two point of more than mm dia on my wrist upon wearing overnight and i have abandoned using it out of fear had enclosed photos herewithworst to buy its belt quality is totally poor performance is average not proper tracing of activities and battery life is too averagevalue for moneyits goodlow batter lifenice smartwatch big display long battery life max featuresgoodgood product
3,i really suprise there is no bluetooth calling and no gpsalthough brand is good but if there is bluetooth and gps it will be extra good for buyerspleas add bluthooth calling so your watch selling will increaseits a premium build watch with mid range features it needs a lot of software updates to fix bugs and bad design choices i returned the watch after a days use because the features didnt warrant the price i was paying for itthe same notification appears twice in the watchnotifications that i have cleared from my phone dont go away from the watch and it even vibrates randomly showing the old notificationswhen i want to clear a notification i have to swipe to the left for the delete icon to appear and then tap on the delete icon why the extra step why not just consider swiping left as a removal of notificationscalls on the watch only have the reject button there is no button to accept the call from the watchgoogle fit sync doesnt workyou can only store watch faces at a time also the variety of watchfaces isnt a lot which is probably understandable because it just releasedwith a couple of software updates this would be a really competitive watch hopefully they dont abandon it like they abandoned updating the oneplus watch watch at price i have used city bank credit card for availing discountthe functions are super smooth although the nhealth app sometimes does not track exercise overall the watch is great productplz update and add call receiving option
3,only issue ive had is battery liferest it is a great productvery nice watchnice touchoknicegood productbattery back up need to be improved remaining all features are goodai is not working properlywatch is good but i had battery issue and alarm issues

4,nicey packed easy to install and with good quality adhesive perfectly fit on the screenits a well made basic screen protector application can be tricky as it comes with no aligner but the protection it offers is goodregards to durability to scratcheshabe to wait and seeobserved the finger print recognition is affected a bit as it take an extra couple of tries to register the finger printall in all a well made economical basic screen protectorthe tempered is nice and easy to install the adhesion could be bettera good product at this price rangebetter than other costly tempered glassfeels premium touch sensitivity is goodwith a little fear i purchased this item for my new pixel to my surprise it perfectly fits the phone and even i was able to stick it without any bubbles even the touch reponse and finger print are working flawlessly there is no guide to help you stick the screen guard which is okay as we all know how to do it i recommend this product over the overpriced branded screen guards but yes i am not sure how it acts in a drop and i am scared to test it but it feels like it will protect the phone display during an accidental dropdoes the job thats it
3,overall it is nice phone at this price go for ittbh its a good phone for your parents of you are a heavy user then dont consider this phonecons slow charging this phone usually takes around hours for full charge in initial days you will be impressed by the battery consumption ie it runs days after only charging once but after few days it comes back to normal you will not get features like slow motion etc etc in this price range you can get these feature on other phone or mi variantsthis is my days reviewhence i havent tried every feature of the phonewill come back soon after using it for monthsnillextentawesome phone recommend to buy itits all okay
4,perfect for a inch tablet both vertically and horizontallyit was the best phone holderpremium quality and reasonable price goodfulfil purpose easy to carry solid material think it will last longniceliked the product easy to carry portable foldable lightweightgood
4,quite firm and steady i wish they used a little metal or hard fiber for this like bobo company holders but great product at this pricegood product and good qualitystud should be provided to fasten the rear screweverything is good but it suppose to have a locking system bcoz anyone can remove easily at parking areasvalue for moneyquality is goodi wish there was a proper instructions manual other than on the box but its not hard to figure out the product is amazing it is sturdy and steady even on bad roads the phone is completely safe buy this product without thinking twice i loved the product so much that i have to order one more because my family members need one tooavarage quality
4,pros very sturdy and stable not easily knocked down by kids no fear of falling overmobile holder stand is very flexible easy degree rotationmobile holder also pretty tight very safe to keep the mobilethe adjustable clamp is wide enough to suit any width you can fix it on very slim or thick surfaces holds welleasy to assemble according to the instructions given on the websiteoverall very satisfyingcons a bit tight when it comes to the gooseneck clamp so quick adjustments to length may not be possible while watching but that adds to the sturdiness so thats okaythe mobile holder also is a bit tight to insert the phone and remove but again you neednt fear about the mobile loosening and falling offfor the price it is the best its hard but without hardness it cannot withhold a weight of tabletso the the hardness makes sensenot bad its okaysvery nice product bro value for money but you ask the store in this product how much other ways the quality and material are goodbetter for streaming videos because if you fit your phone in this and then touch it then it moves due to the weight of phone or use this for any work where you dont have to touch your phone frequently such as video calling or voice calling etc otherwise its goodvery useful for students for their online study aslo useful for movie loversusing for kindle on bed quite sturdy and good clamp length of wire should have been slightly more by inches which will enable user to hold the mobile kindle at a good distancethe length is not great but the product is perfect for its prize and solves the purpos using it as a bed armworks well enough it isnt really stable and tend to vibrate and shake when holding tablet and some heavier phonesalso i can only hold phone horizontally that means it gonna block charging ports and speakers
4,good quality tempered glass best part is these guys are extremely prompt in customer service and warranty issuesproduct quality good but over priced also there is a small gaps from the edge but can be ignoredi got two screen guards for pro pro max installed only the one on the pro ive been used to fixing screen guards for multiple types of phones from multiple brand screen guards my honest review after the installation i really liked how easy the installation was the coverage of the screen guard across the entire screen the finish of the product once installed hope to put an update after a period of time on how the screen guard coped with my rough use goodthe product came well packed is durable infact much better than other organisations who try to sell you same stuff with inflated pricing the product stays on for long and has all the qualities to be called a top producti recently purchased a screen guard for my smartphone and i am extremely happy with my purchase the screen guard was easy to install and it fits my phone perfectly it has provided excellent protection for my phones screen and has prevented any scratches or damage the screen guard is made of highquality material and it is very durable i highly recommend this screen guard to anyone who wants to protect their phones screen it is a great value for the price and it has exceeded my expectations overall i am very satisfied with my purchase and i will definitely be purchasing from this company again in the futurequality of the glass is good have been using it from last two months the scratch resistant coating works finei had issues with initial application of screen guard i phone xs and then i contacted customer support to get it resolved they immediately responded back and the issue got resolved i am very much happy with the purchase and i am planning to get another one for my samsung m g
3,lital bit okgood design but china productit changes the angle and gets loose in a few days onlyvery poor qualityits worth and good qualityvery good qualityi like the quality of the phone holder its amazing
4,i used this mobile last months overall very good i am very satisfied buying this and no lag no heat you can go for itnice phone looking good and over all good for this pricegoodeverything is good but the voice of recorded call is very lowfentastikgood but brightness level is naturally low in this phone brandgudit lags and hangs a lot and there are too many ads and inbuilt functions in the phone which are very annoying
4,the product is handy and really feels good to hold it supports fast chargingit takes around to hours to fully charged itthe only down side is that it just has outputs usb and another usb cit is good is if you want a budget power bank but maximum it last up to charges in apple pro max the charging is super fast the disadvantage is it take so long to get rechargedgud product lightweight considering k charge but slow charge i have a fast charging phone and doesnt charge fast enough lightweight easy to carry charges fast too overall gud got at discount of rs satisfiedit is not fast charging to my mobile one plus nord initial review post month usagecharging time more than hours with fast charging power cable power adaptercharging phone can charge a phone timestested with mah batteryleds utter waste so mild that it cannot be seen from a distancethis power bank truly delivers as mentioned i was able to charge my t phone times fully with still some charging left in power bank it took around hours to charge my phone completely absolutely amazing product at offered price you can go for this one also tried dual feature ie charging power bank at same time charging phone and it works well no problem did not face any problem with power bank heating issue while charging phone or itself type c charging port for power bank is good so you dont have to carry two different cables and type a usb cables are hard to findfew cons what i felt after using charging cable provided along is of no use it does not support fast charging hence used fast charging cable for both charging phone pw bank leds is of no use from a few feet distance as they r so mild to be seen from a distance you will have to hold pb very near to actually see leds although not a deal breaker but definitely star deducted due to this bulky very bulky definitely cannot be carried in a pocket not a deal breaker againthis powerbank is the daddy of them all considering the amount of juice packed into it its form factor is manageable it holds a whopping k mah of charge can reverse charge another powerbank it charged up a k power bank from in around min while it dropped from led indicators indicating the quartile of charge left in the device is very useful ive not yet had to even once struggle to charge the device as even with heavy usage daily i barely drop to before i recharge it it retains charge very well too solid buy you literally have a generator in your pocketworth for moneycharging is fast supplied with usb to c cable onlyc to c cable and adaptor are required to use the another charging discharging port hence additional cable adoptor are to be purchased separatelyother manufacturers supply along with c to c cable even with lesser cost
4,liked top notch display gorgeous display heavyly and seriously powerful device thanks to gen tremendous battery life in heavy usage super cool device silky buttery experience with blazing fast performance good sound quality the form factor is really good i mean the screen is flat so it feels like a widenot actually wide but feels like phone also it is tall thats why it really feels good at hand i have an ipad but all the work now can be done by phone so i am happydidnt like it as i had opt i loved oxygen os but now it feels like realme ui camera is worst for this price main sensor is good other two are useless company should provide a telephoto lens in this price range i had opt and previously optboth camera were good opt camera is exactly same as nord tconclusion if you looking for speed performance battery life longevity best of display premium feel then go for itif you are looking for op experience like an alert slider or a good camera then please dont choose this either u can wait for the next op or go for other devices if you dont bother about ui experienceie oxygen then go for iqootits far better in specgo to gsmarena compare opr and opt exactly same specification except processor and charging speedthis much fast charge is not required by excluding important spec i am oneplus user since their st phone i have used oneplus oneplus nord nord ce nord t and now t i have been using t as my primary phone since last month everytime oneplus never fails to impress with their new phone but this time you would feel something is missing may be because oneplus has already raised their bar so much that user always expect more from them when i saw t first time somewhere in my subconscious mind i had taken my decision to buy this beast but before i reviewed so may phones from one nord to iphone my ratings design and build camera quality battery backup and charging time performance undoubtedly design and build is unmatched so sturdy and beautiful camera quality might be discussion point they should have given more in camera because phone comes in high range and premium level but current camera is not so bad noone can beat its battery charging time and backup time within min to highly impressive it will survive around day for average user performance is good installed and ran multiple apps at a time never faced any hung issue or app carsh issueas i said even if wow factor is missing this time i would say good phone with nice overall performance design and features if you get it in sale around k its a good deal go for it nothing to regret purchased it some days ago switched from my asus so i had really high expectations and well it did perform somewhat close to it but also many downgrades as well im just gonna list as pros and cons pros i mean snapdragon gen you can expect amazing performance why not top tier since its the best processor android could offer well cause i feel the processor on this one is under clocked to reduce heating but its holding up pretty good in terms of gaming and other benchmark tests and stuff build quality is actually good especially the back the back does feel amazing and while holding it does feel like a premium phone expect for the frame ofc its made of polycarbonate but we can get a hang to it later software im not gonna sit around and cry about their merging with oppo i feel its fast and a good ui of course some old features not available now since ive used a oneplus in the past for some weeks but we can get a hang to this new oxygen os just hope its not completely turned to color os charging is just insanity on this one switching from a phone which used to take around hours to get fully charged to this one almost finishing full charge under minutes and ive witnessed it several times its just impressive but some issues and ill talk about it in cons networking and connecting is fast and good havent faced any major issues in my networking experiences calling is a good experience connecting with networks and bluetooth is extremely fast good overallcons about the processor like i said it is under clocked and the benchmark scores proved it a bit although i dont care about benchmark scores and just want to keep my belief in real life usage so it is doing good polycarbonate frame and no alert slider like really at least we deserved a metal frame at this price segment which is what upset me a bit not really a big fan of alert slider so i didnt mind that part the camera setup is so so so average and stupid aside from the main lens the wide and macro just did not make sense at all and are completely worthless in this segment this is literally the same setup from nord t but just a better software optimisation front camera is alright too nothing that great charging indeed is one of the key factors in this phone but it takes a toll on the battery backup usually in my usage i have to charge it times for it to be used the whole day it drains a bit more than i expected it to also theres no option available to disable w charging to let it charge in usual speed to test the battery only except for the night optimisation mode which is kind of good in my opinionphone is a good segment in this price range and if you do believe in the particular brand image and its products then go for it although iqoo t does provide a better camera setup with a bit more aggressive processor performance but this device does the job tooso basically i am reviewing it after usage of month and days i am giving it star because of alert slider missing lets me clear it by points battery is awesome it will get full charge in minutes seconds it lasts more than hours to me camera quality is nice specially night mode is awesome some improvements should be done for selfie camera but it clicks nice picture no lagging no hang it runs smoothly and very fast only thing that disappoints is alert slider that is missing in this phone video quality is awesome while you record and it is stable while watching any ott streaming quality is awesome you can fully enjoy it speaker of phone is perfect even at lowest volume you can clearly hear the voice on call
3,audio contains lots of distortion when using speaker battery life is goodi bought this phone for my staff who can handle only these basic variety types she is very happy and loves the colornice onehghbattery backup is great didnt like center button design separate four buttons would fit great rather than one square one irony is that it is for indian customers but couldnt find gujarati language in this phone overall product is good for normal usage bluetooth radio camera memory card dual sim games are added features for fungood productits amazingand worth the cost the only weak point is that the response from the phone is a little lateafter pressing buttonsotherwise its best under this rangenice one easy use and more flexible one easy to carry good battery life and camera quality also good not bad sound quality is good over all value for money
4,i liked the watch the battery of this watch is so good that before use i charged this watch and its been weeks and this watch still have battery left and nagative side is i ordered black strap watch and i got grey strap watch and this is sellers mistake i tried to return this and ive called amazon help line then hear my problem and see it online that i got wrong item and then they say they will connect me to other person who will solve this and then no one pick the call the ring just continue to ring and after min i thought that no one is gonna pick the call ever and i disconnected and start using it watch have some basic futures and i like itone of the best product in this price range been using it for a year now and i have no complaints built quality is good steps count is not very accurate and we can say that the software lacks in accuracy in many ways when compared to other big brands applefossil but i have seen worst touch is very smooth and the notification alerts works as expected this is water and swim resistant i am not sure if it has ip rating but i believe this is dust proof as well since i have been using it for almost a year nowgood product for this price rangeeverytime sleep mode has to activate this should not be done it should be automaticallygood productbezels are big but its ok for this price range and i am satisfied with the productwatch is beautiful and upto mark only one con in this watch you cant attend the call and revert you can only revert by messagesnice
4,updateits been months since i first got boat rockerz some of the dislikes ive mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes i said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but im quite used to it and im loving it the second point is i said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but i was wrong you might ask why here is whyafter a long gap i visited my father who is an audiophile he has numerous highend headphones but unfortunately he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it i said yes i regret it he paired it with his device and played a song boy you got to see the grin on his face d he said im keeping it you buy another one poor me was forced to buy another one a few days back i got another one one thing i noticed in two of my purchase isthe audio cable is no good both my audio cable had the same issueso the moral of the story is hide it from your audiophile dad or brother they will unceremoniously snatch it from youjokes apart people you cant go wrong with this purchase its worth every square inchhappy shoppingend of updatei got this product days back and i got it for rs lightning deal of course this is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the productthree days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry i cant help the excitementlikes good built quality it is sturdy for the price the build quality is great it is not flimsy the ear cushions are good enough sound qualityif you are an audiophile this is not for you bass is decent nothing to go overboard as noticed in other reviews bass is deep enough for the price connectivity pairing is easy connects like a breeze dual mode wired and wireless boat rockerz comes with an aux cableif you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone i couldnt find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though i absolutely loved this feature battery backup im impressed with the battery backup of this beast ive been using it for days for hrs a day still its running so i guess the hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick i presume its true so far so good will update it after a months usagedislikes sound quality is more on the flatter side when you compare it with budget wired headphones like sennheiser cx street ii bass is not too deep you wont get that ambiance boats website saysdont just be loud be loud and clear nope sorry ive to disappoint you on this when its loud its not at all clear a lot of distortions are there when you are loud comfort believe me its not at all comfortable for prolonged usage your ear will beg you to take it off after mins if you have high fortitude you can push it till hrs if you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman range boats says meters range in my experience if you go beyond meters then the voice will break you will never ever get mtrs range trust me on that and im experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but i dont know whether it will be a problem down the line will let you guys know about it later if its a problem flimsy aux cable i cant complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind remember i paid only for it but with certain devices the aux was not working properly mi note had issues mi also had issues with aux not sure whether its the problem with my device but it worked flawlessly on my laptop wafer thin service centers boat gives yr warranty but what good is it if you cant find any service centers near you this is a hit or miss guys voice cancellation i didnt find this effective maybe its just me not sure microphone is pretty much useless you cant make calls with this headsetsome alternatives these are all wired headphones comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still i compare it with them because boat rockerz comes with an aux cable and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to yousennheiser cx street ii i dont think boat can beat this ones quality the sound is incomparable the base is deep nice fidelity nice ambiance and for a price of this is unbeatable budget wired inear headphone i own of this beauty total value for money if you are an audiophile and are on a tight budget then i cant a better alternative than this soundmagic ec inear headphones with mic blackgold this is another tvfm earphonesony extra bass mdrxb onear headphonesdont buy it if you are an audiophile obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones d if you intend to use it for long hoursbuy it if you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance if you require a wired and wireless package in oneverdict id give this headphone a score of if you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hasslefree bluetooth headphone with good performance then close your eyes and buy this beast trust me you wont regret it you wont be disappointed in this price range i couldnt find any other headphone with such a performance we dont have many options do we p pthe actual price is rs and amazon claim they are giving discount pls dont fall for that i would not recommend paying more than rupees for this headphonenote im not an expert in this field this is just a lay mans reviewthank you for reading the review and i hope this will help you with your purchase decisionmy boat wired in ears were giving out after hard use and i wanted a new pair of headphones and i wanted them to be over the head types like this one i also wanted one with both aux and bluetooth options since i would be using it for the tv laptop and my phone i have fumbled with this strata of the headphone market previously and after buying good for nothing ones from motorola i chanced upon thisvalue for moneygood bassnice sound qualitygood build but not premiumif you can get it below rs then it is a very good dealits difficult to let go of my boat headphones i bought this on for a k price on sale the bluetooth was working fine but it went off after an year i know this would happen and thats when the legendary aux cable comes in ive been using it with the aux cable for almost years again but later the top headphone band broke off i used a fevistick to stick it up and used it i stretched it even further but it broke again but there is no difference in soundquality what so ever so far its been a soldi years since usage of this product still trying to stretch it further if it doesnt work i may hvae to say good by to this beast of a product and its sad to note that the current boat products on offer fail to deliver this robust quality theyve become the company that focuses on quantity over quality nowadays evolutions aside i gotta respect this product for what it has given me so far i genuinely reviewed after years and its still working but once head strip was broke i fixed it by using youtube video overall its very good purchase for medont think about specs you can blindly buy because it worth iti recently purchased the boat rockerz bluetooth headphones they have great sound quality and the soft padded ear cushions are very comfortable the battery life is also impressive with up to hours of playback overall im very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of bluetooth headphonesunder rs it is best head phone sound quality super bass good noise cancelation not bad product weight not heavynice headphone nhibole to jhakassound quality is very good and bass is also good but i was expecting more like theatre bass but not like that hhh laalach karna buri chijh h hum sudhrenge nhi kabhii think u r bored sum of this headphone mast hai enjoyinggood quality easily connected my lg k smart tv

4,productliramark webcam cover slideevents datesorder date delivery date review date statusreceived and acceptedratingsdescriptionused terms in the description slider sliding part of webcam cover static frame static back frame of webcam cover screen frame the laptops screen framethe product is sturdy invisible for the mutual color theme for device and product and well manufactured if the device has the same matte black theme this webcam cover can easily be merged and becomes a part of the devices body as you can see my laptop has a matte black screen frame and astonishingly the product has merged with it the little plastic container in the package will act as storage for the rest of the webcam coversit is ultrathin as described by the company with acquiring about a millimeter thickness this thickness can cope with the windows laptops as they are having the rubber buffers on the top side of the screen frame because those buffers act as a spacer between the screen and the lowerup bodykeyboard of the laptop to avoid any harm to the screen this spacer is advantageous to the webcam cover as closing the lid will not harm the screen screen frame and laptop lowerup body but still dont put pressure on the location where the webcam cover is installed as the thickness of the webcam cover is slightly more in the micrometers than the rubber buffers of the laptop itself the sliding function is very smooth but be sure to push only the slider part and not the whole static part as it will make the grip weak over time of usagethe device can be used with any phone and monitor as they have no issue with opening and closing the lidsnow for the mac laptop users it is not a product for your laptop and never try this product for your mac laptops as the mac laptops have a stunning plain glass screen that is covering the whole screen frame part and has no spacers that is theres no space left after closing the laptop lid and hence upon installation of this product will damage crackbreak the plain glass screeninstallation is easy remove the blue tape and carefully stick the cover as a sticker using the scale for support or else you could stick it a little inclined after sticking rub your palm for heat generation and grab the screen frame from both palms and apply the ultralight pressure and hold the position up to a good to minutes and there you go for your satisfied invisible lifeimportant even if not in use slide it times once a week and clean it as per your device cleaning schedule to avoid jamming due to debris or dustoverall it is a good product for me it has worked awesome green signal from herethank you suggestionsto the manufacturer notice the static frame of the webcam cover and make its edges the edges close to the slider smooth rounding off or fillet so that upon sliding the slider with a fat finger it can easily slide over the edges of the static frame hence do not put an unnecessary force on a static frameto the seller well packagingto the consumer check for the rubber spacersbuffers provided in the laptop like windows laptops if it is then you can use the webcam cover if not like mac laptops its not the product for you even for windows laptops after installing a webcam cover try not to put pressure on the webcam cover location for long slide it times once a week to avoid jammingdisclaimerthe reviews and ratings hasve been made upon personal usages experiments experiences perspectives for specific products acquired deliveredi usually dont trust my webcam so i thought of giving this product a try it was delivered within days after placing the order i received it on th june first impressions were really good i always had a fear that it would crack my screen when i close my laptop lid after reading the reviews but its been months and theres not even a single crack in my screen𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 you will get webcams covers in the package its extremely thin so it wont cause any issues when you close the laptophp pavilion gaming used here but it might cause issues in the case of laptops with thin screens like macbook air asus tuf asus rog while closing the lid due to the pressure on the screen at the end its your choice𝗔𝗱𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 i am sorry to say that the adhesion of this product is quite weak it literally falls off after a week of applying it i had to throw of it as it became useless i only had the last piece remaining𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝗱𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 eventually i was able to find a solution for this problem remove the stock adhesion by gently applying isopropyl alcohol then apply a strong adhesive glue i used fevi kwick apply it only on the back edges of the webcam cover since its extremely thin i used thin needle to apply super glue gently on it or else the superglue will spill out and make a mess immediately you have to place it on the webcam of our laptop and then youre good to goits been months after using the super glue technique forget about about falling it has not even moved a bit no effect on the quality of my webcam the cover wont interfere when you are using your webcam in meetings and fully covers it when you want privacy overall its a good product except for the fact that it has poor adhesiongood producti wish i had known this before ordering luckily a friend made me aware the very same day i had applied itapple urges people not to close their macbook macbook air or macbook pro while such camera covers are applied because it can lead to cracks in the screen when closing your macbook it may also affect the ambience light sensor but that is the lesser issue as compared to a potentially cracked screen and high repair costsmacbooks are designed in a way that when closing no foreign object thicker than an average printer paper mm should ever be between the screen and the body of the laptop this item is inches thick that is mm six times the recommended thicknessif you are going to use it on your macbook be sure to completely remove it before closing your laptop you can use it without worry on imac as its a desktop and doesnt get closed you can also use it with any normal laptop where the camera isnt embedded inside the glass screen if you have a laptop where the camera is embedded in the plastic frame around the screen it should be okayfor disappointed macbook users like me there are two options one is you trust apple who are saying their camera is hardwired to the green camera light according to them one cannot work without the other so even if someone hacks your camera you will know it is on because the green light will be glowingif youre not sure about their reliability and you still want to cover your camera use a piece of thin tape apple does advice against anything which could leave adhesive residue on their screen but frankly if you just clean it with some screen cleanser after removing i dont see how there could be an issuewhy am i still giving this product stars it reached in good condition is easy to install and use and it will still be useful to people with other laptops or desktop screens with inbuilt camera its not a bad product they just need to stop advertising it for macbooks
3,network reception is not that great people who call get out of coverage area message even though the phone show two bars of network the same sim and network worked fine in my smartphonecan use this as a secondary phone or as a backup device and cannot rely on it as a primary device the only benifit which i saw on this is it supports volte and can sync the contacts from android phone which avoid manual taks of creating each contact manually product is average it doesnt suck like the many contemporary feature phones from other brands that being said its not great either with some little annoyance noticeddont expect much as its a feature phone but then some negatives are theres a voice distortion noticed occasionally when receiving calls have to end the call redo it then the voice is clearinitially thought it was an issue of a particular product so returned the phone got a new onehowever the new one also has this have tried some methods to rectify this including switching off the volte till now this issue has not cropped up yet thankfully no notepadcome on how hard is it to give a notepad on this phone if it can do texting contact saving how difficult is it to give a notepad to record stuffs no youtubesince theres no dedicated youtube app tried to access it from the opera browser but to a big disappointment it cant properly load the youtube page let alone play any videoyes its not a phone for constant youtube watching but since its a very important site not only for entertainment but also for information news it would have been great if youtube was enabled it supports g so why not youtube the camera is very badcant expect smartphone standard camera but this vga camera is really bad nokia could have increased the price about bucks give an average megapixel camera on itsometimes we take photos not for posting on social media but for information like the name of a store or number of a vehiclea basic camera that does that job is all that is required was delighted to see an english with oxford app assumed they were very thoughtful to give an offline dictionarybut then upon opening it turned out to be a demo version with pay inr play free trailwas even disappointed when upon clicking the free trail option it required internet was directed to the opera websitewhats the point to thisother than this the phone is not bad with some positive features like wireless radio radio recording big screen compared to other feature phones voice recorder torch call recording option converter app stylish retro design a good easily typable keypadall os ok but battery life is not good while we r not useing a single call also but its draining battery lifegood addon phone battery life is days if usage is not very heavy fm works without wired headphones call quality if good dual nanosim no profile setting option as was the case with previously released nokia feature phones preinstalled games but all except snakes are trial version internet browser facebook music video player are there but no option to install any other app as there is no app storegud for one model in nokia and worth for moneybettery not works more than days even not using phoneit works like any other feature phones from the time but the build quality is considerably low good battery life and good call quality is there nothing special other than that

3,below is the experience so far received a defective product battery was getting drained out in few hours wifi kept getting disconnected and almost every app was giving trouble including google maps location was not getting captured tried to return it on the th day of purchase after running into issues with every app i open tried on th night as well but phone froze and was not able to even switch off and restart the mobile amazon app was in this phone used another phone to check how to force reboot next morning and switched on the mobile amazon said return window is closed on th night and now i need to call samsung customer care directly for replacement called samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely couldnt identify the issue informed i will have to visit the samsung service center to figure out the issue first visit to center they did a software update week old phone now not sure what update would be pending and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week they also whipped out the entire apps in the phone faced issues the very same evening lived with it for one more day and went back next morning second visit they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced i requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesnt allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery which was defective they told me i will have to contact samsung customer case number again if i want a product replacement as they dont have the authority for that called customer care number again and they inform me i have to contact amazon for product replacement as amazon was the sellerso back to step will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end if i manage to reach thereupdate all customer care said they cant replace the phone so surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement they gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced again whipped out of the apps which i had downloaded and logged in again i checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and i figured the problem still persist battery was draining out by the minute i showed it to them they told me its a new battery and will take some time to stabilize they also asked me to buy a super fast charger while i bought from them to not take chances they asked me to check for days and confirm used for days same situation no improvement went back to them again they checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this i have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true by this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests they kept the phone for days and returned saying everything is fixed phone started functioning normally finally but i was sick and tired of the experience i called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund they refused with all their might and said phone is working now during the process i also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for days i officially registered a complaint but still no luck of returning the phoneupdate on nov th i was traveling and outside the country on nov st while using the phone and with charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some tv from s tried switching of the mobile and restarting multiple times no luck still grid lines my flight bookings hotel bookings and everything one can think of was in the mobile and my month old phone is not responding to anything possible friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till i completed the trip reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center nov th am writing this update sitting at the customer care center they mentioned patch issue software update dint happen at this point i know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation no month old phones screen will stop responding because of software update missing they are opening the phone again to operate it after again refusing my request for money refundits really good smartphone in its range packed with features and brand like samsung never fails to amuse with what they deliver at a given price point i still give it a stars as battery could be better it also looses a point for not including a chargerphone looks are good the charging speed is ultra slow even with the fast charger w original also camera quality is not even like mp total lied about mp samsung ui is not very friendly and easy other brands have better and smoother uiphone is very sleek bought brown shade which looks much premium in hand at what it actually is good budget model phoneyou can not deny brand sumsung is a brand overall good product for long usegood worckcharger should have been part of it but product looks goodpricewise a little overpricedsome of the cons are a little rigid fingerprint sensor after months of use i frequently encounter a lag when unlocking the phone battery life not up to the mark struggles to go the entire day even with regular use no mm jack and a buggy btpros a very good camera excellent screen superb sound qualityif you somehow get this for below k then go for it or else there are better options available
4,posting this after days of continous usagei came from oneplus t that too because last to last week i had an accident and my t has dead on the spotafter watching a lot of reviews on youtube and amazon i thought i should give it a chancefirst impression as you all know op t has small display so its hard for first days to usetyping because of big display a little heavy but that could be because of upgraded species and battery from my last t solid built but it if its metal build then it will be more beautiful space fusion color is looking killer flash charger works awsome but charger design can be improved display is crisp and clear but but in dark apps ie chrome brave linkdin etc youll notice a color change from black to greyish color that gives a cheap feel and i dont know if its a software or hardware issueactual review while gaming call of dutymobile has some lags and bugs and there is no option to block notificationcalls even after mute notification onn everything is coming on screen and its very frustrating and annoying battlefield mobile ground asphalt clash of clans battle royale are working flowless some apps like flipkart and airtel gives some error screen zoom automatically while opening might be because of android or something else now this is very weird that this phone reset a few setting automatically themselves when i dont want that i dont want to set them everyday before using my phone ie i am using bouncer to remove app permission when not in use and this phone remove accessibility setting even after batter optimization and background runwhile listing to music i want paranomic sound but it reset to default automatically gesture are not working fine this can be fixed with future updates i admit that funtouch os has some more customization then oxygen os but it is missing some basic customization feature like i cannot change accent color shape size and the default one is looking very cheap must be because oneplus oxygen os is in my eyes but i am not overcome from oxygen os oxygen os is lub funtouch os is very uncomfortable for me for the first days but now im getting it a little less feature in gaming mode in comparison to iqoo camera average as of now takes good picture in nightevening time and selfie camera is awsome ois works good as per the budget and gives value for money day time picture are good but something it changes the saturationcolor by itself automatically no heat observed while gamingdoing heavy task minimal heat that every phone has now a days and it is c outside so this is not a big deal for me screen recorder and mic works awsome crisp clear display except the issue i told above sot in one charge minutes charging time no bugs lags observed till date hz refresh rate made it monster some preinstalled bloatware can be uninstall but some has to be force stop only or you can use adb commande to remove permanently a few apps are unnecessary like browser and a screen virus scan comes just after install an app from play store that very annoying and somehow i stopped that speaker volume is sufficient enoug loud in a roomconclusionin k its worth for money with snapdragon processor and intelligent chiponly thing that i dont like is funtoch os because it not gives a premium flagship phone experincehas some bugs as of now ie in gaming mode in a few apps camera display that might fixed with future updatesoverall worth for money and yes you can pick it over oneplus rt like i said youll probably feel bad for a week with its funtoch os but youll be okay with it after sometimejust because of oxygen os spending k is not a great idea i thinkcamera quality is good video stability is awesome processing and other functions are nice ui is not that good and battery life is not upto the markpros super fast app experience due to snapdragon super fast charging good display but not comparable with super amoled of samsung other phone good large display size no heating in general use only seen when using camera video call but it cools down fast accessories given with the phone like fast charger usb c to female adater thin screen guard and translucent back cover ok cameracons display is not super amoled or vivid like samsung a or s series phone battery drains fast avg front camera earth current can be felt when touching back camera while chargingi was skeptical about the phone would perform as sd has its own share of heating issues and all but for k this is one of the best phones in the segmenti had pixel a and nothing phone as other options although their camera and software might be better in some aspects the performance the camera and gaming features this phone offers is incrediblealso pixel and nothing phone dosent give charger in the box so its a plus pointthe only issue i faced is when i switch the phone to hz it starts to act as it lowers to fps or something and the battery life is average its charge in the evening for sure but decent battery coupled with a fast charger is more than enoughi use nova launcher with this and this solves the home screen style recommended to allgood display good sound although sound is not much loud but have a sweet bass smooth experience camera good but front video could be given fps good haptic every thing is good up to the mark but battery life could be better overall satisfied with the productthey are ok i can rate mobile is worth its moneyidont use fingerprint and camera are very good battery life ok

4,this smart watch is very nice one its battery back up is also very nice bluetooth connectivity is also excellent but wheneveor i try to see share price it takes few more seconds by pressing side key it must be seen by changing the page without pressing side key to open new menuit is nicely designed device good for tracking daily steps and heavy exerciseonce charged fully battery discharges within daysthanks for offerbest in marketwatch is nice but some features are not there like ai assistant while the other low budget watches haveworst customer support noise has i have raised the complain times but no one has contacted me yet and really worst if we call customer care it takes half n hour to connect they will tell our executives will call you and get the products no one is calling after days they complain has been solved and closedi did not use sleeping track yet but touch screen and over app experience is very nice and display quality is also nicenice product
4,the cover felt sturdy and came in sealed package there were protective films covering the cover from both side which had to be removed before putting cover on the phonethe fit was perfect and to take off the cover we might need to use some force overall the quality is good will update after few months of usage about the colour fadingscratchesthe cover wraps around the iphone pro max too tightly making it difficult to remove once put but at the same time the cover feels solid and sturdy providing complete protection the phoneexcellent product avoid local market product for such premium phones value for moneyexcellentnormal transparent one but the price they are asking is too much like they are trying to loot pplawesomebought this as spigen is a decent brand this is my initial case as i am waiting for better cases to be designed and released overall a decent case with decent protection for the phone and camerasthis product is of good quality

3,i have purchased it for my galaxy watch mm it fits perfectly and the touchscreen works good but packaging should improvei am writing this review after using the product for month nice case for samsung watch no touch problem i faced till now best thing about this case is it comes with warrenty so that you can replace it if any defect product you receivedfells hard plasticlookwise its goodthere is an air gap between the screen and the case which means its made for a thicker body which means its made for the watch classic you have to press hard on the screen guard so you actually touch the screendo not buy for watch otherwise it should be ok for watch classic though i cannot confirm the case has integrated screen protector and protects the sides obviously it doesnt cover the back the blue looked weird on my black watch overall from a protection perspective the product is very good look is good only the touch screen sensitivity needs to improve product for samsung watches
4,its been days since i using the device extensivelyi bought it on the last freedom sale for rs including k instant discount couponfirst let me be clear i bought s fe g with snapdragon not s fe with exynos and i am a user who uses phone most of the time this review may be long but its worth to read it if youre buying this productlet me divide between the pros and consfirst i would like like to start with pros of the device pros display samsung has been already popular for its amoled displays but i saw some of the reviewers wrote about some display issues here they might have got some defective piece i have no issues with my display its been long time i saw a great display like this with hz it is super smoothalso it is very bright on outdoors and can decrease it to very low while using at low light conditions ps no tint issues the in display finger print scanner is very fast and didnt faced any issues with it stereo speakers as an extensive multimedia user this is one of the most favorable feature for mebelieve me you cant find any other device with such great sound quality in this price segment its almost like flagship devices both the speakers are adequately loud battery as a person whos shifting from a normal hz device phone i was very worried about the battery life of this device at hz but it surprised me very well initially i thought i would need to switch to hz for better battery life for daily usagebut i didnt even thought this device would give this much great battery life at hzat hz i am getting around hours of minimum sot screen on time the maximum sot i got at hz is hours minutesi didnt checked battery life at hz because i didnt use it at hz even a single day the battery life is excellent rear cameras i am not a very good photographer or something i am just an ordinary person who use camera occasionallyi was very excited to use the telephoto lens which only can be found on flagship devices and it performs very welladded some camera samples above pic ultrawide pic telephoto pic may not be clear as it was when taken due to compression of the image while uploading both the three cameras primary ultrawide telephoto performs very wellif youre a camera guy you should definitely check this out performance ram management im not a gamer i use my device for daily usage of social media ott platforms calls messages etc but i use it extremelyi didnt faced any kind of heating issues with the device until nowalso ram management of the device is excellent i am a person who uses appsbackground at single time and i didnt have any issues of closing down the apps one ui i was a stock android guy but one ui actually surprised me it is very well optimised and very userfriendly for single hand usageinitial days i found it little hard to use the stock menu of one ui but im now got used to itps i didnt found any kind of ads on my device as i didnt sign up or used any samsung apps build quality even though its back is made up of plastic the overall build quality is super premium the aluminium frame gives us a feel like using a flagship device future proof the device has g bands ip rating wireless charging which are very hard to find on any device in this price bracketip wireless charging are mostly only found on flagship devices its good to see samsung brings it at lower pricethis is the best future proof device as of nowso these are the major pros i noticed as of now now lets move to the conscons no hdr support on netflix as an extensive multimedia user i found it very frustrating even mid range devices offering hdr support on netflix samsungs flagship killer doesnt have hdr supportit will not be fixed via ota update no gb variant this is actually not a problem for most of the people but as a power user who uses dual sim i found it little difficultbut if youre a single sim user luckily it have hybrid solution so you can use a sim card expandable memory card gorilla glass other competitors are providing atleast gg in this price range but s fe g has just gg which also im not sure as it is not mentioned officially anywhere but at the end of the day glass is glass it will broke no headphone jack it is not any kind of unusual thing most of the phones above k segment doesnt have headphone jackso we have to buy mm to type c adapter type c earphones or bluetooth solutions note only buy original samsung type c adapter else it may not support no w charger it is not actually a con for me as i prefer low watt charger which is good for battery health and beneficial for long term usage but it may be a con for you although the device supports w charging only w charger is provided inside the box they should have given w inside the boxi didnt have any issues with w charger but it would be great if they bundle it with w as competitors are way ahead in terms of charging speedfor the reference of charging speed both w w will full charge the device almost at the same time but using w you can get about within minutes where as with w chargerfull charge time i usually takes is hour and minutes front camera i am not a selfie guy but if youre a person whos looking for a selfie device just dont buy it its not like the front camera quality is really bad or anything but its not even near to the rear camera quality and you can find better selfie smartphones in this price rangeconclusion if youre a person who wants a device for normal day to day usage with good battery life great rear cameras great performance better software support better build quality and use it for more than years the cons mentioned above doesnt bother youjust buy it i am sure you wont be disappointedits been about days since i got this phone i got it for on prime day sale for the price its goodpros camera coming from poco x the camera quality on this is amazing according to the price it gives you good colours contrast focus and everything that you want it has ois which is very apparent while recording at k the stability is worse but set it to p and the videos will be amazingly stable and the main advantage of ois other than stable video is great night mode shots hold the phone stable for a while and along with ois you will get great photos with accurate colors and nice exposure attached samples display absolutely best samsung displays are the best hz fhd flows smoothly colors and calibration is top notch brightness is good but i felt its a little insufficient under direct sunlight its visible but could be better oneui the main reason for upgrading to this phone was software oneui is the absolute best android skin right now it has way too many customisations in it and lets you personalise your phone to a very high degree like theres a feature to read out the name of the person whos calling if your wearing headphones it took me days to fully go through all the settings and change them to my needs also knoxx security is a special mention knoxx security is a software and hardware feature in samsung phones which protects your phone from all kinds of attacks and keeps your data safe even if it gets stolen you can remotely delete all your data secure folder allows you to store data in a separate storage and many more such good features while being a very feature rich and storage heavy skin it still feels very very smooth and fast to use unlike miui or other skins it doesnt stutter much and bugs are lessthere are many other small pros like good stereo speakers nice premium build quality good data and wifi speeds other such features that you wont notice but definitely make a difference in your experiencecons software i know i said its a pro but i say this in the aspect of updates this phone was launched in march in india and samsung promises year android version updates and additional year of security updates but theres a lot of confusion regarding if or not this phone will receive android it will receive a for sure theres a lot of debate on what they will do with because of global version launch date being earlier and yada yada basically the phones life maybe to years if they give a but to if not i researched on the internet a few people say that it will receive a while i was few say its not its hard to say whos correct so assume its not getting a if you are going for it battery the battery on this phone is mah and its good enough for a days use but thats because i use it lightly not much online streaming no gaming light social media and other usual stuff if you use it even a tad bit more heavily you will run out within a day if youre going outside for the better part of a daylike a day trip to somewhere nearbyits better keep a power bank handy in terms of screen on time numbers i once got hours of sot on light usage hr youtube and hr streaming i was at home and used wifi all the timei got hrs sot when i went outside for a day trip i took many photos and videos and the phone shutdown before i could reach home on a mixed use day you can get to hours of sotfinal verdict the life of the phone in terms of software support is not great but you will get on time updates and almost no bugs in the software so if you want to buy it you can and exchange it after maybe years for other models but if you planning on using it for longer than years better avoid it in the upcoming diwali and dussera sales the price might further drop to k even i am just speculating but keep in mind your requirements and go accordinglyas always amazing delivery by amazon

4,packageing was fine havent tested it working functionality yetjust got the bank and the first light is not working idk why need to check and if it continues ill return it asapgood device for such costgood for fast charginggood for smartphonebattery extensions the product is very big and heavy would have been better if it had liion batteries to save space and weight the product charges iphone about in an hour but rest charging is very slow it has a dedicated light green to depict fast charging mode the device helped me survive days without charger where it charged phones i had fast charger compatible samsung phone m ordinary smart samsung phone j prime and one iphone se which it was able to keep afloat please note if try to charge multiple phones then fast charging is not available on any port usb and usbc pd flights allow only in checkin baggage so keep in mind that you would have to carry this bulky device with yourself dimensions lxbxthick not weight on scale but seems like kg and that is a lot of weightthis power bank full charge at hour and i phone will be time full charged not timethe charging is super goodi havent touched my phone charger for days and completely used this power bank for charging and still it wasnt dried outbut the problem is weight too heavy i must say

3,bought it in januaryposting it in august so ive used it almost months and giving honest reviewin short if you are getting it during sale time then its a steal dealalso in regular price bw its a good productsound quality is good enough loud at volume bass is also ok whenever needed it produces punchy bass overall balancedmic quality is good in indoor conditionbut in noisy environment you cant rely on this recevier cant clearly listen to youyou can do gaming as company claiming low latencyi myself didnt test itnow about battery backupcompany claim it will give battery backup of hours with case hours in single chargeadditional hours times charge via case but in practical use it gives total hours playback it will give around hours backup on single charge of buds volumeif you only listen to music or watching videobut no call or gaming you can charge the earbuds full times via case so additional hoursjust one issue with its designsuit case type box not easy to carry in pocket i would say its a personal preference if you are into good looksdesign then its not for younow its regular pricing varries between rs in this price range also it is one of the best tws under i will tell why now a days many brands are launching tws in the market under most of them sound almost similar difference is like they are just marketing their tws with huge hours of battery backup by youtubersreviewers hours of playtime is just myth ive personally used trukeairbuds litebuds f which is by far the most false promising brand claiming hours of battery in their every twsbut only give hours even other tws of boatairdopes pro which claim hours playback only give around hoursdefy gravity z claiming hours only give hours if you are impressed by their looks huge battery backup and thinking to buy thoseyou will be disappointed after purchase instead go with thisyou will not be disappointedi read the negative comments first and decided not to buy it because the comments said it gives high latency on gaming like pubg and also it falls from ear while running and that the difference between normal and beast mode slightly had differencebut a pubg youtuber recommended me this so i decided to give it a try after trying out myselflet me provide the facts for youi have a boat rockerz headphone which obviously should be better than this airdope but this airdope surprised me by doing x better in providing accurate sound in pubgits been days i used it daily for hours on full charge it has no buttons and it works on touch sensor which was impressive for me and in pubg it doesnt give delay as written in the comments it has a good latency better than what i had expected from the negative commentssometimes though i faced the issue where one side of the airdope stops working because its either on standby without detecting the user or a bug which is included in the faqguidehelp card in the box im satisfied in terms of gamingfor sports like running i wouldnt recommend because it slips away however maybe u can tie the airdope with a thread attached to ur neck so that its safe from landing on the ground im gonna try that please dont use both the airdopes while running on the roads with vehicles running for your own safety keep one side of your ear free for hearing sounds from your environmentpros the level of volume it gets to is just awesome it can get incredibly loud so if youre at the gym these are perfect awesome bass noise cancellation is just great if you simply put them on without even any music playing u wont be able to hear things around u very well its great for places like gym lovely battery life ive had them a week and only had to charge the case once that too for just a few minutes and the earbuds themselves leave them in case for just five min and youll be getting battery for a long long while they are very comfortable can be used for long periods of time affordable the touch controls are very responsive tap to pause double tap right one for next song double tap left one for either rewind or previous song can also pick up calls just by tapping multiple ear coverings are provided with it type c portcons the sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc the bass is the highlight so its great for music but for movies or gaming you wont get the most crisp audio some connectivity issues sometimes i have to turn my bluetooth on and off many times for it to work this is occasional not a daily or frequent occurrence edit after month use its now a very frequent issue the mic quality is good if you are using your phone but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on pc sometimes on whatsapp the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes not an issue if you are the one dialing i hope its just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issueoverall i needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there lol so im very very happy with themhighly recommended for music andor as a more affordable option as compared to jbl etc

4,hi guys bought this yesterday so havent used it much so an early review but the most detailed review so please read till the end very important points are mentionedlooks are cute it looks really nice and elegant i am using it with a macbook air so far it seems there are no problems using it the scrolling is smooth connection does not drop and there is no lag connection is instant there is no pairing required its plug and play along with the dongle provided with itit sits low on the table feels weighty but not in a wrong way the battery adds to its weight but i have used heavier mice before and this one feels just right it has good grip nothing to complain about thatbuttons are nice and clicks are satisfactory not too noisy they are just right scroll wheel doesnt feel cheap at all though i believe it couldve been better quality body is matt finish and doesnt leave fingerprints on it though if youre someone who eats and handles the mouse then itll show the oil prints and thats true with any peripherals the mouse doesnt feel cheap overall but it is definitely plasticky though not in the bad sense it is definitely not cheap looks wisethere is an on off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery which is included when the mouse is not in use there is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light so thats a good thing and a definite plus the overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with itnow over to a major flaw the mouse connects only though its own usb dongle which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself inside the battery door which i found mighty impressive and not through the laptops bluetooth now this means two things you have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario and worse still if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle then youre stuck and i dont think you get only the dongle youll have to check that with the seller and then the mouse is left useless in that case now over to the problem i am facing which i did not see anyone else mention in their reviews i use a macbook so it doesnt have usbc inputs which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle i actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector which is not cheap because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive macbook of course that is a problem with the macbook and not with the mouse but consider this point it is very important it will not connect over macbooks bluetooth otherwise it works well with the macbook the only caveat i found is the tracking speed on level is too slow and on level is too fast youll have to get used to that thing it doesnt feel very natural as the trackpad on the macbook feels because of that speed problem but otherwise the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesnt jump around at least with my mouse also the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad and i feel it could have been made better but i guess at the cost you really cant complain too muchoverall i think a good buy but the compulsion of having to use it with its own dongle is a major drawback i feel if that doesnt bother you then nothing else should keep you from buying this product especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than bucks which is what it cost methe quality of power button is very low easily it can breaknice product works as expected as of now no issuesgoodvery smooth works on almost every surface paper table cloth etctheres a bit rattle sound of the plastic which is just above the buttons rightleft clicksit will not bother most of you i am a bit obsessive with these kind of things sopersonally i opened the mouse and stuck a paper inside the plastic which presses the click button resulting in no rattle sound now mouse only makes sound when you click the buttons click click clickbattery life of logitech is known to be very goodquality good dpi good good accuracy on off switch available smooth good deal at reasonable pricegood product on which you can use for long timethis is good mouse thanks to amazon for providing this product at reasonable price very sharp and correct working mouse
3,the product is a good one however once i received one with a small bump and i replaced it to receive one which wont erase one part of the screenthe product is very handy and easy to use however you would have to replace a couple of times to receive a good condition producteasy to use and since we bought it a two weeks before good experience until nowi will review more after using it for atleast two monthsits fun with sustainable learning for kids i ordered two tablets for my twins and both are liking itat first delete button was not worked so i thought the product is damaged but there is lockscreen button on backside and its locked overall good product thank you amazonso far so good a good alternative for paper it works fine lets see how long it will last nice for kids to play withniceawesome my son like it very much
3,sound quality is goodenough loud at volume bass is also ok mic quality is also good in indoor condition receiver can clearly listen to you i didnt use it in noisy environment or in outdoors company claims there is low latency while gamingi dont know exactly if it works or not sound call quality wise its good onebut the problem is with battery backup company claim it will give battery backup of hours with case hours in single chargeadditional hours times charge via case this is misleading it only gives total hours playback ive tested it myselfit will give around hours backup on single charge of buds volumeif you only listen to music or watching videobut no call or gaming you can charge the earbuds full only times via case so additional hours if you try to charge after nd time it will only charge the buds around then it goes off after st charge the case has battery leftnd time it is down to then rd time it goes to they mentioned earbuds have mah battery each mah battery in case it is mentioned in product manualbut in boat website it is written mah instead of technically hours backup is also not possibleit has mah battery in caseit acts like a mah powerbank so let assume its efficiency is so it will give output of mahit is less than mentioned capacity due to energy loss while energy transfer now each earbud has mahso total mah now buds can be charged via case timesthats ithaving bought this for roughly i must say that im not too satisfied with the product in many ways pairing is very simple and it connects very quickly the build quality is actually very good its all plastic but it looks quite durable as long as youre not too rough with it audio is decent not too impressive my wired earphones boat bassheads are quite frankly much better this is not for gaming i play call of duty mobile and the latency is just painful even with beast mode turned on i felt no difference as the the lag still persisted the battery backup is actually great the only positive thing i can think of is the battery backup i got roughly hours of playtime and the battery had drained from to the quick charge is a cherry on topoverall id say its performance is very average definitely not worth in my opinionnot adaptive for every persons ear my wife doesnt suit the ear airdopes partially satisfied rupees i bought dont bought more than for this modelthe product was as good as i expected the quality is good noise cancellation isnt quite high but overall goodbattery lifespan i more better audio but calls are not audible properly some timesit works best for the price sound quality is good but plastic quality is averageno clear sound on call creating disturbance during call
3,its light weight good looking stability is moderate i got it for i hope it the price to be less that i bought overall nice experience to have this beautiful tableits a good product but ut has few marks on it which is not going away even after cleaning its okay for me overall its good also because my laptop is display it takes up most of the spacetable is of light weight and hope so its sturdy finishing is good with cup and mobile holder will recommend this for kids writing purposeworth for money useful for the one who wants to sit straight without bending spinal for wfh perfectkeeps falling even at a slight pushtouch unsafe to keep laptop but very good product if your basefloor is plainbrought it for rs look wise its fab very light weightbottle doesnt fits in slotreceived damaged at corner s connectors material is foam due to it stability decrease mobile stand is not adhered and packaging is worst no bubble paper no plastic wrapping presentits ok okish product at this point of priceyou can buy coz in market you get this beyond rsgood for students laptop workbut not enough strong to lift heavyweight items stability is also wellproduct is good and quality of tablei like this
4,writing this review after months of usage first about the product itself its sound quality is very good bass lovers will just love it average mids and high it lasts about hrs with a full charge also tested on heavy rain while driving dont worry earphones were not plugged in it was on my neck but there was no water ingressnow the major problem kicks in after months left speaker was not working so i registered a complaint on boat website they picked my earphone for replacement but later it was replaced with rockerz pro instead of rockerz pro why even after a lot of conversations with boat support they didnt provide me my model now ive to stick with these low quality ear peace hence try to avoid boat online support for warranty claim and better visit physical service entre good luckedit after having conversation with higher authorities on twitter they replaced the same with my model edit from first day onwards after receiving the replacement product i was in doubt that the sound quality was decreased a lot so again i replaced with the authorized service centre for flat no very low bass sound but the nd replacement is also same i thought ive some issues with my ear lol but today when i listened to my friends rockerz pro same as mine but the retail unit i was surprised and thankful too my ear was not damaged it had the same punchy bass and that signature sound which was absent from my replacement unitso i can conclude by saying the replacement product will not have that signature sound as the retail unitif anybody has experienced the same please commentthanksi would recommend it very strongly if you want a budget friendly gaming earphone sometimes may feel a lag after purchasing but after some time it works very fine but it also has some cons like the build quality my earbuds gone worn off by normal daily use as well as there rubber quality is not that much good also mic it is not that good but it is okay so it is the best earphone under your budgetif aman gupta is watching this review you may gift me a earphone thanks to amazon for such good deliverance of the products i have been using amazon for long time and amazon have truely win the trust of the customer great product and once agian thanks to amazoncharging back up is awesometh december morning ko recive hua thn december k night m charging finish huibut mene first time charge kiya to hrs se b zyada time m charge huathe product fits snugly in the ears there is some pain after prolonged use for the first weeks or so of usingbattery lasts over a day after full charge for an average uservolume is strong and so is the bass sound clarity is averageproduct is sturdy enough to use comfortably without worry of damagevery good for sound noise cancellation battery backup only fins have pain in ears sometimes otherwise its really value for moneydear siri purchased this bluetooth on april th but from august onwards not workingalso continuously iam trying to ask many shops for service at my place tiruchirapaallibut no body doing blue tooth servicealso boat rockers blue tooth having very less number of days warranty onlynow what can i do please suggestif possible please collect my bluetooth from your delivery person and do the bestcompared to my previous neckband which was realme buds wireless neo this is very good quality sound and form factor and finish also is nice
4,the product is useful and i use it daily i gave a star less because product had a small piece broken while delivery maybe but that was not a functional part thoughthe material can be bit more thick for durability overall a good buythe only issue is stability it do shakesstability should have been betterproduct is very fine in all aspects except in cost cost could have been lessvery good product in this pricenice productgood
3,when you are representing some product from a well known brand you must provide that well known build qualitythis product is designed well to grab the good looks but not the quality of the material it seems to be bad quality will not last in the longer runreason i had just started using it to hear or songs with in that time mm jack end rubber seems to be started brakingi feel that i can better quality on the platform vendors for this priceusing this earphones almost for months average sound quality performance is good bass quality average overall product is good and value for money if your looking for long term use go for itjust buck i got it look wise fine during a unboxing time i notice it broken and i try easily to fit it so i dont want to replace return it because only rs and easily fixgood product sound comes smoothly in volume leveloksuperis better is not buttonits very good at this price i need one more will plan to buy again during offer
4,best budget headphones im procured this headphones in and now is when im writing it has some prominent problems first is head adjustments get losse after year and after one and half year cushions get also strat rip off thereof third initally battery was awesome i remember that i used to use my headphone week in singal charge even whereas it always left connected over the night and start useing after wake up its my tendency i dont endow rest to devices notwithstanding this its is still alive and working as before but now it works week in singal chargeits a good product but now days many brands offer better than this at tha price rangeits a nice product mic quality is also good battery back up is goodbest part of the headphone is the battery backupits hugei love this productbut if it built to be a overheadthank you boult product of boat
3,the watch works fine good touch screen and overall features but the connectivity with smartphone is pathetic if you prefer a smartwatch which is not intended to pair with you phone then go for it it works well in all other aspectsthis was indeed an ideal purchase good performance good built up to the mark functionality at this price stable and sturdy recommend looks okहरट रट एव ऑकसजनgood for normal usersnot for heavy users like daily activitiesgood looking on handapp is not working properly some timesthe battery power is amazing its a good watch but the strap always comes outnice watch
3,it has been only month since i have bought this item so i cant comment on its durability but currently it is working perfectly sound quality is good fitting in ear is perfect which has been constantly an issue with other earphones i have used till nowi have doubt on its durability because its wires are kind of handlewithcare if it is durable then it will be among one of the best earphones i have used till nowunable to hear after monthsgood budget earphones for taking call and listening to music watching videos once in a while be careful with the wire though as it can get tangled easily and is not that strongbest buying in these rangethe c hi is a budget friendly in ear earphone and it really comes at a great pricebut the next version of these ie csi has more value for money factorslike c hi has angled mm jack whereas csi has the normal one and i am not supposed to say this but trust me csi has the best best best and superior sound quality if i compared to chithough it doesnt have a great durabilitybut if your previous earphones were csi and you are switching on these then one can definitely notice the difference between the csi and chi although you can adapt the sound of chi in nearly about week if you are switching from csito be honest the csi is literally best in all circumstances such like gaminglistening to music and professional editing the vocalsmids highs lows are perfectly balanced in csi but not chiin chi mostly when listening to sing the bass was not up to mark and the vocals were so loud that the bass was literally fading main point is that whenever we hit the full volume both of them never distorted any single beathats off to harmangood earphones short time usageits good with very clear voice and average bass clarity i am not giving stars because certain bass can be improved a bit more overall its a good onewas looking for budget earphones with voice clarity jblc hi does the work except for bass quality there nothing else to complain about
4,ordered this product for charging cables the package involved packs containing spirals however they sent all the packs containing same colours the spirals are tight for thick cables but loose for apples charging cables as they very thinvery useful product but the grip and the size of it was a bit small for my cable as it couldnt fully cover the entire part of it but nonetheless its gonna work and im glad i have it as a safety for my data cable good productgood productif u have a single charger and its expensive too then u should try this it really protect ur wiresgoodgood product value for moneyits nice but thoda length or ho sakti h size thoda chota hbest product for usb and other cables
4,got of this gb hp vw pendrives this morning review is based on testing done the same daysummarythe product is genuine and sturdy but the performance is just about average based on a random file copy performance to fill the entire spacepros cons comparing with sandisk cruiser blade gb pros solid body looks and feels great read speed is fine mbs product is genuine covered under year manufacturer warrantycons fits too tight in usb port thus causing more wear to the port and may even damage it if not used carefully capacity is gb precisely bytes not as advertised in windows itll show up as a gb drive compared to in sandisk no big deal just a technical observation write speed mbs is not bad but slightly inferior to its close competitor sandisk cruiser blade which easily gives to mbs for the same test warranty is only years compared to years on sandisk but since almost nobody claims warranty after years and besides the plastic body of sandisk gets physically damaged in years anyway so its okay for mebottomlineits good enough for casual users maybe chosen over sandisk for its look feel and sturdiness frequent users may want to look for better options with easier port fitting and better write speeddetailsthe product name is hp vw as shown on its packing the images in listing are correct while its part number is fdw so slightly confusing but both are the same thingtesting whether it is genuine or fakethe bottom of the hologram sticker on the packing has a silver layer with scratch and check written on it scratching it reveals a digit code beneath it and the right edge of the sticker has the url wwwpnycomtw to verify this code go to support product authentication page on that url that page contains instructions and explanation of the results that you may get mine were originals with the codes tested for the first time repeat test result will be a warning that the code was tested beforeso that means it is covered under year manufacturer warranty as declared by hp for aisa pacific regiondesign and build quality sturdy stylish but with a design flawit is exactly as shown in the picture the body is a solid steel case with open front and the back sealed with a black plastic cap the plastic back fits perfectly and gives it a stylish look though it may come off later the hp logo product code etc are embossed on the steel body so likely wont be erased with time overall it looks and feels great the flaw i noticed was that it takes significantly more strength to push it into the usb port compared to other usb devices like generic usb cables or usual plastic pendrives like sandisk you almost have to fight with it to push it in or pull it out this means its frequent use can wear out the usb port too soon or may even break it if not used carefullycapacity gb not will appear as gb in windowsit is advertised as a gb drive but the actual capacity is gb and yes im fully aware of the decimal vs binary calculation difference im a hardcore linux user to be precise its exact capacity is bytes on both pendrives i tested so in windows it will show up as a gb drive in linux it will show up as either gb or gib binary calculation like windows for comparison my gb sandisk shows up as bytes or gb or gib this loss of gb in a gb pendrive is no big deal for me just a technical observationperformanceread speed about mbswrite speed about mbstested with a collection of iso files ranging from about mb to gb along with a few smaller files like pdf or txt total size of the collection was about gb gibi did this testing on linux so to be fair the write performance may be slightly better on windows as it works better with fat that the pendrive comes formatted asedit no performance difference on windows either formatted as exfat on windows to make it multiboot with yumi readwrite speeds were same while copying iso files to it or reading them to load in memdisk while bootingi could do more accurate testing with tools like dd command but didnt bother as the difference usually isnt very significantupsthe product is very good i mistakenly washed it n washing machine with my pants but it is still running like new no data loss problem or data corrupt problems i have faced yetdownsthe only downside is this pendrive is little slow because of technology is newer oneand second one is not affact your data at all the silver paint on pendrive is vanishing time by time and it is now turning blackproduct is good but slowstorage is good but doesnt work for car stereo gb out of so far so goodgood productok
4,the mouse is decent for its price of i dont usually use windows im using this on my linux os and its works fine on arch linux so im sure it will work fine on any debianbased distro as wellfirst impression the size is a bit smaller so it will take time to get used to it the scroll wheel is little wobbly buttons travel of the button is bit too much considering its small form factori will update my review after using iti have been searching for this kind of small mouse which is very handy to use value for moneyjust good as in this price rangethis is nice product in low costgiven price better one definitelylittle oneoverall good productits easy to use

3,this is my first product from boult i wanted a wired earphone and when i searched on amazon i found boult in such a low price and i ordered it recieved it todaychecked it by connecting to my phone and i was surprised by the audio quality this is a nice product in this price range and the mic is also good the build quality is average and you cant complain considering the price it also has a clip to attach the earphone to your shirt like the good old nokia days it has total pair or ear tips in a zipper packet and already attached to the earphone the manufacturing date is march so its quite new actually not an old stock it also has that antislip ear hook which is an added advantage in general it is a good product for this pricei was looking for reliable bluetooth earbuds on a budget and settled on these personally i am pleased with them i have been using them for almost four months now including one month when they saw around hours of use per daypros comfortable elegant and sober appearance reasonable battery life i would let the earbuds recharge at for example mealtimes decent range going a few meters into the next room with a concrete wall in between was no issue the battery status of the dock is shown by a series of led blinks simple and practicalcons mediocre phone calling quality in particular the microphone the few conversations i had using these went successfully so this was not a deal breaker but the clarity was not the best for surethe touch controls were initially a drawback for me but i got used to them also this product does not come with a charger either charge off of your computer or buy a charger with the recommended electrical output as for the sound quality it is acceptable not superlative i have listened to music and i have watched films and youtube videos with no problemas a final note i prefer this type of earbud over the inear type because i find it more hygienic wiping with a clean cloth after each use and leaving the lid of the dock open for some time should help to slow fungal growthvery good product nicely fits in the ear and comfortable the volume seems to be a little low at the highestbut a good buysound quality is good everything is balanced but bass dominance is too high and couldnt hear the treble and other notesvery good bass quality and worth for money earphones i ever buy also product quality is awesome it doesnt fit as snugly in my ears maybe it is cause of greasy ears but the product is good highly recommendedbolte audio bass is very good

4,im using this mouse from more than months now and its working greatbut the only problem i faced is the big size of itit looks like the old ball mouse which is quite big in sizegood for gaming by the wayworking goodby far the best mouse ive used writing this after days suits well for daily use could be a tad bit bigger been using this mouse for the last years both in office and at home suits my hand the best tried some gaming mouse at range but the feel is not good and my wrist starts to hurt on those cheap mice this one is the father of all mice in that sense as it ticks all the boxes for me obviously you cant expect some god like gaming performance but its decent and for everything else its the bestitem is good no issuesits really worthwhilea bit short in height clicks and scroll good for home and office useeasy to use rough lasts for years affordable
4,note its ready to go mic which doesnt need any sound card and can be plugged and used directly even with smartphones has mm jack connector built in you can use connector if needed it has very long cable which measures upto feet so note that it has absolutely no noise isolation and normal smartphone earphones does better job of noise reduction compared to them in stock condition but with simple editing this mic works just fine check the review below for detailed settings there are literally thousands of review on this product but none explained the best possible settings for it when used with smartphone with audacity software or even in general so i took the risk of ordering it and it turned out to be nightmare right out of the box as the sound output was worse than my smartphone earphones so i went to search for best settings on amazon other sources but in vain fortunately i myself in experiments found the solution and now its working just finefirst i am mentioning all the pros and cons considering the settings that i found and then listing those settingspros built quality of the complete mic and cable is good for the price given length of cable is insane feet i personally didnt find it useful as i use it with my smartphone which is just couple of feet below in my pockets but for some users it can be very useful if using in rig setup with camera has universal mm jack which is handy its easy to use just plug and play device which doesnt need any sound card or external device to work has support for multiple device right from smartphones to dslrs and computers it comes with carry pouch which is very handy since its a mess with such long cablescons biggest con is the sound quality right out of the box its just garbage quality and even normal ears cant bear the background noise collection so forget about audiophiles my normal smartphones earphones record much better sound quality compared to this length of cable is way too much for me and i guess for many users i think there should have being multiple option on length to choose from as keeping feet cable wrapped and hanging or in pocket while recording is not comfortable it comes with a button cell for recording sound for devices other than smartphone and theres no way to know whether the battery is dead or whats its charging level only way to check is by plugging it to a digital recorder or computer and test so if you are carrying it with recorder which doesnt has playback feature or if you are in hurry and in case of dead battery to record all the sound then only way to find that your efforts are in vain will be when you comfortably sit to edit it and trust me its very frustrating i am mentioning it as this scenario have happened with me once hence i am very cautious about batteries now use it with smartphones or digital recorders i think price should have being couple of hundred bucks less considering the sound qualitybest setting using audacity software these are the settings when you record with smartphone or any other device and there are lots of background noises and you use audacity software which is free open the software and open the audio file you recorded with this mic select entire audio clip and open effects and then distortion start the playback of audio clip in the software so you can listen to change in effects that you are about to makenow select distortion type option on the top of box and select soft clipping or select hard limiter and do the settings as it sounds suitable to you take the clipping level cursor to extreme right end or so until you hear soft pleasant output adjust the makeup gain cursor little bit if needed i keep it on here you can select which ever type which you feel is suitable for you now just click apply now is noise reduction for that select short section of audio which does not have your voice but only has background noises that you dont want open effects and then noise reduction click on get noise profile now select entire audio clip and again open effects and then noise reduction finally click on ok and thats it now you are good to go with soft slightly lesser noises and more pleasant sound output after these steps you can amplify the sound from same software or any other end user softwareverdict i personally am very disappointed with the sound quality though the audacity tweaking gets it to bearable level but its satisfactory enough plus price seems slightly more on this i wouldnt recommend these are someone looking good sound quality specially if you live in noisy environment buy this only if you live in very silent conditionsits not great or best out there for beginners but goodi use a budget midrange phone and the boya mic is better than in built mic of phone record it in wav format its goodyou gotta use softwareapps to pull the best of this like audacity or some other editing appits pretty long and thats good as you can extend the cable to a good distance say if u r connecting it to the camera on a tripodoverall its decent for beginners i see highend phones have good recording capabilities but if you have a budget phone then this one is dealmicrophone looks very well built it supports both phones and cameras there are some phones that does not support external mic please check before buying as one of my phone did not support itthey claim noise cancellation however i did not notice major difference it also captures great amount of noise only cancellation is because of foam padding around the microphone i could not observe noise cancellation at least while recording on phoneoverall package is well bundled wire quality is decent however the dongle quality is excellent even the small clip to hold the microphone feels solidwire is to long but good if quality of wire is improve in future then stars from me but now star good sound low price star for wire quality but over all a nice producti think its good for online teaching like i dobut yeah some problems like very long cable length i mean someone might need but it should be optional or detachable price of the mic itself is not much anywaysi am okay with this mic for sometime until i am sure i need quality rode mic to upgradedont expect noice cancellation under this budget but audio recording quality is very goodnice productdecent

4,recieved damaged product the first time the seller is very good and quickly replaced it for a new one go for bassheads if you are spending this much they are charging more for the metal enclosure and the braided cable the angled jack is a plus but the sound quality is soso infinity zip and their own bassheads are way better for soundi would like to start by saying im not an audiophile therefore my review will be less about the audio quality of the product and more about the over all experience regarding the product first off this is my second time buying the product and you guessed it its good enough that i will buy it a third time if need beupon unboxing we are greeted by the presence of pair of extra ear buds there is also a pair of ear fins in the packet containing the extra ear buds these ear fins are used to keep the ear buds snugly in your ears during strenuous periods of use where there is a chance of lots of movement more on this latercoming to the ear phones itself its among the very few ear phones that genuinely feels premium in hand it is very durable specially the plug part that connects to your phone many a time my ear phones stop working because the plug part malfunctions and causes problems in the functioning of the ear phones this is not the case with thesethe wire itself is made of rubbersilicon it feels good in hand and the only thing i can think of that could be improved here is to braid the wire but so far the wire hasnt showed any form of wear and tear common with most other ear phone wires another thing to emphasize is that the entire cable is flat through out this genuinely decreases the number of instances where i find myself trying to untangle the wire this is truly one of the best features of this pair of earphonesremember i said something about the ear phones being made completely of metal well it continues to the mic and the left and right splitter both these pieces feel very premium because of the signature cold feeling of metal against skin i dont know about you but attention to small details like this always brings smiles to my face it is to be noted that the mic piece is a universal single button type and hence cannot control volume personally this problem didnt affect me much but the might be potential buyers who might find this to be a deal breakermic quality is subject to individual bias therefore i can tell you my personal experience in my opinion i feel that the quality is average it wont blow anyones mind but it will deliver most of the time a common complaint i heard from most of my callers that they find it difficult to hear me when there is a significant amount of back ground noise or wind rustling in to the mic these are common issues even with ear phones price significantly higher than the boat bassheads finally the most important part of the review the sound quality of the ear phones as i said earlier i wont be going into the technical details i am a bass lover and that is what led me to buy this pair in the first place in my opinion i found that the bass is indeed good but not over powering for the average consumer like how the extra bass versions of the sony line up of earphones trend to be the volume gets sufficiently high and more often than not i use it at less than half its total volume when listening to music the clarity of the boat bassheads are above par and easily betters even ear phones in the inr price category this is one other reason why i love this pair so much a point to remember as the entire covering of the ear phones is made of metal it is significantly heavier than other ear phones this becomes a double edged sword on the one hand the metal makes the ear phones feel very premium but it also makes it significantly heavier than other earphones made of plastic this causes it to easily fall out of your ears if the supplied fins are not used the find unlike the ones find in lets say the newer bose ear phones arent as comfortable and can hurt your ears if used over a prolonged timelast but not the least there are multiple color variants of the boat bassheads including red black and blue i found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be a personal opinion but i find it to be the best of the three that said i do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is a neutral color this leaves out the red for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at a lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales therefore if you are short on cash and just want a great pair of ear phones then grab these while they lastpros no metal build excellent wire quality and trendy durable above average sound qualitycons metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily supplied fins are uncomfortable to wear over a prolonged time supplied clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easilyi hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the bassheads all suggestions are welcomethanking you dwarakeshbest quality i like boat earphone saund qualityonly disadvantage i noticed was this cant be use in usb phones mm jack is provided so it can be usedin jack phones only nicegoodi used this headphone for travel very lite and easy to carry in pocket colourful sound quality is good the wire is thin so i feel cautious while taking it from bag or pocketgd one only thing is coverssleeves comes out easily if not gd fit however additional coverssleeves are provided
4,the sound quality is amazing but you have to be very careful while using it as the wire from the earplugs to the controller seems very delicate one negative point is that the noise cancellation sucksgreat bass and noice overall awesome and build quality is very slickits obviously not the best earphone out there but certainly does its job for the price you wont miss out on much just a bit of bassgreat buy thoughvalue for money decent build quality and looks best product at this price rangenice value of the producti like thisits best quality and good for thi renge

4,initially the pendrive i got was getting very hot when inserted and without doing anything but then i applied for exchange and the second time i got a pendrive it just gets little bit warm and is much better than first time i had called sandisk for first pendrive and they asked me ask for replacement so i did and second time ive got good pendrive go for itbest quality and value for moneyworking good percent good percent badheating very fast because of the metal body i guesskind of slowbuilt quality is goodsince its metal the build quality is great but causes heating issue when transferring files for longer periods of time otherwise performs as expectedit is best pendrive at this prize and speed is good i suggest u can buy without any worrythe quality of pen drive is absolutely good as expected but yes as other customers mentioned in comments about the heating issue yes it heats up but only when its actually in use means while transfers or hardcore use of pendrive but when left idle its completely normal i forgot the pendrive attached until afternoon but it was completely normal no heating issue once the transfer was doneaverage
4,as i browsed various multiple earphones in this range on a notsobusy workday break i came across this very featurepacked product it seemed interesting and had something called dirac opteo in it anc so i thought id give it a shotfirstday impressions its blown me awayexhaustive list of impressions dirac opteo balanced sound with punchy bass yeah and not booming bass its so great and im quite surprised it sounds like something youd expect at a higher price point soundstage as soon as the headphone is switched on it starts in battery saving mode once you turn on dirac opteo mode you can literally feel the space opening up all the instruments feel individual and sound separated fireflies by owl city sounds lovely and all the strings sway in the centre while the various zaps and buzzes surround you its really great for the price treble and mids clean and clear the bass doesnt overpower them and feels just right the vocals come out clearly and all the instruments dont interfere with it drive home by steven wilson sounds great bass punchy and tight i love how it fizzles in bonfire by knife party and how it reverberates in turn down for what by dj snake breakin a sweatby skrillex zedd sounded tight and i discovered how well produced it is lovers of tight bass this is your product volume it gets really loud so loud that i cant listen to it at the highest setting but if thats your thing then you should know that the highs get pretty shrill at the setting but the bass is still pretty clean and loud anc anc is present but wont drown everything out its a great add on but if youre looking for a headphone to make all sounds around you zero then this wont do that if you need to drown out some noise while you listen to your tunes this will do the trick ambient sound mode the opposite of anc it pulls in the outside noise to let you have a conversation again you cant blast tunes at high volume and still have a convo but you can listen with lower volume near volume and hear things around you if the ambient sound also increased as i increased volume it would have been amazing calling did a couple of calls with nonoise the other person said i sounded great i took a couple of calls in a local grocery store was pretty loud and the other end had no issue hearing me buttons the button placement is easy and i didnt feel any issue getting used to the controls the simple manual explains everything in mins so read once and youre good to go to note the sound is best in dirac opteo mode every time you turn it on you have to double press the multi function button to turn it on id have loved having it on by default also every time i turn it on it plays a second tune which could have been shorter imagine hearing it every time you turn the thing on ugh connectivity once i connected it to my phone the first time it connects to my phone within seconds of turning the earphones on battery it seems to last long ive been using them for about hrs and its gone down about cannot say anything more yet though when you take both the earphones out of your ears it doesnt auto pause like some of the competitors annoyed that this was missed would have saved so much more battery if they did this build quality i have a black version its made with good quality plastic and didnt feel heavy around my neck it doesnt have metal anywhere and its quite simple i think it looks decent exercise need to test will update laterin summary an easy recommendation if you can overlook the small issues theres a great sounding featurepacked and long lasting device here at a great price would definetely recommendfirst i was bit sceptical about the build quality but have to say its got a pretty sturdy material and decent quality buttons bass is good vocals are much clearer in crystal bionic mode anc is working to a degree will definitely cancel out the noise of your celing fan but dont except any more than that no issues with call enx is working upto its name battery is sufficient around hours if you mix up the modes overall a decent all rounded neckband jack of all and king of noneall other things such as sound quality battery backup are very good but multiple device pairing is implemented very poorly if i connect with laptop and try to connect with phone at same time it does not work many times if headphones are connected to laptop and you close the laptop without shutting it down then you wont be able to connect with phone again unless and until you disconnect with laptop this is a big bug please fix thisthis boat anc neckband is very good but needs improvement and fixespros nice sound quality while using crystal bionic sound but its average on normal mode which feels a little more bassy and losses clarity at certain points great build quality its anc ambience mode is good in this price range its quite comfortable to wear for long sessions as per my ear fitting it has dual pairing which is very good but its not very seamless and there is a small issue with dual pairing eg while receiving a call on one device the audiovideo being played at another device wont pause you have to manually pause instead there wont be any sound output through that device its a little issue but it would have been great if the video gets paused while receiving a call on another device as this is available on boat rockerz and a few different boat neckbandscons its range is very low considering bluetooth v i even have boat neckband with v which has better range even a single wall coming in between ms can block the sound output its battery life is average which needs charge every day if you use it for roughly hours everyday with bionic crystal modeanc enabled while using dual pairing sometimes there are sound drops and lags in between and the sound gets high pitched and starts lagging sometimes if you switch quickly between devices this happened on the replacement unit i received maybe its not the case with your unit sometimes no sound is received while playing audio from both devices i dont know if its wrong with my unit or every unitoverall this is a good and considerable neckband under k if you want good bassrich sound quality ancambience mode and descent battery lifebut if your requirements mostly is dual pairing then this is not for you as i bought this considering dual pairing feature most importantly but its not really seamless in between devices but still its the best possible available feature in this price range or even under k but it needs improvements and fixes to make it more seamless and efficientanother problem with dual pairing is that the media doesnt gets paused on first device if theres a call on the second one which is already there on boats few other neckbands but then there is no mediapause feature on them eg if audio is being played on devices first device audio will get paused if audio is played on second device and viceversaso do try it out by yourself because its my personal experience with the neckband maybe you get a better experiencethanks for reading happy shoppingbought this one after using rockerz pro for over years now comparing this with that that one was ergonomically better felt snug in earsstandalone review of this noise cancellation is just alright not too great not too bad sound quality is definitely great and excellent with the bionic sound feature kudos on that part bass quality is fairly good at this price point holds charge for as long as advertised overall bulky nature of the neckband puts you off and then the finish is poor too around the control buttons making it look very tacky cheap atleast on the funky grey one which i bought because it was priced lowestconclusiongood product at a fair price ie nothing too great but nothing bad either
4,it is very easy to usegood and easy to useoverall built is good but button quality is very poor if you have more then i suggest you to go with fx es classic its much better choice than thisnice productrecommended from entering collegelikeamazon very good experience excellent all function under one segmentso i like iti sey for all engineering student u purchase only this because this is the best for your problemthis is a solution understandvery good

4,sound of song are good its really good or i am still using almost maybe or month maybe more but they still goodproduct is in good quality and comfortably fixed in our ears but the major issue is when we were buds for few minutes it will start hurting our earsiam satisfied with the sound quality ok with the noise cancellation performancebut when it comes to bass quality it is some what less than the boat not too much low clarity in the bass is some what missing light weight when compared to boat finally boat is good at its price rangemic sound quality crystal clear bass is also good and the wiring quality is very good overall earphone is very good in this range worth hai product mebought them months ago no other complains so far everything going greatbut are little overpriced for nicebastgaming nicesoundosmdisyannice and value for moneythank you amezon
3,review written on it is a nice little tripod for your phone mini camera or gopro it has rubber grips which makes it anti slip on flat surfaces and feels sturdy in your handhere are few pros and cons u should know before buying proslight weight and easy to assemblevery good for small devicesstability is superbcomes with bluetooth remotequality of rubber and plastic is great conssize is quite small it looks little bigger in the images shown not at all suitable for big dslr cameras or video cameras i think that the rotaion of the balls can become loose after several months of use ill update herefinal verdict for the price of it is a good product as it is quite useful when you vlog or want to take group photos it will easily carry your mobile phones and small cameras but dont even think of mounting your professional camera on it it is very small compared to big camerasgo for it its a great producti basicly purchased it to record timeplace video but when i recieved it i was surprised because it was soo good at a less and affordable price but i gave it stars because of the bluetooth remote as it was unable to click photos and i even changed the battery but it didnot workedproduct is very good as compare to the pricepersonal opinion a little bit quality of the material with a bit more size could have been improvedgood but could be more bettercant take mobile weightneed to adjust stand every time for single clickthis tripod is a good purchase pretty standard quality i must say bluetooth remote also works perfectly not very suitable for hefty dslr cameras good for mobile phones and vloggingi m use this product from year no complainlearning needed

3,update now after this review they have told me to give them atleast a star review just to even consider arranging for the replacement not even guaranteed now lets see if they actually do as promisedoriginal review after months it stopped working so raised a request for it but i have to courier it to them cost rs then they found that it was a problem with the pcb they changed it ok good but they replaced it with the pcb of probass which is an older and lower priced model when i shared them the screenshots and asked them for an explaination they just asked it to be couriered back paying for their mistake no reimbursment no quality suppport no resposnse to emails apart from the standard script one of the most regretted purchasethe product is a looking good but not a good sound quality and then packaging is a very poor i think people open the product when it is packaged for that the package is cut and things are differenti think that these companies make people think a little spare eartips were missing from the package i received so that was disappointingsound quality is good for the priceenc is decentthe eartips are excellently designed so the earphones fit well you can run without any issuesit doesnt feel stuffy into the eari already have a bose qc and sennheiser bt headset but was looking for light neckband headphones for the convenience it offers and i am really satisfied with thisgood buy over all i would recommend to go for itconnecting only one devicegetting off after minutewhatsapp incoming call not working proper caller couldnt hear receiver voicei have issue in this product one side is not working so please look into thisgoodgood
4,product is good and i like that performance is good its working good nice product its worthable for this ratethe wireless mouse is working well there is one problem those who start using the mouse have to switch on and they should switch off when their work over if they forget to switch off which can happen to many users the battery may get drained the manufacturer should find another method in the place of the onoff switchscroller movement is not goodit is best useful mouse bcoz wireless mouse for work from my shopi am csc shopper so its need to me so smooth work for laptop or pc thank and again thanks for amazon delivery servicesthis wireless mouse is very smoothly working thank you so muchgood product worked fineits good and very handythe mouse is easy to use but i expected a little bigger mouse at this price range
3,update after monthsupdate the problem mentioned in the earliest review is becoming more and more dire with time now right earbud gets discharged in hour and a half whereas left one keeps going so reducing one star will contact them for replacement and update hereupdate called service center they asked to bring it but am lazy i expected theyd replace at home paid more attention towards the issue above the stable situation is that just after full charge right bud can go upto hrs but left one always goes for mins more and the difference is more if there is a standby of a day or two when the left one loses juice rapidly it seems so i guess i can still use the buds but with certain restrictions will happily restore stars if the issue stays stable for next monthsupdate after monthsno change in quality still the pack charges the buds like a boss during this period they were once kept in mouth by my infant nephew for over half an hour very dangerous thankfully he couldnt swallow them full of saliva and whatnot and on another occasion i threw one of my earbuds on the floor with full force undisclosed depressing reason due to which the touch panel with the logo got detached which i then reattached after all this buds are still rocking with same sound quality as on day i think these are pretty darn sweet deals lack of volume control etc etc is all forgiven happy customer although the issue of left earbud discharging earlier than right persistsoriginal reviewusing for last monthsi am an audiophile and also an instrumentalist but i hadnt used any tws yet so wanted to dip my toes and didnt want to invest much but also not something throwaway so settled for boult no boat etc due to their highly adultered sound signature since i have previous experience with it i like my music flat at studio quality more recently ive been using a low cost headphones with mindblowing performance oneodio pro go ahead and search it it is really one of a gem for all those purist sound fanscoming to this twsconnectivity right out of the box only left one was working after connecting to my iphone maybe right one didnt pair correctly to left did that reset thing as suggested which also took some effort but after that both started working and since then no issues i am using both my phone and laptop linux ofcourse you need to disconnect one to use another but perfect connectivity now i can move around in my sqft apt and no connection loss which is greatcall quality is decent faced no disconnects yet and the other party is also ok with my voice but you cannot talk in a hushed voice you always need to speak up in a medium volume to let the other party understand youfeatures tapping is oddly sensitive i mean it responds even if i am adjusting the bud and not touching the central area but surprisingly takes a decent tap punch to playpause i can get used to that though one thing track aage peeche is ok but these dont have anything which can control the volume bummed on thatbattery decent backup its been nearly months i use buds on an average of hours daily and i just had to charge the main case just times in an emergency i also used it to charge my iphone which it did really quickly i was happy to see that one weird thing to notice is that the right earbud always discharges more quickly than the left infact i can use the left one mins more that the right but anyways i put them both in the case once any one of them starts to complain of low batterysound qualitybass frequencies very decent bass surprisingly great low bass songs like the humma song i wanna love you sound pretty good but a bit lacking in other frequencies of bass lut gaye by jubin doesnt sound that punchy as it should for a flat signature overall for the most part you should be fineother frequencies ill review this from vantage point of studio quality signature for mids the spectrum is tilted towards bit of high bass but surprising absence of very specific high bass frequencies as mentioned above but its bearable for highs initially i felt the presence a bit lacking which takes away that warmth and fidelity from a few tracks but after using it for a few days i started feeling alright in that aspect maybe some burn in god knows also remembering that i paid just bucks for these i mostly will be using these while my walking and workout sessions so i think my mind wont be nitpicking then ill soon be upgrading thoughoverall really a very decent purchase with good sound quality provided you can get these for under k cheershey this one item has a built quality is like a stoneand also the working condition and sound quality it is marvelous but only one problem is the noise cancellation that not working properly which means when we are in a crowded area while recording something or a call to another person the unwanted noises are coming they cannot hear properly our voice thats the only disadvantage on this oneright buds not performs well i am trying to change music to next but it still plays the same which should not happen according to manualbeen using these for a month now cant massively complain the sound quality is decent enough may not be good enough for big music heads not enough bass and provides good noise isolation very impressed by the battery life with the charging case and i use it every day if you can snag it on a deal for bucks its a fantastic dealmy only issue is we cant change the connection to devices by click every thing else is finebest at price and require some button for operationcall pick up rejection function next song play function not working on single touchproduct is good but battery not as expected

4,very bad performance even for normal work even this model is not mentioned under their official websitetried many times to contact customer care no responsegood product but pekeging not good am not reviewing this as per gaming experience but per daily heavy usei find it very helpful for me who use mouse whole day with a lot of left and right clicks drag and drops scrolls and scroll clicks i didnt find any glitches so far works perfectly for meabout looks it looks beautiful almost like a small pet who can change colour but it can be a little disturbing if you are using it in dark otherwise the best thing is it doesnt need any installation headachesonly reason i deducted one star is because this mouse is a little oversized for my hand so people with little hands will struggle at first but eventually with time and use you will feel like it shranki like zebronics because i trust their productsif you are thinking of buying it go for ita good mouse not the best but good enoughgoodits good but idk if its only with me but the mouse sometimes becomes unresponsive not for long tho just seconds overall would recommendgood mouse little heavyweight
4,its worth itat this price the product is very nice and easy to use for beginners also kids love and enjoy while working these wonderful acrylic colorsi ordered these to use for painting wooden ornaments with my year old niece and her friend i was pleasantly surprised because the price was good for what i received these are glass jars and full to the top we were able to pour out little drops onto paper plate palettes and there is a lot of paint left the paint mixed well to make custom colors this paint would also work well for lots of craft projects including painting art pictures on paper on rocks or tshirts toogood productits quality is very high and very good for kidsalso its really cheap i used it on a canvas i liked how the colors are vibrant and uniquelove the colours easy to use and are waterproofthe quality is good good deal at this price
4,mousepad is sturdy enough doesnt move around a lot the print is a bit rough expect this much smoothness at this price point overall decent product will get your job donein hand texture is good may not be good for gaming as it feels little brisk after using it directly on table not sure it will be like that itself or its my experiencecorners should be stitched but overall its the best quality in this price value buyi like it smooth and cool and the bottom is made up of rubber which prevents it from moving while the mouse moves its great value for money easy and smoothi want to return my order
4,case is hard and spacioushard disc and other pandrive cables etc you can put easily it is good to safety and storagefit product for palm size hard drivesvalue for money purchasequality is good looking is nice light in weightgood product in this price segmentbest for this priceok ok product but with comparison to price good producti recommend you to buyit is amazing that we are not manufacturing such a thing in india

that not punchybut dont you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy basethe call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone these earphones have noise cancellation which works goodthe volume level on these earphones are really highi cannot go beyond alright so i have been using boult probass curve for over a month and would like to summarize my feedback in bulletpoints to make it easy for the prospective buyers i was thinking to buy a quality bluetooth headset with a great performance at an affordable price for quite long and this is where my search ended i was quite fed up of using cheap wired headsets as they used to go out of function or get snapped every now and then moreover i found them getting entangled every other second making it really inconvenient to handle especially while travelling its that time i started feeling the need of a wireless headset and began my search i took good time months to look for a good product and this is when i decided to purchase this item before purchase i devoted time to read the users reviews that i always do before making any purchasesmall or big and found myself convinced finally i decided to go for it ok so no more essay writing let me get straight to the key points i bought this for under sale so saved inr its a good saving as warrent buffet says every penny saved is every penny earned this has great sound quality i could not compare it against any other product because i dont have any other bluetooth headset with me but this will surely not let you down it is very loud even at volume level you just cannot listen to at that level forget about full volume bass is great but not outstanding to be honest but it does not disappoint either good thing is the sound does not distort even if you raise it to excellent sound clarity i am not a technocrat so cannot tell what are the characteristics of noise cancellation feature but you will not get to hear any external soundnoise or very very minimal that is not noticeable so this stands perfect at this point performs excellent while taking a call you will a get a crystal clear voice when you maketake a call using this device you will feel as if you are making calls directly from the mobile phone in fact its even better at times when the voice from the other side is low i really love the handsfree calling because i have to take long calls with the clients in my job battery backup is excellent it can last anywhere from to hours i have tested it rigorously in both audio and video usage and i mean it i tested it for almost a month with daywise log capture please see the detailed tracking at the end it gets full charged in hours approx bluetooth range is good it covers a distance of to feet easily its quite enough if not good enough my figures may be wrong beware its just my rough estimate havent tested is rigorously design looks good and is very convenient to wear the wires are adjustable as per need this is a nice thing looks cool when you wear it around your neck i chose red color last but not the least it comes with year replacement warranty so you can sleep peacefully while enjoying your favorite music judgement just go for it if you have a limited budget or dont want to spend a fortune on bluetooth headset i was hesitant to spend anything beyond bucks on a bluetooth headset it was my personal limitationps battery

purchase a headphone i recommend for this one under rupees best oneno battery backup and no flexible to use they dont satisfied with provided featuresi am writing this review after used of days the product is really very good sound quality durability battery performance is also very goodoverall its a fair productrs with all the featuresits perfect for daily commute since it has a very good battery life it will last for to days easilywhen it comes to the sound quality i feel its not delivering as advertised which is obvious it would be wrong to expect great sound from an overall product you cant have everything at once this is my personal opinion since i am a music enthusiast and have experienced music from great headphones and ear phonesother than that its worth trying totally recommend this product if you daily travel for work and you are looking for a budget wireless earphonesound quality is not besti liked this product already using since few days battery back is also very good
4,goodi use this to solve my numericals and its goodexcellent tool for kids in learninga quality productgood productproduct is amazing and less weight good use of it and u can go for itgood
3,stand is good but the light is not that bright in photos it feels bright but irl not that use of the lightalso setting up the light and stand takes bit of effortquality of stand and parts is average i bought it for rs but i wont recommend u guys to pay even a rupee more than rs for itgood producti liked it as it is easy to use and helpful in clicking better pictureseasy to handleworthygreat product for beginnersgoodlight quality is really good at this price segmenti really liked its portability as we can take this to another place easily
4,nice portable liked itreducing one star as packaging was not goodmouse is bigif you prefer small and travel friendly mice go for someother designthe mouse looks good and it is even easy to hold and use due to to its design the only issue i found out was with the battery port the cover for the battery doesnt come off easily and thats the worst part also the battery cover has some opening provided not sure whyok worthygood productgood deal but big sizenoisy while scrollingat st they send me a used one with missing adapter than replaced with a new one previously i was using logi m fullsize mouse its wheel stopped working properly within a year thats why i bought this fullsize wireless mouse hp x with years warrenty clicks are soft on logi also they have increased the price of it from to but there is no use if it doesnt work properly lets see
4,i used this product for about months and really had no issues with it until i noticed that my internet stopped working after getting it checked i found out that the issue was in the ups maybe wiring cable which stopped transmissioni contacted the customer care and i was assisted by mr ankit he was very helpful and asked me to demonstrate the issue in video and tried to ascertain the issue through other checkups too after ascertaining that the issue is in the product he confirmed to get the default product replaced and started the issue and informed me on tentative timelines for the same hoping to receive the replacement soon so that i can continue uninterrupted internet i have been using this product for the past four months during this tenure i had faced no issues initially but roughly after months the power back up started shrinking extremely and the least duration was under minutes thats when i contacted the customer support via whatsapp and i must say the whole experience with the customer support team was simply surprising they were very polite and helpful throughout the process it was very easy for me to explain the issue to them then at the end of the first conversation itself they arranged a replacement for the product since it is just months old they took all the responsibility of the issue and sent me a new product which i am currently using now the back up i am getting is hours which is based on my usageso finally i am not sure how often i buy a product from this brand but i will never forget the support i received from this this brand cheersi purchased the product days back and initial product was not working properly but i received a replacement for that thanks for immediate response from the support team i liked oakter because its indian product and not a chinese as of now its working fine and no lag in wifi connection or speed need to test the recharge capacity when the power goes off will keep you updated after a month again by checking the results giving stars as of nowthis is a really good option for those who are primarily concerned about being cut off from online meetingscalls due to frequent short term power cuts and are not willing to spend more amount buying an inverter i have been using this product since around months and am pretty happy with its backupi have been using the product for more than a year later i purchased a second product for my parents home and it was working fine for months however the backup battery stopped working later and the customer support team were quick to respond and swiftly sent me the replacement productproduct was delivered very promptly and packaging was good using this product just from couple of days and its working as expected very easy to plug use reserving star for longevity of this product will revise my rating after a year or so depending on my experiencethe device doesnt support for hours it support only for or hours minutes max on full rechargeproduct is affordable light and good please dont fool on hours support capacity resonate ups is better as compared to thisthis product claims to give backup for upto hours but it wont even give backup for mins i claimed warranty and got the new product as well still the same problem they reiterate and say upto hours where they shud mention clearly that it will give backup upto hour not more than thatone of the worst customer support services i have seen the associates keep repeating the same sentence or copy paste the chat and dont provide solutions totally disappointed and waste of money never recommending anyone to buy their product
4,my isp provided modemrouter combo is in another location in the house and i was getting speed drops on ghz when i was across the house as was expected so i decided to buy this router to use as an access point the setup is pretty straightforward provided you know what you are doingas is mentioned on the product page this router comes with two modes router mode and access point mode if you are using it in addition to your isp provided modemrouter i would suggest using it in the access point mode onlythe range and the speeds are working better than i expected for the price certainly better than the router that the isp provides the router does come with a lan cable but the quality of the cable is not very confidence inspiring the leds on the front can be configured via the tether app to switch off at specific times which is a neat feature apart from that i have found tether app to be pretty useless it doesnt specify the device identity for some reason just shows the ip and unknown until you rename the device yourself sometimes it doesnt even list all the devices connected i guess it is better to use the router settings from the browser itself if you want to dig into the settingsi would like to add one more thing in the end this router looks pretty slick and i dont think it has gotten enough credits for that kept on the table or even hung from the wall it looks and feels premium for the price and that is in addition to all the amazing features it hasrouter gets sometime auto disconnected even though it is connected to interneti dont have any issue with router but sure with amazon packaging method bcz no paper bag or anything were used it was only the boxgood product for that price good rangeso far everything looks good will update the review after a few months of usageawasome experience go for it with out any hasitation assistance also very goodhighly recommended to purchase overall a good purchase you will never regrate after purchasing itsignal strength can be improved furtherso far good to go
4,the product was received without damaged and seal intact coming on to the product i bought the jazzy blue sunburn editionprosbattery is good used as opened from the pack it held good for about hours across days and still charge is leftsound sensible bass and good mids as well as lows not that i can discern between themaux availablethe ear cups are quite big hence sorta provides passive noise isolationconsnot foldable as well as type b charger usb micro typebeing a limited edition if your ear cups wear off very miniscule chances of replacing it with suitable colorif a person is of hot body typeemits heat or more warm then normal there is higher chances of feeling warmth in your ears as i heard the material just reflects the heat back on to ears thats just plain uncomfortable to mealso the build feels very flimsy and plastickyalso a major drawback i felt was that whenever we switch onoff we get the builtin audiobought it for now after years months today it broke after months of use the red coating started peeling off but device showed no problems sound is clear balanced not very hogh but enough bass good battery backup charges faster aux is available disadvantage is you cant fold it planning to buy it again as i think this the best in segment now the rate has increased to the first thing i want to say is that the headphone is really bulky i didnt notice the first few days of using but eventually it gives pain on the shoulder if worn for a longer period of time hours sound quality is good do not have any bass anc is not present in this headphone its a decent headphone for casual purposes if youre a music lover or wear your headset for longer period of time then i think you should invest in other options which is light weight and have anc in themeverything is great about boat products delivered in two daysnoise cancelling is great bluetooth connectivity is good something it takes time to connect if you planning to buy then this would be a great choicein details it was written that it has physical noise isolation feature in it but when it came i didnt observe as such feature i bought it for study purpose that the reason why i was looking for such feature but i found it as a waste of moneysometimes sound doesnt work you have to decrease the volume to zero and then increase again to hear the sound bu this happens only out of timesbuild quality is good has physical noice isolation soft padded comfortable but bass could be quite better otherwise everything is finebest for gym study online lectures entertainment etcplease go for it good quality headphones in over the ear category good quality sound but has less bass as other says but its decent good mic quality for meetings but doesnt have any noisecancellation feature i just feel that after hours of constant use these earphones feel weighted to the neck

distinguish between by touch alonexiaomi mi earphones performancexiaomi claim that the mi earphones feature a rd generation balanced damping system that creates a transparent sound and metal sound chambers created via a step process marketing fluff aside how do the earphones really sound simply put surprisingly decent for earphones that cost less than a nice dinner for twowhile most earphones in this price range have overinflated bass that dominates the rest of the frequency range the bass response on the mi earphones is controlled and restrained it doesnt overwhelm the sound signature or smother the highs that said bassheads will be left slightly wantingits surprising to hear that highs are present and distinct in the sound mix although they do get overpowering sometimes the mids are slightly repressed which is evident in vocalheavy genres such as blues while the clarity on offer is decent for the price songs with many layers of instrumentation do sound muffled and noisy this is most evident in complex genres such as rock and metal in which the earphones sound harsh and the mids get buried by the treble and bassthis earphone set is fantastic and highly deserving of money i used it for a while last in and now im buying it once more in in my perspective the mi headset has good music and is easy to usegood goodnice productgentle bassno loud soundproduct quality is decentdont expect heavy music experienceits sometime uncomfortable but its fine i can adjustseriously if you are a bass lover then you can go for itbut its built quality is not good it will damage automatically after monthsit is not suitable for rough usesgot it for less than rs not disappointted at allif you compare it with other brands like boat the sound quality isnt as good as the contemporaries but for the price i paid im not disappointed at allthe bass is solid noise cancellation is average and the earphones are a little low on volume couldve been loudergood value for money product for earphones under very good product as expected

3,the product is very good keya are ergonomic after using it for months the keys are starting to get hard lets see how it performs in the futurefor daily use value for money normal typing is good spacebar key is not properly pressed overall good to buy cheap producti mean it is not a bad keyboard but i can get the same keyboard at local store for cheap price without paying for delivery so please consider this before buyingafter using standard boards like logitech this seems to be with narrow gap between keys i have to adjust myself and careful not pressing two keys but it is smooth and without noise may be useful for beginners very economicalgood keyboard at affordable pricegood product at this budget but not good for gaming very basic keyboardfor typing purposes its waste of money rather go for a mechanical keyboardnice
3,build quality cheap plastic ka h mouse functions smoothly buttonclicks perfect little bit hard should become easier after some timeoverall good value for money compact and easy to use button bit tight to click rest is good no issuesworth to buybudget friendlygoodworking finemonthmouse works well but buttons are pretty hard especially the scroll wheel button is even harder the rear end of the mouse the bulgier side is quite higher hence feels a bit pushy on the palm area of my hand if you have soft hands you better explore other options if it is for rough use then is a good buy
4,sound quality is superb noise cancellation is extremely well but bass quality needs improve mentoverall its great the only thing thats poor is the range its not even half a meter rest is goodgoodits a very good headphone compared to its price previously i had used sony headphones and those were bit expensive but i can surly say that these headphone can give you satisfactory qualitygood battery backuplike the color and bassbuild quality is not good enough the cousin cover get torn with use fit gets loose over battery life is decentlike
3,bluetooth audio sounds really nice decent bass too but fm reception is weak even after plugging in the usb cable antenna the fm reception is not very clear its not able to catch all stations and even when it does catch a station moving the speaker causes problems with the sound clarity i tried a few other similar speakers from other brands and they all have this problem apparently the fm circuit in these soundbar is not goodworth for buying this speaker sound quality is good and loud weightless easy to carry good battery backup its coming for more than hours not tested properly but having good battery backup for sure dont expect bass having little bit but dont expect more im writing this review after days of usageyeseverything finenice and decent product sound is good bluetooth connectivity is good you call microphone is goodcute and nice sound in medium hall
4,it is good for data cablesi liked it basically its good product with good quality but this product is overpriced because same product from different brand are selling at or more less money still i bought this because of the brand namegud quality and packaging but slightly expensive this for my mobile charging cable its useful for not to brake the cable

4,the table is good itself and also good grip on floor one drawback is the edges on board are razor sharp and you might hurt yourself i hurt myself could be the best in price point just smoothing maybe rounding edgesgreat to have for studies and laptop usagefor eating i wouldnt recommendit slides to one side due to weight of laptopoverall it serves its purpose good onedoes the job but not stable in the bed because it has a curve design in four sides if the four sides have a grip to support in surface like floor or bed it would have been a great product also the water bottle space was annoying because my laptop was big and i had less space for the mouseyou have mentioned extra height more than other brands tables which is not its the standard size heightpretty sturdy table very easy to fold good rubber grip which holds the table on the floor firmlywhat is really interesting is that it has a cup holder and a space for keeping tabs or mobile on the desk a very handy featurethe only con of this table is that it wobbles if you keep it on your bed but that is okayoverall a great product worth the money easy to fold and has a good stabilityoverall a good producti ordered this for someone and they received the product on time the product was same as described go for it if youre on a budget
4,the sequential read speeds for a gb video file after reformatting to exfat file system were mbps constant for a gb video filenote the computer being used for testing has a pcie nvme ssd and a fairly modern and powerful cpu but machines with a decent cpu and an average ssd ought to perform simillarly with usb or abovethe writes though were a different story as in the beginning for about gb the speed was mbps but then it dropped to and it started throttling because of excessive heatingdifference between the go and the luxe this is where the ultra dual luxe sines as it doesnt throttle much but the normal go doesthe throttling occurs due to excessive heat generated and because of its plasticky build it is unable to dissapate that heat which can harm the nand flash storage inside it to prevent this it reduces its speed and transfers in chunks of about mb before pausing briefly it is a good thing as it prevents damage to the storage component hence increasing lifespan but at the cost of speeds but after mpbs it further drops down to then and becomes stable there here its just too slow for heavy everyday use like transferring videos for editing room temp c your milage may vary with different types of files computers and portsbut for the vast majority of users who just use it as a backup or for once in a while storage or for regularly working with small files like pots and photos its perfectly fine its fast makes it convenient to transfer files between phones and laptops and desktops because of its versatile setup of a changeable usb c and a setup it feels strong and durable even through its made if plasticfor the price of rs for the gb variant it is not very affordable a regular usb a penflash drive and a type a to c adapter combination as illustrated above available for about rs as of writing this review and a gb flash drive costing anywhere between and rs as of writing this review will cost less but a regular usb drive and the combo will not be as convenient and fast but again its not required for most people not to mention that the adapter is quite useful elsewhere as well but for the small niche of users who want speed and have small files below gb at a time to work with its recommendotherwise going with the luxe for performance or the adapter setup better value for money as mentioned above will be a better decisionhope you find this effort helpfulit would be better if the holder of pendrive is strong enoughand its very hard to insert into my type c mobile lggxi got bit scared thinking of it will get brokenbetter to buy this in offer the price gets less than i bought i got it for prosreceived product on time with good packagenice design portable and easy to useoptimum data transfer speed and reasonable priceconsbuilt quality could have been bettertype c is not as easy to plug and unplugits look good with nice finish it is very convenient to use one drawback is plastic is soft it seems fragile compare to metal pendriveplastic material is thin and light weightstorage mentioned but it has only gbvalue for moneygood product but not so sturdygoodvery good product

3,comfortable keys and smooth typinggoodaverageoknothing to saygoodso the space bar was just horrible zero response from both side of the key and had to press hard in the center part as well and the minus key on the numpad was not working at all you just cant use a keyboard with a space bar like this
4,for it might be too small also its wobbly was good enough for not making me return itif you own gaming laptop and want some elevation for those fans its not a bad purchase but the temperature is not much but good for eye levelas it has simple design it may not block air flow but it will not comfortable if you use laptops keyboard as it will start shaking as it doesnt provide such stability and so it is nor usable for typing purpose you must have to use external keyboard and mouse as expected small form factorunder slightly rough usage bottom pads came off but still works as expectedquality productbest to buygood
4,i am using it from month it works decentsize is bit small so it does not provide a good ergonomicas they say clicks are noiseless that is not true button press sound is thereoverall its considerable and worth buying itlikelight weight and work wellgoodhands down logitech is the best in mouses but i am finding an issue with the scroller on some days all of a sudden the scroller isnt smooth i have no clue why i am not able to scroll smoothly with itgood battery life no noise good for normal routine usagem is a very good product from logitech this is nd wireless mouse i bought from them i bought this product on st july and im writing this review as my left click is going kaput everything is good about this mouse except the battery part i use this mouse hrs a day and i had to change its battery every nd month so those who are buying this product should also buy a rechargeable battery and charger this mouse is only meant for general work and a bit of casual gaming small games if you try to play those triple aaa games you will feel the laggood
4,first of all the item looks good attractive the front and back side covers are good feels smooth and premium i give it a star considering the below pointsalso thanks to amazon for superfast delivery paper quality nice i used ball pens sketch pens and also inkpens all cases no soaking of ink binding spiral binding and qality is good and attractive sturdiness here it could have been a little better considering the price tag light weight binding and paper quality is nice still lite weght thats a plus writing experience better than average available notbooks in similar pricetagfirst off the notebook design is great pages are nice and smooth but a bit on the thinner side the subject dividers are thicker than other pagesthe qc has some issues as of the one unit i ordered for testing this product rs some pages were folded up from the corners and become larger when unfolded as depicted in the picture above many pages were glued onto each other hence tearing some part when flipping them again illustrated in the picture added aboveits an absolute steal deal for rs per piece as no other notebook competes in the spiral bind page market and notebooks of about pages non spiral bound of a simillar size are sold for rs as of writing this reviewthe only downside i found besides the qc is that it doesnt include an index page otherwise it has some games riddles and a notes pages like other notebooks and the first page is dedicated to the owners details and contact no great to see it presentoverall i recommend this product because of the value for money and the quality i understand my unit was a one off as other reviews dont seem to mention this will update after using this for a few more weeksthe product is worth the money the paper quality was good and it has six separations for six different subjectsvalu for moneypremium qualityi ordered only one copy was a bit damaged from the bindingi got all the same design notebook which is little disappointing me except that everything is finegood product
4,packing was not good over all good productscroll wheel is very small otherwise the product seems good at least at the first use bit disappointed with onoff switch its too tiny otherwise product is nice gave star for the flimsy top cover and onoff button rest all is good easy to navigate on off button at the bottom could have been better not the regular type of putting the battery at the bottom part pull the top cover and place the battery the slot is given for the wireless adapter adjacent to the battery compartment easy to use simple plugandplay for better results switch off the mouse only during weekends draining of battery power to some extent is fine when compared to the clumsiness of the small onoff buttongood to use

audio monoclick on bluetooth audio renderer stereo wait a few seconds for it to complynow your headset should be connectedin watching youtube i do get some lag but with different headsets the lag increases or decreasesthe same with me using vlc or windows media player sometimes if i stop the video app and restart then it will be no lagi dont use zoomteamsskype so i cannot test how the mic setup would functionany one that has any input for this please use any or all of my post and add to it this would be helpful to alot of peoplefirst post so for a few months i was using it strictly thru win utilizing win drivers and bluetooth connection page thru settingssystem but a few times i tried to use with music streaming to sony xb or oneplus buds wireless bass edition and there would be intermittant drops also when it came to pairing and connecting it would consistanly slow down my hp amd a chipset laptop also anytime i took the dongle out it would also affect disconnect my thumbdrive so i assumed it was a throttling going on with my usb ports i have sandisk dual drive wd passport dvi to hdmi and logitech dongle so one by one i disconnected everything and left the bt dongle and it was a little betterso i checked the tp link india site for any faq related when i searched in the downloadsdrivers section there was software driver present so i downloaded installed it and win taskbar shows bt icon to use thebt dongle the driver software is by csr harmony wireless software stack version once installed there are more options that can be accessed thru the bt icon in taskbar the bt icon sits in the system tray as before audio transmission can be switched between stereo and mono also if your playing a video or audio file and you start the pairing process once connected there will be slight pause then it connects to the output in stereo it works really well i purchased a long usb male to female cable and now i have a little bit more increase in connection distance i have not tried this for transfer of files if and when i find a need to do so i will updatefor now at this price point it gives me freedom to connect my bt audio gear instead of purchasing a more expensive unit to give my laptop bt capabilites and this is as small if not smaller than some thumbdrives oh and i also purchased a seperate qz powered usb hub for my drives so the only usb devices connected are the dongle and the hub now when i disconnect the bt dongle my drives stay connectedi hope this information is helpful i tried not to make it too long but it happened if any questions arise please drop me a line and i will respond with whatever help i can givetp link products usually work wellwhile longevity with continuous use may vary but these devices are not intended for prolonged or continuous usei have had multiple to link devices ranging from wifi adapters routers range extenders etcnow i have tried this bluetooth adapterprosminuscule size you can keep attached to the device not noticeablebut not recommended to do soas its usually set to discoverable during setup and it has decent rangeso if one is too skeptical might lead to security issues although the hacker will have to be in the same house probablyrange is decentworks good in the same roomthis kind of device is usually meant for local connectivity usually without barriersi use it to connect headphones to the pc and it works nicely for thati earlier had a bluetooth adapter from enter and that worked well too except for the range and bandwidth required nowadays has increasedso some choppy audio did occur with todays high quality audios and that got managed with this bluetooth adapternice clean audiolastly it works nicely with linuxi use debian based ubuntuand its almost plug and playi did have blueman bluetooth manager installed from the previous adapter i had and when i plugged it ini didnt have to do anything elseso unlike what the site says about only windows it definitely works with linuxi cant say if the version ub will work thoughwhile installing the driver in windows i noticed it was installing csr stackand csr original chip there are many fake ones is known to work with linuxso maybe thats why it worked wellcoming to windows i have wini had bluesoleil preinstalled and it worked with itdidnt have to install any driver separatelybut there is a driver available in their site for xpin win and above its supposed to be plug and playso no issues therenow the consa bit high price than rest of the companies probably can improve on thati bought it for audio quality is good but somehow compared to my enter bluetooth stackthe audio was a bit mutedhad to increase the volume higher to reach the same level of loudnessbut even then i feel a slight reduction in the dynamic range of the audio no idea if thats a software or hardware issueencodingdecoding issueits not very noticeable specially of someone doesnt have anything to compare withlastly the windows driver is mbgranted it has both and versionsbut each one is almost mbthats way to big for a driver of these devicesneither bluesoleilblueman cross mbso i dont know what is being packaged in those driversalso somehow the driver didnt have a clean install in my system something to do with incorrect loading of c libraryit didnt matter as i already had another driver installedoverall a nifty little devicei have no need for bluetooth as i dont have any device that requires iti just needed a adapter to solve the bandwidth problemand that purpose is nicely served and that it works both in win and linux is very helpfuldoes the job well few conshence one star lessusing it for weeks just plug it install drivers and you are good to go seem less connection with ps controller latency is very low around ms so basically connection is even faster than wired connection ms but when i simultaneously connect airpods gen the sound output was very weak it was muffled but it serves my main purpose with ps controller apparently it seems like its the most relevant bluetooth adapter out there good connectivity and all sort of stuffs like that generally comes in a bt adapters id say the only con is the installation part it took a while figure out which was their website and drivers of ub aside from this everything is fabulousvery easy to install connectivity is also good but sometimes while using bluetooth earphones sound cracks also bluetooth sharing is quite slow thats allotherwise th product is very good easy to install i mean just plug in connectivity is on all point but time i feel fumble issues sound quality is all depends on your wireless speakerif you are tight budget its okay then otherwise if can spend extra go for bt version much better in both range and connectivitylike

4,its a china product to be clear look and feel is good base of the device is little wider so if you have pin socket points consecutively then ysing the next socket could be difficultthe wifi signal strength is good as extender but it reduces internet speed for example my internet speed is mbps which i get if directly connected to my primary router network but if connected through extender it downgrades to mbps overall okay to use i would have been happy to see a made in india device as the price is also not very low but unfortunately india is not manufacturing any it seems band is an ancient technologythis device will supply only ghzthat means ghz will not be available in your room where you choose to use thisit was difficult to use and install at first after that its been working perfectly with great signal strengthit is a good product valued for money but i think it should be sometimes give low speedi wish i could have ordered dual band but so far its giving satisfactory serviceworking fineproduct is ok but its only for ghz mistakenly got it

4,when i purchased this watch i thought it couple be used to send sms make calls access notifications without being connected to the phone i knew that third party notifications required the phone to be connected to the internet but i thought the watch could place calls and send texts even if the phone is switched off the product i ordered can only make calls when disconnected from the phone features such as sms surprising since this is an lte version and notifications this includes watch apps such as outlook that require internet are only synced with the watch on e it is connected to the phone via bluetoothi did not check other features as the main reason i ordered this watch was accessibility to notifications without phonei have been using this since june it looks good on the wristand has all useful features like callingreading and replying whatsapp messagesthe battery is too low though i keep it switched off at nightie never used it to track sleep yet have to charge every couple of days plus it gets charged slowall features of the watch is good but battery backup is very poor after full charge it runs hours but after average uses it will run hours onlyits amazing with the lte function now i dont lug my phone to the gym but the battery life sucks and have to charge twice specially when i use lte also it heats for some reason and needs to cool down once in a while that time the watch automatically goes into hibernation and starts after some timepositives areaccuracysleep trackingo monitorremote lte connectionwears amazing on the wristgreat screennegativebattery lifeusing it for month fits well have wireless charger you can also charge it from your phone if your phone supports wireless charging one thing which is common to most smart watches is when youre traveling in bus or car in a bumby road it will assume you are jogging and congratulate you for completing daily tasks charging is too slow which is to be expectedunless you have a samsung flagship phone you wont be able to see camera app on the watch and youll have to get third party applications and theyre just horribleproduct is goodpros health accuracy is high ui is good design and build quality is also goodcon app is not that good and facing connectivity issuesgood
3,honest review i got these buds in and i only buy earbuds because of the music movies seriesmusic experience tbh i like to hear balanced music like crystal clear sound with a balanced bass but yeah if you are bass lover then just think again before buying itbattery hypersync bluetooth i checked the box and there its written bluetooth but its range is low and thats not up to my expectations but it will work for me so yeah if you are just buying it for bluetooth just think againinstacharge it actually works very wellbuds in ear design is good and they fits perfectly also you can do workout exercise running etc but if your own ears are somewhat different like so big then its your problem although it comes with different buds sizes so u can try thembuds are really so light so yeah i personally like themcalling experience voicevideo call these buds dont come with anc mode so please dont buy them just for ancand incall range is too low which i really dont expected but it will work for methe sound quality is good no doubt but on a personal note such buds dont suit my ear others who used it liked it thoughvery bad quality of product stop working after monthsplease dont waste your money on this earbudgood sound good bassall features is nicegood in room or silent placesome background noise come in open area like road during travelbut this prob in all companieslike at this price but noise cancellation is not so goodgood product for this amount rarely facing issue while redmi for my listing music and it has great qualitythe sound quality is very clear and the range is very good but the bass is not that great
4,i used these for my wireless mouse which is a razer deathadder v one of these would last exactly from a week to two was weird because i used the mouse same way with each but some of the batteries would die out quicker than expected should be fine if youre using it something less taxing like a wireless mousegoodfor wall clocks sctv remotesthe batteries delivered in ok condition but cant make out the life or actual price as covered by an external sticker on top of itnicebattery life is excellent as compare to other brandsnicegood
4,i was using jbl c si and this time bought jbl csi and honestly i couldnt feel much difference between this one common thing about these are the cheap wire quality jbl could have address thisi have used it for listening songs and i can say it is good earphones for that priceaverage expected too much but sound quality is good but bass is not that great overall good productearphone has good sound qualityavaragenice headphone sound quality only issue is the paint coating started pealing off from the head piece and the wire at the connector end chipped off gradually
4,good product i am giving this review after months of use and i have ha good experience with this monitorthe only problem you may face is the control panel is not userfriendly it is different to operate itgood pics and good gaming all are top in this price range va panel is goodits alright as long as you are not expecting musch from itworth for money and best for home use screen size also good and eye protection is bestquality vis this product is good but after i deal for another order suddenlty price become high why in just day answer me is it jockworth monitor this pricemonitor is good if youre not doing heavy graphic design activity coz display become bit pixallated in dark i checked this is not issue of my display driver or hdmi out but image is crisp and good refresh rate for office applications good buy at this price but if you can afford costlier monitor then look for someone having hight adjustment options this one not having any
3,goodproduct is as described good we can use itgood for the pricethese are not super bright but i like them since small in size and can be foldedeasy to carry when travel and can be used with poerbanki use it sometimes as night light on my charger facing to ceiling or at wallloved itnice oneworthy product at this lowest pricegood lighting and good quality

3,bahut hi achha product hai badhiya saund and bluetooth connectivitybuild material is plastic body however sound was goodnicesound quality is goodbattery performance goodit is a satisfactory bluetooth speaker and is perfect choice for those who are looking for a budget wireless speaker for their laptop or mobile phone with low volume issues or for those who need some portable music device and who dont want to shell out lot of money it serves these purpose very well and is not pricey why i am saying all thisfirst things first i got this at the black one only as rest of the colors were way too pricey and choice of colors can be sacrificed in such a case my laptop and phone volume is too low and watching a video or listening to music on these devices is not a good experience so here too this speaker served the purpose as connectivity is excellent size of speaker is conveniently small lightweight and battery backup is damm awesome after a complete charge i used this speaker for continuously for about hours at about volume and still the speaker is left with charge i cannot comment right now for the charging time as it arrived with more than charge and i just topped it to full bluetooth connectivity is exceptionally good upto mtrs fm reception is average without connecting the datacharging cable but it is awesome if the cable is connected it has only four buttons and all the functions are controlled by these buttons only first button m is mode which when pressed switches from bluetooth to fm to aux to usbmemory card transition of switching is flawless volume updown keys are used to change volume and switch the channels long press changes the volume and short pressclick changes the channels in fm or changes the track via aux most usefull feature of this speaker is its mic yes you can actually use this speaker when connected to phone to talk with someone and that too with no connectivity issues voice clarity is very good for the calls made music clarity is not very good read cons for this quality of the plastics used seems good and feels durablecons sound quality is just average voice call clarity is very good where music is not dominant but when it comes to music this speaker struggles to deliver quality people are complaining in reviews that it doesnot produce any bass but actually its is the bass produced by the speaker which deteriorates the quality this is understandable for this product as it just has one tiny speaker inside and if manufacturer makes it to produce some bass will definitely deteriorate the music quality but this is manageable and you can adjust the music equalizers in your laptop or phone to get pretty decent music quality this is the reason i dont consider its music quality a con for the product theres one limitation about charging connector to it comes with a charging port compatible to ab type connector so if you have a charger with data cable supporting c type connectors you are bound to use the charging cable supplied with speaker only so you cannot keep just one common cable with you to charge both your phone and speaker instead you will have to carry two different cables this speaker does not come with a charger so you will have to use your mobiles charger v a for the purpose but for the price rage this seems reasonableuseful tip for buyers most of the smart phones will display battery percentage left in the speaker but you can install any of these two apps bluebatt or bluetooth check ringtone and show battery level from the playstore if in case your phone is unable to fetch battery data from speakerwhat you get in complete package unit of bluetooth speaker cable which has aux connector usb connector and ab type micro usb connector tiny user manualquality of packaging excellent sturdy packaging used by cloudtail to secure the companys product packaging manufacturing date was of mayi like itportability and bluetooth connection is goodawesome
3,design of the keyboard and mouse lenght of the wire is shortvalue for money worth it goodnice productgood for lightweight use ocassional gaming can be done uplifted keys keep your hands soft while typingalthough it is quite cheap and works nicely for me i think this is not for those who look for soft touch keyboard keys feel lose and needed to be hit a little harder also the enter key is upside down compared to most keyboards around as a result the key is in the second row instead of the first could be irritating for those fast typing guysgo for itvalue for money
3,the headband is really thin therefore it starts to hurt after mins of use i have wrapped a napkin around it for extra cushion but that doesnt look good if using outside i wish the comfort level was betterexpected a better product from jbl the bass is quite low and has some disturbance alsobest entry level nc headset with better sound quality nc is not that good but cancels subtle noises and turn down down other noises people talking are not canceled only muted down sound is good for the price range if you are looking for superior nc try to buy sony xms wheb there is an offer which is my next headset to buy the cushions are far too small to fully cover ear they kinda rests on ur ear edges which is kinda painful over long usage there was no sweating issue since the headphone has air holes and provide air circulation to ears charging time was around hour battery life is so perfect like u can charge this full and use it for a while week without nc with around to hrs of daily usage so final verdict is bang for the bucks if u r into nc just go buy xms good quality productvery good for phone callsthe microphone is excellent much better than most bluetooth earphonesthe audio is clear but the shape of the earbuds fails to direct the audio reliably across different types of ear sizesjbl tried replicating the apple earbud shape does not fit the ear snuglyfalls off oftenits a good quality product but battery drains very fastanc is just a gimmick on this one bass is poor dont buy if you need bass quality is good looks nice comfort wise the clamping force is a bit tight if you like the cozy feel good for gym or running sound isolation is good earcups are slightly small for over ear would keep touching the edges of your ears you may get used to it or not besides bass the sound is good battery life and connectivity is good too boat has better base and more comfort but they also fit loose these fit tighteroverall good product but after month bluetooth not working
4,usable for cleaning tech kitsgood product at this pricethe microfiber cloths were perfect objects to clean my laptop screen the brush was a bit rough and the bristles kind of fans out while cleaning and you need to use your fingers to put it back to your original shape every now and then which is not hygienic havent used the cleaning solution so cannot comment on thatwell packaged and the product works greateverything is nice but brush is not value for moneyeasy to clean laptop and even phone travelfriendly productsproduct is good however cloth quality could have better at this price it is bit costlyworthable
4,updatei returned the drive with money reverted backseller was cooperative reverted without hassle or communicationabout the brand sandisk xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxsandisk is an israeliamerican manufacturer of flash memory products including memory cards and readers usb flash drives and solid state drives as of february it is the thirdlargest manufacturer of flash memorysandisk was founded in by eli harari sanjay mehrotra and jack yuan with sanjay mehrotra being the president the ceoon may sandisk was acquired by hard drive manufacturer western digital in a us billion dealwhy a dual drive why gb why sandiskxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxbefore we proceed with the musclemerits or the key features of the device lets have a quick look upon my personal selection processdual drive apart from my need for a basic pen drive with sufficient storage i chose to go with a dual drive that could work with my mobile devices to offload it of the memory burdens and play some stored media at instant whenever a desire crosses over i could have gone with a basic pendrive with a usb to otg adaptor cable but then i realized in todays comfortseeking world whos will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it then fit it in event of a sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement gb this capacity seemed to offer a decent compromise between storage price future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size gb ensures that you wont have to empty it out any sooner or on a regular basissandisk in the recent few years sandisk after becoming a western digital brand has witnessed a tremendous growth in market capitalization quality and brand image offers the best value for money deals for an average usagemoreover could not find much reputed brands in the storage with otg featurea note speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend samsungabout our productxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx the device comes with the title sandisk ultra dual drive m and is the newer version of its previous iteration here i need to quote that the term ultra came quite as a surprise to me as i found nothing in lines with a common understanding of ultra we will discuss it in detail in upcoming columns of speed with a microusb connector on one end and a usb connector on the other the drive lets you move content easily between your android phones tablets with micro usb ports only or laptopsboth the connectors are carved out of metal the usb connector is backwardcompatible with usb ports size the size of the usb is quite small which can be good for easy storage in your pockets but might be tedious to find if misplacedthe usb fares around an inch in perfect closed condition and inches when expanded at usb end construction the device has a plastic body the overall construction of the drive is just average the retractable plastic column seems to the weakest link of all and would surely break if you accidentally step over it however the actual drive storage portion is built of a rigid plastic and wont give up so easily both the usb ports are built of metal which again is quite a relief fit finish being equipped with a retractable mechanism being too small the drive is not so smooth to use slidein or out in a single shot and needs some getting used to but then most of the otg drives are designed small and hence have some or the other odd way of conserving sizethe usb ports fit comfortably in devices and pulling it out too is fairly easy storage format since the previous fat version had a limitation of file transfer size of a maximum of gb for a single file ntfs was not compatible with mac os so with increasing file sizes ex fat format was devised which doesnt have a size limitation like fat yet is compatible with mac as well so our drive has only ex fat ntfs formats to choose comes in ex fat by default with kb file allocation size increasing the file allocation size may increase the transfer speeds a little but will affect the storage capacity little too changing it from to kb increased my write speeds from mbs to mbs if thats a relief to anyonethe format would surely work well with most of the tvs tablets and mobiles though check it with the car audio head unit and try to change to ntfs if it doesnt work speed the demerit detail i have been a flagship gadgets freak all my life preliminary to my purchase i had doubts regarding its speed as quoted by fellow buyers but then i did not have speed in my mind as a primary motive for this there were not many options for dual otg device so i took a leap of faith and went ahead with purchasemy basic intent was to load bulk movies from my laptop into it and watch it over my tv or mobile however when i was transferring movies of a total size gb it started showing minutes which kept on getting higher it felt like waiting forever for it to happeneven for a single movie of gb it took minutes sec by stopwatch to transfer the write speeds started with mbsec and went down down to mbsec even with my older kingston dt elite gbthe write speeds were in excess of mbseci admit i have a usb port at my laptop yet i was never used to such low speeds ever the tagline ultra and mentioned speeds of mbsec which i suppose is the rated max speeds at usb ports felt like a dream and beyond exaggerationfinally with every passing minute it became all the more unbearable and annoying even in ntfs format speeds were the samei had never expected it to be this slow in this modern era of thus finally i decided to return it but i suppose i will only get a replacement not reversali know that readwrite speeds depend upon a lot of factors including transferred file type format configuration of drive configuration of host destination device etcbenchmark crystal disk mark scores for a file transfer of mb size were mbs read mbs write which looked like a mere consolation transfer between my samsung s mobile s tablet too was not fastverdict yes my friends all other reviews about this being slow to the point of being unbearable are absolutely right and maybe san disk should retag it as ultraslow storage out of the total name plate rating of gb the actual allocated space for usage is around gb which is ok enough warranty the product comes with a year limited warranty which is one of the segment best offers price i bought the device for bucks which was reasonable to me given the storage size dual drive brand image mrp over the pack was printed bucks it was tagged made in malaysia only if it was a bit fasterfinal verdictxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxall in all in my personal opinion given the brand image ultratagline modern day technology advancements even if you try to be too generous or lenient upon the transfer speeds yet its hard to spare such a low read write rateseven for routine tasks it will keep on reminding you of the compromise you made for a full price it could have been a great allrounder device coupled with the good brand reputation of sandisk years of warranty had its speed been any bettercovered here actual storage space heating mobile phones tight fitting on mobile phones speed formatting file system value for money free app company brand sellerabout company product seller sandisk ultra is a brand of western digital which is the same company that sells external harddisk storage devices under the brand wd elements and wd portable about to years ago wd elements portable drives of tb and tb were priced rs less than current day prices they were sold by cloudtail seller on amazon now sandisk and wd drives are sold by appario retail seller on amazon for best prices on sandisk and wd products in india the current seller has the lowest prices for authentic brand new products reason for higher prices for same brands same capacity storage devices may be various such as import duties taxes manufacturing costs higher demand for the brand etcreview sandisk ultra dual gb usb otg pen drive gold storage space just as in external harddisk drives the actual usable storage space will be less than what is mentioned on the product same as others for the gb pen drive actual storage space available is gb this is normal and not some fraud or fake advertisement this is because it has fat file system also the device uses some space for its functionality and use in linux os laptop the available storage space on this fat pen drive is shown to be gb so thats gb more than what windows os calculates using their ntfs file system heating even with just minutes of use you can touch and feel that the metal part of the pen drive is getting heated but the performance of the drive has not got affected by the heat this heating does not happen in wd external harddisks and seems to be unique to small pen drives of various brands mobile phones the pen drive works with android os of mi phones such as redmi note running android including old android version as well too tight for phones the pen drive is a tight fit on mobile phones tablets so be careful when pulling it out so as to not damage your phone because this is also the charging point for your phone if you feel that your phone is too tight for this pen drive then it is best not to use it for phone data storage management value for money even if you dont use this pen drive for mobile phone it is still the best price for a gb pen drive with a usb backward compatible with older usb ports on older laptops and computers speed the speed is extremely good for windows os laptop linux os laptop and android mobile phones file system formatting the pen drive unless you are sure you wont use your pen drive on a particular device dont format the pen drive to change its fat file systembut for example if you have decided that you wont use it on mobile phones or tablets because the fitting is too tight and you dont want to risk damage to this point which is primarily used for charging then go ahead and format the pen drive for your laptop with ntfs formatting you will see an increase in available storage space in your pen drive with your linux systems file format you will have better storage space than any windows file system beware that if the pen drive has ntfs file system then it wont work with mobile phones tablets laptops which dont have windows operating system same way if you format the pen drive for linux os file system it wont be recognised on windows laptops android phones tablets etc if like most people you will be using this pen drive on laptops or other devices of friends or coworkers then leave the existing fat file system as it is free app memory zone app for android is bundled free in this pen drive it is easy to install and doesnt take any phone permissions other than storage access it is very useful app with easy userinterface app takes mb storage space on android phones features include cleaning junk files that you may not otherwise know

4,vfm indoor use living roombedrrom use and clear view upto sqft roomsconfiguration is pretty easy for any novice night mode is good as wellonly flaw i feel is that the head portion is bulky while its resting stand is not heavy leading to the camera movements if not screwd downbest camera impressed me video quality is osome but the app lagsi like itit is a very compact product that can fit almost anywhere the only drawback is that most of the features that it offers are cloud based and requires you to pay to avail themfeatures like rich notification where the phone notifications also contain a screenshot when the motion is detected should have been included as part of free service at least when connected to the same wifi as of now the only free notification that you get is an alert with the date and time the motion was detected and you need to open the app and wait for it to load up before knowing what motion had occuredai motion detection also should have been a locally available free feature instead of relying on cloud the normal motion detection is not very perfect and has few false positivesalso a web ui would have been nice to have instead of relying only on the tapo app to view and configure the settingsoverall as a normal ip camera with recording this is great but most features that it provides requires paid cloud connectivity which was disappointing and it lacks a web ui hencei would recommend that you check other brands before deciding to buy thisvery good for small shops or indoor for house careit was definitely not a new sealed product it looked like a returned product resold to meit was dusty inside original stickering worn out etc but the product works n i am ok with ittapo cam is very good and working as expected and gb sd card can record upto days and continue in loop mode we can see person and motion detection events

4,the other reviews say that the volume is too low but it is not at all like that it is pretty good for such a small speaker the quality and the volume is very good it is very easy to carry around the people who bought jbl go this is an hands down upgradetion would highly recommend the price is too high but i got it in an offer that is the only point the bluetooth connectivity is fast and very reliable and is completely water proof comming to the end it is pretty much a good speaker but for people with a budget pls try other brandsi love jbl audio products and used many like earphone and headphones but that all products were brought from official website but this time i tried amazon and it still worth and geniune seller and thanks for him and awesome sound more than expected and clarity and bass andvoice is very punch and not disturb your hear but i noticed that it have very very lite humms wen it turns on the speaker without pairing but not noticablebass is portable also connectivity is fastcharged is latejbl go is actually good but sound quality is not much better according to priceover all good delivery aur packaging bhi bhot acha haibattery level indicator not availablegood audio but the mic feature is not that goodgood bluetooth speakers by themselves but bit overpriced theyre not a significant upgrade from the original jbl go i have both of them and the sound quality is fairly similar rather the older speakers sometimes sound better
4,the edges may start gapping out but overall quality including touch sensitivity is good as for the price tagthe packaging was very nice there was a microfibre cloth in the box though it was basic i liked it now the main product it was just perfect in size installation process was quite simple but tempered glass is very fingerprint catchy in harsh lighting the fingerprints could be noticed easilyproduct is otherwise good but attracts too much visible finger impressions during routine use with a clean handquite easy to installvery easy even for beginnersinstallation was smooth after installing it screen is responsive n does what it is for
4,good gamepad couldve been better in ergonomics cos after a while the grip starts aching also comes with haptic vibration feedback which is great for the pricegamepad is very good and its working also good worth to buyin terms of bulid quality its plastic and you know it beforehand theres a silicon grip patch which is nice but the gripfeel will be worn off after use and youll be left with a shiny and slippery patchfeels sturdy inhand but personally i used it to play many games mostly fifa and the keys stopped working after certain time due to the silicon layer under keyseven though i wasnt using it aggressively then too it didnt last monthsi was hoping for better performance but sadly that wasnt the case the joystick gear itself was precise but r l triggers was not working as they should be after months even after many failed attempts to calibratethis gamepad is working good with pc tv and mobiles too if you have an otg one of the best and affordable gamepad go for itliked itposting review after more than hrs usedfirst of all i buy this gamepad to check experience it is amazing vibrations lights are good build quality is awesome its better than i expect we can adjust vibration intensity depending on games best for racing and sport kind games but honestly if you are more into fps or shooting kind of games our keyboard and mouse are best to feel in gamethe reason i used wired is it comes with very good length and that is enough to enjoy the game that why i dint waste extra money for just remove wirenice consolegood product
4,its little small for big hands but best available in the marketgood product but too smaller than the regular onehello everyonei bought this mouse in april so after months of use im writing this reviewbattery the most important one it came with a single aasized battery clock battery that worked from st april th december which is more than months even though my usage was heavy hours average per day in a corporate job day of hourslook amazing with beautiful curves though battery closing pane could have been betterusb transmitter its normal and can be carried inside the battery cavityswitch onoff switch is not handy you need a long nail to switch it onoff but is strong enough to resist a hard stroke when you force it to off with your nailless fingersprecision and laser precision is just what most mouses have which is accurate and the laser is invisible no annoying light in the bottombuttons buttons produce a slight noise on click and after a long usage the left button is shaking slightlyoverall ratings the main reason for you to buy this its battery efficiency it will cost you only inr for monthsits very small and it trouble for my hand which is considerably smaller than other people it do fit nicely in year old nephew but now mine but no complains works great from far distance so its good there its should be sold for only its slighly over pricednice mouseeasy to holdworking very smooth and fast response time is very goodgood durable productits a great mouse under this price for normal office use it would have been much better if it had silent clicksworking well so far
4,the router wont turn on requested for replacementupdate the replacement router is working fine judging by the condition of the boxes i probably had received a refurbished item the first time aroundgood product for home useafter months it is working nice and finegood very compactthis router is super easy to install and you can hang it on the wall as well it comes with years of warranty and the size of the router is very small and despite of that it gives good signal to the adjacent roomgo for it it is good productworking good
4,the keyboard and mouse are good for typing and normal use cannot comment about battery life since ive used it only for a month sometimes mouse did not respond when laptop got hot while gaming hence not using the set for gamingproduct is very good but i have issues with the packingthe outer plastic bag was fine but the amazon packing boxbrown was brokenthe product box and the product was fine mouse battery lid is little bit loose otherwise goodproduct is good i have got defective product first and i have option for replacement and the same day my product was replaced overall the product is smooth and easy to useno caps lock light button it must be there for entering passwordsall good except tiny dongle which we loose many timesthe keyboard is really good the travel is incredible especially when youre coming from an ultrabook keyboardpackaging no cover nothing just the box which was literally torn with visible brown cardboard insides yikesgood
4,price is high is given in curved shape bench unable to stand sturdy it is falling be careful while using laptopvalue for moneyeasy folding convenient to user working place is little bit congested and the stability is horrible though user friendly like this productit is good but please sell spare parts also like stand lock and all the thingsi like it
4,very goodnice product and handy for travel purposes and use at officenicegood calculator but i think price is high as compared to marketwriting review after one month usage very good quality and worth the money no issue till date go for itit is working finei like it
3,if you are using a seperate mouse go without cup holder itll give you some space otherwise its fine for even inch laptop its strong and sturdy but it should be to not everything is perfect the sturdiness the color the finishing the height the weight the only con is that it can be a little shaky if you use it on the bedthe table is lightweight and less durable but it serves its purposeits a good product for its price dont expect too muchproduct is good but price rs is little more higher than over all quality of product and also there is no logo of amezon basicsits goodi think the mobiletablet holder is uselessmaterial is of good quality and product is worth for money it would be nice to have a lock mechanism so that stands doesnt tend to close once placed in surfaces like bedthe table is very strong will not break easilybut its legs are not stable at all if you keep laptop on it and is not supported then the whole table will fall sideways it happened twice to me
4,using it to connect my type c plantronic headphones to dell laptop and its working finewe like this product it is just amazingsupport good charging speednicesmall yet very good accessory for the car it is very small in size and becomes a part of the car interiorthere is no lag in supplying the power and gives an ease to connect phone with usb c type on a usb a portif you are looking for a good converter then this is itannoying advertisement of asking you to give star rating is in the packaging box of this productit is very helpful in charging phones in old cars i am using an old car and it only has usb b ports and i am using it for some power banks alsoi had an unused cable c to lightning port but was not being used i ordered this product and it turn out to be miracle for me now i can use my unused cable with this product good product
4,i use it for writing messages or drawing the only con is it reflects light and brightness is less so nothing is visible when lights are out but its very smooth and easy to use i like it the price its great a erase and different ink poor functions would have completed the packageit might be the result of adding additional materials for durability or longetivity who knows but the penstrokes youll see be a little leaky and thickerdisadvantagebuild quality is very poor light weight plastic finishingif children handles the product more carefullybrightness very poorskin or finger touch also writing the lcdadvantageprice is valuablelock button is useful oneyou can always trust amazon basics got it yesterday and the quality and feel is gooduseful one for kindergarten students
3,quality of the material is not that good if it falls then it will break in parts easily but overall it is easy to use and speed of the ports is fastmanufacturing quality is quite poor even a small movement can cause the second device to get unplugged from the usb port which is not at all strongits cheap on multiple levels first ad foremost money wise and then most importantly quality wise used it for weeks and the casing came off and i cant seem to click it back into place it worksfor the time being so im just waiting for it to die now but for rupees what else can we expectbuilt in quality is not so good its very sensitiveit is not tiny but small enough not to clutter my desk cord length of about to ft is nice usb ports work well the only negative point that is glaring is the poor finish however for the price a good buy was damaged seems to be a some one has used and returned this item
3,dissapointed in the microphonedont buy for calling purpose voice not delivered properly to hearing other side you should by best earphone in local marketive been looking for a good pair of earphones with type c as my phone now comes without a mm jack sadly pixel aunfortunately indian markets doesnt have much of budget usb c earphones as its extremely limited in availability so my search gotten narrowed down to this onepros works okayish for the price sound quality average call quality fairly good i didnt had much complaints from the other side during phone calls tested when riding bike also there were some wind noises reportedly but still does the job buttons works well havent noticed any niggles thus farcons definitely not recommended for audiophiles as theres no distinction between highs mids and lows sound quality gets muffled if volume raised above bass is not that good its there you can feel it but its not adequate and gets muddles out if the volume raised pls make use of your eq app poweramp equaliser app in my case to tweak up the settings to get noticed on its bass very mediocre performance of mids and highs too gets slightly better if tweaked with an eq app causes pain in ears if used continuoslyif you are looking out for a decent budget usb c earphones mainly for calling then go with this one works well for the voice callsits goodmic is not properi think this is the best c type headphone for this price segment sound quality bass meterial quality all are little above average so for rs blue we can definitely buy without second thoughtworked well for first two months now only one side is workingi bought it to use with my samsung s plus which does not have any headphone jack the bluetooth earphones work but when im in bed on my side they have accidental touch with the pillow or somewhere so i bought these usbc wired headphones they work with my tab which is good news but the audio quality is average it sounds tinny just like a rs headphones maybe that is to be expected because these earphones are cheap so i ended up not using them very often
4,i have been using this mouse for like months and this is the best mouse under the mouse has the basic gaming stuff like extra buttons dpi settings but the main thing is the software like you can customize so much on this mouse the rgb is fully customizable you can set many macros you can revamp the keys and also change the dpi values these features usually come in expensive gamming mouses but this is very good for this cheapthe design is also very good and one thing you should note before buying is that this mouse is big like it is big as my hand so if you got small hands you should think twice but it doesnt affect that much i got the hang of it in like a weekit doesnt come with any warranty so thats a con but a part of it everything is so goodreally would recommendthis mouse is very good for gaming the high dpi sensor on this mouse is very good their is no drifting the rgb is very goodi have used this mouse for about months and its still intact no problem with scroll wheel or side buttonthe software provided by redgear is also very great and has lots of featuresi mostly used this mouse for fps games like csgo valorant overwatchbut the side buttons also help in building in fortniteonly issue is the build quality some party feel kinda loseits my first gaming mouse but damn its so good the grip is perfect and dpi is also good at this range you shoud go for it if you get it under rupees no words just excellent accuracy top notch feeling while in hande is awesome feels very big in hand very comfortable to hold for long time design is very goodnice mouse love it decent mouse with ecent priceif you are buying this mouse exclusively for gaming dont cause the polling rate is no different than lets say a cheap dell mouse you see at work exact polling rate of this mouse is hz which is very low if you want precise aiming in competitive but the redeeming feature might be the looks the rgb looks cool but you cant use just one single color it feels great in hand but my thumb has to pull back a lot to press the lower side button but that can be attributed to my long thumb the cables braided too so theres thatverdict great value is you can get it for around rs considering its looks and other subtle featuresa fine mouse for what its worth
3,it just good for beginners you can start your work using this one noise cancellation issue you can face while using this and some time connectivity problem also can face coz of its mm jack its not working well sometime overall its okay at this pricegood quality sound better than phone microphone it has a deep tone to it rather than compressed sounding audio from smartphone mic works with my nikon zgreat product for beginnerslike the product works good at this pricenice onesound good but capture ambiance sound not deduct ambiance soundi am very impressed this productbest mic
4,great watch good features easy and simple to use watch face is nice battery life is decent last for days sensors work well smooth controls and display is bright only issue is that after the watch came into contact with water it started malfunctioning power button not working bluetooth calling doesnt work and battery gets quickly drained despite having bluetooth offi have recently bought this product and i was not so happy and not worried as advertised this smart watch meets its purpose descent size and medium weight to wear alwaysfew of my suggestion to become a better watchtouch response can be improved touch accuracy is lessresolution can be still more betterneed to click on the button to see time or to awake instead of pressing button should have give touch to awakecan have provide some more option like finding phone and finding smart watch product is good worth the moneythere is a bit snag in wakeup mode while moving handsit takes time to on the screen automatically overall good performancebattery backup not good worst watch only day it will come if you charge bought it months back working fine call quality is good dont expect great touch sensitivityfound good and product finishing and features are superthe product is good with good battery lifenice product but the touchscreen and app could have been better

4,good quality product best suitable size for good quality video cameras like action camera but didnt like sellers packaging he did no effort for packing simply picked from storage and dropped in amazon bag then send for deliveryit might damage the product in transportation very irresponsible seller i had to instantly look it in device for damagebut it was working fine and memory card was very good qualityif you are looking to expand the memory for your nintendi switch oled this is the best and cheap options available the installation is quite easyhighly recommendedwrite speed is at normal with a minimal level of and peaks at in mobileupdatethe disappointing thing is reed speed i got upto mbps read and it wont goes beyond mbps but write speed sometimes peaks at mbps i got this memory card only for the purpose of read speed not for writing speedbecause i wont use this in any action camera or dslr only for mobile which needs atleast mbps for smooth performancei am totally disappointed for my purpose but satisfied according to priceso my conclusion if you are looking for a memory card for kk recording you can surely go for iti case of u are purchasing on seeing its read speed and also for mobile it wouldnt be a better optionexpensive productgoodnice memory cardthe delivered one was mbps write property i was expecting mbps write propertygb storage out of gb why answerit depends upon operating system some phones take mbgbsome phone take mbgbexample mi phone will show gb butsamsung will show gb onlysum up gb is given by manufacturerbut it depends upon format of phone reading the capacity interms of mb or mbwhile
4,it is very good product quality is decent but the only problem i m facing is that is incompatible with with my tablet and my mobile phoneif it was compatible it would be great and sometimes it just keep disconnecting from the device i dont know if its my device or its the product anyways its a good product to have all timesconnecting pin was a bit tight to insert to my macbook getting it for from this brand is what made me order this go for it if you work only with usb devices you can access devices at a time but not sure about the speed while switchinf the windows for now its quite okay to browse the files when one pen drive is connectedusb port is somewhat not easy to plug when connected to laptop its hard to remove it smoothlyserved the purpose and delivered as marketedi bought it for overall build sturdy and premium no doubt functionality usb port side one usb front my ssd gave ish mbs readwriteseq on the port less for random readwrite same ssd gave ishmax mbs readwriteseq on the porteven tho for me it is ok they couldve provided us with more highspeed portscord is too short and price too highbought this to use for connecting mouse and keyboard to my macbook and have been using this for the last months before buying this i looked at multiple products at various price ranges finally chose this product as this offers the brand assurance and is way cheaper compared to similar items from other reliable brands so far working really well nice way to use usba devices on macbook air m in a cheap price
4,the speakers sound is good and all the other feature are also at the best the only problem is the battery backup its normally about hr but that can be acceptable with this pricesmall but over all goodprice is too high for this product but sound quality is goodits like a pocket dynamiteloud and good bluetooth speaker tiny like big lemon bluetooth is flaky works for calls but again bluetooth slightly cuts off audio out is oki suggest go for next model up in category but this is good for its priceone of the best speaker i ever bought it looks small in size but the sound that comes from it is clear and good
4,the cover comes up with good foam on both of sides enough to protect the laptop its good for as it says inch laptops i dont know about the water resistance but except that it is goodaverage qualityproduct quality is good value for money but packaging was not good they folded while packing you can see mark on product added imagea bit bigger for mac m but overall the product is goodprice should be around maxgood productbuilt quality of product is excellentlove the quality and overall look of the laptop sleeve it has got a sleek minimalistic lookhas a god soft side from inside and protects the mac well

4,non returnable so now using this as it is bandwidth control is a must for this price range model was archer cgreat delivery from amaozn it was easy to setup as a extender signal is also good but not that great it can cover flat well signal breaks if moving upstairs or downstairs overall great purchase must buyneed little better customer supportgoodi expected much stronger signal meter away its okay working but not as expectedtp link is good productgood productdecided on buying this router from tplink after days of research reading reviews and talking to many people regarding different modelswas on a mbps connection with a netgear n router since which used to suffice for moderate usage till now however with increase in the number of devices like smart tv ipads and a laptop etc it necessitated an upgrade also considering the current workfromhome scenario which is bound to continue for the foreseeable future as well the internet usage was being stretched to its limit and the trusted netgear router simply couldnt match up to the increased bandwidth demandto capitalise on the current situation our current isp came out with interesting fibre broadband plans and we opted for a mbps connection that in turn needed a new router to utilize its optimum potential finally zeroed in on the tplink archer c after reading some horror stories of other available routers was also tempted to buy the ax considering theres barely any price difference but then came across a few reviews which stated that wifi is not entirely successfully implemented and might prove to be an hindrance to use with our current range of devicesorder delivered by amazon within a day full marks for the seamless delivery as always prime has truly been a booninstalled the router today installation via tether app was seamless isp guy helped with the pppoe signin process and released the mac id which was bound to our old router the whole process was done in mins and we were onlinethe dual bands are truly a boon have divided the devices at home equally between g and g as per usage as the router is close to the tv unit have connected it to g and also alternatively connected via the ethernet cable just in casespeed testsstarted off by streaming k content simultaneously on devices connected to g played seamlessly even with other devices like mobiles etc being connectedhave attached a few pictures for reference sitting near the router g download speed is mbps and upload is mbps g speed tested in the bedroom with a wall in between download mbps and upload mbps g speed in the same room as the router is download mbps and upload mbps this is quite surprising as a few reviews mentioned mbps will be the threshold for g used to get a maximum of mbps download on my old n speed test via the ethernet cable provided in thr box connected to the tv download mbps and upload mbpscouldnt have asked for more really this seems to be totally idealbuild quality of the device is decent and the antennas seem well enough to do the job however would have preferred that they were placed like other tplink models like the archer a so it would have been easier to move them in preferred directionsthe led lights are a little weirdly placed and not bright enough maybe im used to the prominent lights on my old router these are a blinkandmiss sort and you have to bend a little to check in case theres an issue one big element missing in this device is a usb port which is absolutely essential in todays age and expected to be included for this price range wonder whats the reason behind giving it a missi have sealed the extra lan ports with tape to protect from dust or moisture its a good practice the outer design of the router is quite sophisticated and stylish however im a little worried of dust accumulating in the intricate design on the top portionfunctionally though this seems to be a real good offering from tplink hope this device lives up to expectations in coming days allinall seems to be a worthy investment for the next few years considering an internet plan upgrade if anyhope i touched upon major points which might help other interested consumers in making a choice this product is recommended
4,i first used nonparker ink for my fountain pen and hesitantly switched to parker quink ink given the cost was many times higher than regular ink but it is worth every paise the quink ink is clearly worth it with its thick blue color and giving superb contrast on white paperbest productgoodnodislikei have a ink pot of pilot andi was thinking to buy the parker onerate is too high but quantity is too lowthe quantity is littlebest quality

4,i had been using a logitech mk for a couple of years before a couple of keys started getting iffy no spills or accidents with an overall positive impression of logitechs performance compared to my experience with similar from dell hp i decided to try the slightly cheaper and compact mkwhile i knew this would be more compact with fewer keys i feel i should highlight the disadvantages i can see immediately especially for users of fullsize keyboards at work refer image while my hands will get used to closer keys they also seem much less springy lower overall size is also too small to place on ones lap and type which i could with the other wireless keyboard especially during wfh big point is the much larger size of the dongle this will need to be removed and stashed carefully at home every time i throw my laptop into my bag for a meeting i never did this for mk and simply kept dongle fixed forever to my laptop usb port that dongle also had a slot inside the mouse for safekeeping which is not there in mk neither mouse nor keyboard has a switch off mk had switch on both mk mouse takes aa whereas mk takes battery mouse is shaped different lower arch and wider which may simply take adjusting feels a little cheaperwhile a real review can only be provided much later seeing how keysclicks perform over the long run and one hopes that logitech will have taken care of that quality while i dont have any complaints so far i feel paying a bit extra for the mk may suit many folks out there hope the review helps will update later if i see find any fundamental issues with timeproduct is good but lagging very muchnot enjoying satisfied with this productbad for meit is working fine till nowthe keyboard is good but pretty small when compared with regular keyboards it works well and keys and okexcellentgo fot it good product handy just connector is little bit big sizeworks properlyinitially noticed lag and then looked it up onlineit seems usb receiver faces interference when another port next to it is plugged in to other devicei had the lag of both mouse and keyboard actions but noticed that my usb receiver was plugged next to hdmi port which was also connected to a monitor i switched the usb receiver to another usb port on other side of laptop without any neighboring ports dont face lag nowtry to use a usb hub if you dont have a usb port away from existing used portsbuild quality and all are good but the batteries cap is little bit loose for the keyboard and mouse is totally fine
4,____________________technical specificationsheres the technical information of boat bassheads inear headphones the information provided below is as per the manufacturer boat bassheads have a frequency range of hz to khz it features mm drivers rated impedance of ohms comes with meter flat tangle free cable mm goldplated lshaped audio jack degrees sensitivity db db____________________built quality designi was not expecting metal built at this price range but to my surprise boat bassheads are fully made up of metal it has a diagonal gridlike texture on the buds which feels amazing on touch the metal construction gives boat bassheads a premium feel attractive appearance the cable used by boat on bassheads is flat with rubberized coating it is a tanglefree cable does its job well by decreasing the chances of the cable tangling despite the metal construction boat bassheads are very lightweight comes with a microphone lshaped mm audio jack which is again made up of metal overall the built quality is excellent for the price seems very durable the ear buds have proper l r labels and are clearly visible boat bassheads comes with medium sized silicone tips already installed outofthebox___________audio qualityto ensure that i can test the bassheads at their uppermost limit i used highquality mp files of kbps lossless audio formats like flac wav for smartphone listening i used poweramp music player tweaked settings every now and then to see their extreme capability for the computer i used itunes player vlc audio player i also tested these earphones on apple ipod iphone sony mp player all this went for more than days finally i had my resultsboat bassheads promised what they claimed they really are very bassy as compared to others during my tests with them i found that the audio quality is very good for the price the bass output is amazing and overpowers the vocals by default by tweaking the equalizer settings a bit i saw a good level of improvement in the vocals they were clearer than before but overall average the treble was again very good the highfrequency sounds were clear pleasant to ears the mids were average but overall the audio experience on boat bassheads was decent when listening to music the overall sound quality is amazing you can easily distinguish between different instruments sounds which is a good thing for extra bassy headphones______________________noise isolation comfortwhen it comes to noise isolation boat bassheads are very good at it they come with medium sized ear tip preinstalled which seemed perfect for my ears once the earphones are on i wasnt able to hear outside noise they sealed my ears completely delivered an immersive experience make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation comfort overall boat bassheads are comfortable but they seem a bit stiff somewhat awkward when used for longer periods since the housing is made up of metal you may find them popping out every now then when used during running jogging or any other sport or physical activity this didnt happen as often for me but for a friend they keep popping out every now then while running maybe the shape of ears has something to do with it an easy solution to this will be using the ear hooks which came along with it when using bassheads with ear hooks they were a bit uncomfortable initially but as i got used to them they were fine plus this stopped popping issue since the hooks keep a hold on themflat cable microphonethe cable is great i personally prefer flat cables and this earphone come with a perfect flat cable which is tangle free comes with a rubberized coating the cable does its job well the microphone is again exceptionally good it records voice with clarity with less to no disturbance or background noise during calls the person on the other end can clearly hear the voice with no background disturbance there is one button on the microphone which helps to pick upreject calls on the go without taking your phone out it can also be used to control music which is again a good to see in a budget friendly earphone like boat bassheads ____________________warranty priceboat bassheads comes with standard one year warranty so make sure you keep the purchase invoice safe in case you need it for warranty_____________final thoughtsive personally used boat bassheads inear headphones for more than two weeks average daily two hours of listening before writing this review and im pretty much impressed with them im personally a fan of extra bass iems and currently my primary iem is sony mdrxbap which again falls under extra bass category comparing sony mdrxbap with boat bassheads will be unfair since there is a big price difference between both of them but i would still like to add that bassheads did a great job and didnt disappoint me obviously it doesnt stand a chance in front of sony mdrxbap but still looking at the price of bassheads the quality they offer i was really very impressedboat bassheads turned out to be exceptional earphones after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices music players i can say that theyre amazing for the price a pure steal deal the bass output is amazing and is very intense ill recommend using correct size ear tips good quality music player like poweramp android for better bass output the treble is good vocals are average somewhere i feel that bass overpowers the vocals but by tweaking the equalizer a bit you can achieve better results the mids are again averagemy rating out of ____________________the verdicttaking everything into account overall im very impressed with boat bassheads the built quality is amazing the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass good overall soundstage tweaking the equalizer a bit can bring drastic improvements to other areas like vocals mids highs overall the vocal highs are good mids are average but still good for the price ill recommend these iems to bass lovers budgetconscious people who are looking for high quality durable earphones at a reasonable price genres like edm rock hiphop sound really great on them boat bassheads justify the price they come for the results are very good as compared to other earphones in same price rangehope i helped youthanksyes so you have heard that this is the best wired earphone under yes you can consider it to buy but there are few points to remember before buy from my user experience i can tell you this this is not comfortable at all it slips from ear mostly you feel pain in ear after using it never buy this for online class as it is not possible to wear it hours straightly after switching from boat basshead i feel that the bass is not good as the previous one i dont know why it should be better sound dont explode or go outside of the buds to as it go outside on boat headphone so its good feeling heavier on ears not as comfortable as realme buds though both are metal build for balance sound you can buy realme buds buy it only to listen music not for too long time do not consider it for online class and long time wear session hope it helped you its just my opinion from using boat boat boat realme buds mi basicits a very good product but i dont recommend buying this because earpiece is heavy and you need to keep adjusting it and pushing it inside

3,this mics sound quality is very good but if you are looking for a mic which you will use in your pc then dont buy this microphone because it doesnt come with a trrs to trs converter overall good mic and wire length is also average meter in this price range its very worth it to buy this mic but if you want to use in laptop or pc then buy maono au microphone which comes with a converter and it is also very good micnot suitable for dslr camerajust good for ytokay product is not good for anyone it is scrap and waste of moneynot too goodit has a good sound and audio quality it have not very good in noise cancellation it will filter some minute sound it is helpful for youtube video creatorsbut the clip is very hard so i cant fit it in shirtit is worth for the cost
3,audio quality is good for this price range the noise cancellation also works pretty well best thing is that it fits well in my ears the functionality of microphone is also good because it reduces the unwanted environmental noise for eg when you are talking to someone in a crowded placeone tap leftright pauseplaydouble tap leftright previousnextthree tap leftright volume four tap left music gamefour tap right base rock hifiright hold change anc no anc transparentleft hold bixby siri google assistanthold for longer time turn offthese are the touch controls for omega anc is not that much good but okay gives good backupfor a price range of it is good enc is okayno app or anything to equalize have to do it with built in mobile equalizernoice cancellation is not good its lower quality system otherwise sound quality is good bass is ok looking very nice good fittings touch sensor almost good workits a good set overall sometimes it doesnt autoconnect and i need to open bluetooth settings in my phonelaptops to manually connect which is little annoying for meother then latency it is not good for gaming environment sound is not good you cannot tell the direction of foot steps until its too close dont buy it for gaming other than gaming its a good earphone in this price rangegood product decent sound bass should have been better treble is slightly on the higher note anc works well and subdue ambient noisei liked itgood

4,i installed it in my asus tuf fxdt and i use it for gaming earlier it have gb ram after installing it total ram is gb and fps in game increased i am satisfied from this product i received a defective piece i already check my laptop before purchasing that which ram would be compatible and is my laptop really supports upgrading after thorough research i purchased this ramwhen i tried installing it my laptop showed a blank screen i tried switching ports on both the rams preinstalled and crucial but my laptop was working with the pre installed and was not with crucial one i tried all possible combinations and it was apparent that the ram i received was defectivei head straight to replace the product but there was no option for that no return option as well i only had one option to contact the customer care so i contacted them and explained the issue in detail they asked me to hold and connected me to an so called expert the expert did not ask me anything just asked me to upload a picture that i already did then so called expert asked me to upload the picture on the link that she would be sharing which i never received i even tried rating but thanks to the amazon ios app even that was not possible coz there was no scroll bar on the rating tab i do not know whether i would receive any support or not but this was a pathetic experience and i had never expected this from amazon it would be an end for this years old bond with amazon if i would not receive any support on thisi will update this if i receive some helpissue fixed after struggling days but ram is greatits better to install it with ssd i felt very good performance uplift in my laptop after installing both ssd this gb rammy laptop had gb ram before i ordered crucial ddr gb sodimm ram and its really increase multitask my coding experience also increase android studio take less time than before still i didnt play any game yetbut i will update you when i play any game in futurefirst of all let me clear any confusion for other buyer its r ram which i received clearly mentioned on the ram sticker gb operating at mhz if your existing ram in your laptop is operating less then mhz it will automatically reduce its mhz to default the ram which alredy installed in your laptop initially i doubted coz i dnt have much idea about all these electronic but after watching youtube videos i finally installed it and it workedmy laptop aspire a with gb installed ram now it is gblets c if my laptok gives good performancegood ram on a good price its a dual ranked mhz rammany say that you cant use a gb and gb in dual channel mode but believe me u canif u dont know about ur system configuration then before buying just scan with crusial scannergood ram with decent price easy to install and so far performance looks good have to test it during gaming but so far so good
3,my office pc ups legrand numeric ups digital exv is having only one led and beep codes this is not sufficient if we want more details however the unit is robust easy to disassemble easy to replace battery with generic battery having best transfer time less than milli sec min backup for cpu monitor when checked in view of this the legrand numeric ups digital exv should my the number one choice but it also has low user ratingsthe following brands came to my notice on search apc bxcin apc bxciin emerson liebert iton cx i have not considered microtek intex iball vguard etc may be they are goodthe technical parameters of the above all looked similar like generator compatibility avr highlowoverload protections but the transfer time specified for numeric is less than milli sec for apc milli sec typical and for liebert millisecondsapc bxcin is selected as my requirement is not for pc or laptop further search is not done for ups with communication port and auto save software and in view of better interface power led dual color charging led dual colour battery saver led it also has better backup and surge power than apc bxciin minus resettable thermal relaybased on the reviews there are four major issues i have noticed very old stock battery capacity expected to be in reduced condition resulting into low backup time or battery issue transit damages as it is bulky to its volume though it is better to purchase such items offline i still tried online in view of remote location no load protection it acts if very low load is connected eg just modem or less than w and battery saver mode is on after min people get confused it as giving only min backup it shouldnt be considered as a problem once known since additional loads can be connected or battery saver mode can be unselected if battery saver is enabled it shutdowns while min juice still left it shouldnt be considered as a problem since it can be unselected if selected intentionally or unintentionallyto reduce the above risks ms appario retail private ltd was chosen at lightening deal at rs rs the order was placed on the product is delivered in days on the original packing was wrapped in repeated turns of polyethylene the packing reached without any major distortions the original cartoon packing was in sealed condition however when it was opened some parts looseness sound was coming from the ups the same was reported to apc service center they registered the complaint and told me that the service person will visit within hours of working days further they have given clearance to put the ups in servicefirst it was charged fully while ups in off condition charging light was on while charging and it became off after charging now the ups was made on by power button it is to be pressed and hold for not less than second before release or release after beep tone connected to pc with inch led tv initially some repeated chattering without any power interruption to the load was happening if power input is kept off on battery it was happening some timeswhen it is on battery beep sound was occurring every sec against apc manual spec of secit withstood for minutes for the pc with inch led tv on battery battery save mode was in off conditionfurther it got switched off within sec of low battery alarm against sec specified in the manualthe manufacturing date as per slip glued on original packing was nov photo attached but the test and quality passing date is hrs photo attachedas my load is more than w i can put it on battery saver mode the battery saver button to be pressed and hold for not lessthan seconds before release to change the state this is minor but the holding time is no where written in the manualthe ups body temperature appears to be on higher side when compared to numeric installed at office under similar ambient temperature while on load with input mains as well as while in off condition without charging but connected to mainsthe above is initial experience only any updates shall be shared in futurenote this item isnt eligible for returnfor safety reasons items containing flammable liquids or gases cant be returned to amazon for more information or help please contact themif you want return facility search for other alternativesupdate the service person called me on and informed about his planned visit on the service person visited in the morning of and disassembled the ups there was a minor play with the battery the whole casing is of plastic one side cover opens including top as one part the play may be due to design manufacturing tolerances the pcb and the transformer were already firmly fastened to body and all connections were also tight hence the looseness is acceptable the battery manufacturing date was oct i agreed for his optional proposal to replace with a new sealed battery but manufactured in sept the chattering may be relevant to building wiring as it is not happening with main sockets in other rooms or if we remove ups input plug from the same socket see next update for accurate reason in the whole the service persons only concern was hotter transformer based on his experience but it will be replaced only if it failsprompt response of service center is appreciable that too for an interior of km from service center located at state capital and it compliments the non return policyupdate it is fully charged with replaced battery and backup time was tested with the same load as above but this time large improvements were observed in the backup time and parameters difficult to reason out as belowbackup time is min until some different type of blinking of power led different type of beeps happens for few seconds may be relevant to battery saver mode and however it got normalized in auto after min further the battery low blinking of power led occurred hence total min against min of earlier experience as above and these beeps occurred for seconds before it tripped against seconds of earlier experience as above but power led was glowing for every few seconds till further seconds in off conditionbattery on beep was occurring for every seconds min to indicate the load is on battery against every second earlier experience as above i was totally involved with service person as it has to protect very costly bulky and distant service partner type equipment at my home he has replaced only battery and he has not even removed the pcb but how so many wonders have happened is yet to be analyzed and reasoned outnote i nonrmsmultimeter does not properly read the voltage of a ups that uses stepped approximated output sine wave while on battery hence output voltage of a vac ups is measured to be between vac when on batteryii low voltage cut off will act if any separate low voltage high voltage cutoff protection is used at outlet of ups while on batteryiii chattering may take place at ups if any separate surge protection is used at ups outletiv some body already advised not to use any surge protection at input to upsv apc service person informed that apc ups will not on if house is not properly grounded earthing is to be proper to protect from surgesvi if ups is on battery with battery saver mode enabled ie mains off it will give only min backup to loads less than w as no load protection acts however if the load is more than w it shutdowns while min juice still left ie if we disable battery saver mode we will get min more backup powerfrom the above the ups is now functioning as per specifications but one star of apc is reduced against initial issues of equipment though super fast response exists from their service center stars to ms appario retail private ltd the seller stars to the apc service center and stars to courier ms delivery for safe and fast deliveryupdate after months of use backup time testing ignoring erroneous tests in betweenthe ups was made on and battery saver was made off due to this the ups started self charging further and i have waited till the charging is completed now the tv as monitor with pc were made on it took upto amp during cold boot amp measured with clamp meter while mains is on once the pc stabilised a the mains is switched off now it gavea backup of minutes with beep every minute and given repeated beeps at th min again every min one beep started for min after this repeated beeps occurred for second and ups got tripped hence i got minutes and seconds in total in view of this the star rating is retained at starone more observation is that its transformer temperature is high while it is on battery that means more energy is being wasted by transformeri got the battery replaced one more time on under warranty as backup time reduced to min under the same conditions and load with new battery i am getting minutes hence the apc is being letdown by battery manufacturer where apc quality person should have control after warranty i will install battery from exide and seeprosthe device is sleek small and blends into the environmentconsmakes a lot of noisei bought this primarily to support my television sony xrxk to handle the switch from generators to mains for secs it is not sufficient to do that and the tv switches on and off continuously when running on ups power im not sure what the problem is as the wattage is sufficientif you have a similar use case as mine better consult a local inverter shop and get a ups that fits your requirement else you will end up with dead weighteasy to installmy pc has a w psu with bronze effeciency but installed components are not supposed to go beyond watts under max load this ups shuts down as soon as my gpu gtx reaches then i used it for my printer but as soon as i hit print the ups shuts down so its useless there as wellnow its attached to my tv router and speakers atleast i can watch netflix uninterruptedim getting trouble in this i think this is not working properly where should i returnvalue for money so far working goodsmall but big life of batteryit is good for electricity stability

3,updated overall you really get what you pay for they serve the purpose of a decent pair of tws for basic quality calls and music listening main problem i noticed was with the pairing and connection strength as they routinely lose signal for no apparent reason once or twice i had issue of only one of the buds getting paired and had to reset the other one to get it pairedif you have paired these to one device and try to pair to another one without disconnecting from first it simply doesnt work this is starting to get annoying but maybe ill get used to it well seethis is just day review of these got them for rs on some offer on amazon ill post updates later on hope this is helpful for anyone interestedpackage the packaging is quite decent for such a low price comes with the tws earphones fitted with medium earplugs fitted inside the case also included are a very short usb c cable and two additional earplugs small and large package includes some noise stickers and a pretty good user manual and warranty instruction cardbuild was immediately dissapointed with the plastic case as the lid was rattling and not confidence boosting will use it for a while to see if my worries are unfounded the earphones themselves are rather sturdy feeling in hand they fit very snuggly into the case and there is no evident feel of them coming lose or rattling within the casecomfort this is very subjective and each ear is different its one of the reaonss i wanted to get a cheap tws to see if im ok with the form factor for long hours the prefitted medium size earplugs were not comfortable so i switched to the small size ones and after about mins i forgot i was even wearing them the earbuds are very lightweight owing to the plastic build but upside is that they dont cause any strain even after an hour of continuous use one thing to note is that if you have gandhi ears then the fit might be a little awkward i should know my ears covered the touch areas of the buds so i had to fiddle around a bit if i wanted to do any of the touch actions ymmvsound quality i liked them im no audiophile but they have decent volume and satisfactory levels of bass and separation i tried my usual test at and they fared quite well the treble maxes out at khz post which you hear nothing at all but this is to be expected at the price point there was noticeable vibrations creeping in at below hz but the l and r drivers seem to be matched well and all of the panning tests were quite decent i feel this definitely punches above its price pointcall quality in a low to no outside noise environment the microphones were very good there was no lag and the person on the other side said my voice was very clear but things take a steep fall as soon as little noise is present and you start sounding like youre inside a well seems the mics cant figure out how to filter out your voice so they end up trashing the call quality overall you get what you pay for hererange max i got was around m not sure how they tested and got m as advertised any disruptions like a wall will simply break the connection but they connected back automatically every time so far so i guess thats passablepairing update on th aug major issue here is that if already paired to a device like a laptop they simply are unable to be paired to another device like your phone you have to unpair from the first device and then try to pair again had issues like only one of the buds pairing as wellhave to fiddle around to get it to work and is not convenienti dont have a phone to test the fast pair features actually im not even sure these support it anyway the earphones go into pairing mode as soon as you remove them from the case and i was able to pair with no problems on multiple phones they will auto pair post this initial setup to previously paired devices i could not find any way to control the pairing mode though you have to live with what it comes with as there is no app or anything to control what it does they switch off pairing mode once you put them in the case so hopefully that means the battery would be saved a littlebattery life way too early to tell anything will share my experience post one week and one month but they came around charged in the box and i have stated to charge the case box says it will take hrs to fully charge it and there are basic indicators like a flashing red led for charging which turns solid red once done the earphones also have leds that blink red white to indicate pairing low battery etcsync issues none so far but have seen many such reports and reviews wherein the l and r earphones seem to go out of sync on similar low price twses so will see if i face any such problemsthese are the primary areas that i am concerned with while evaluating any tws so will share how my experience is after a while so far im happy with themhi my name is akshayi used this product and this is very good in sound and valuable moneygood in calling alsoeverything is perfectgood sound qualitybuds are very good quality with great noise cancellation featurewhen we received this order box is already opened like thisi was not expected at allwhat i dont like is the

4,ive just started using it i cant say much about its sturdiness lookwise it does feel sturdy but depending on the usages it will show how long ot will lastat all stages one side of the stand doesnt fit properlynot that perfect one side has a little gapquite satisified with the product after about weeks of use value for the money ergonomics is satisfactory but still it needs to be looked into from the looks of it it would have a long term durability alsothis is an awesome product that i have purchased till date for my wfh purpose it can hold laptop very well it can be adjusted for different heights grip to the table is really good it helps to view the laptop with required angle easy to carry looks really great on a black table classic silver piece packaging is also very good starsi got this delivered today and tried it out my laptop is kg and inches a bit of a heavy machinewhile the stand held my laptop it did not fit properly because of the laptops weight or the size the front of the laptop raises instead of staying on the padded notches have to move the machine forward a bit for it to stay onif you want to use it as simply a stand where you set the laptop and use external devices to use it like the mouse gamepad or the keyboard it is fine you can go for itif you want to use the machine itself when on the stand touchpad and keyboard you might face some issues using it directly is making the machine a bit wobblywill test it out with heavy work gaming to see how the temperature holds might edit the review and the rating after using it a bitthe product itself is awesome and in modern day where ease to carry and compact products are preferred it is a good choice my only reason to give stars and removing one out of five is the product latches linkagesarms that set the level of elevation angle are bit free and can be undone from one of either side with a slight jerk while the second side latch supports all the weight in the meantimeit is very convenient and compact to carry along with you definitely value for money

4,easy to installworking great recommended for light useif you want to use hard disks without lagging then i will suggest to buy self powered usb hubthe product does what it is intended to dohowever it does not compliment the sleek laptop i use it with probably a direct plug in extension no cord would be a much better optionneeded a portable usb extension headphones keyboard and mouse serves the purpose for an indoor setting have explained why it is not an outdoor device under the conspros nice design sleek unobtrusive suits some work environments for those who have limited table estate go for models that have vertical usb slots saves space this is for those who can have it flat next to the laptopcomputer check image works well for audio hids and great for data transferobservation an interesting observation when using usb keyboard the usb drive is as if not more sensitive than direct typing with mechanical usb keyboards there is a latency but chiclet and usb dongle based wireless keyboards seem to work well usb or wireless usb rf mouse works perfectly very little noticeable latency not for gaming purposes keyboardsmicejoysticks etc this is a no brainer in rapid response gaming environments were latency is life or death an extension is not an optioncons check imagethe usb female slots in the extension are shallow the male plugs do not go in fully there is cm of the metal plug exposed this may be a risk in exposedoutdoor environments humidity increases the chances of electric shock and dust being an insulator may cause static electricity build up the worst case is if a conductor falls across the exposed points the whole system can short outsuggest the designers take this into consideration for their next batch of products the depth of the usb slots needs to accommodate the full length of the usb plugsfunctionally it works design leaves a lot wanting go for it if are sure you can be safe go for a different model if you need this for outdoor useupdate th nov on connecting the keyboard to the usb drive there seems to be an increased latency and sometimes the keyboard does not respond as anticipated the text does not appear on the screen immediately and sometimes a particular letter just cascades repeatedly and one has to press backspace often to delete the excess letters for data transfer it works fine but has lower speeds when all four slots are being used expected probablyworks well and does the jobi like it very muchvalue for moneyproduct is excellent just that wire is very short rest all goodusing in laptopuseful usb multiplier and works well for headsets too was apprehensive earlier if it deteriorates the audio qualityonly drawback is the length of cable as it keeps protruding out of laptop bag
4,overall a nice thing to have but it would be better if you could provide a holder for this particular black varient of case covergoodvalue for moneyi like the quality is above expectation you can buy this product your laptop will be save from scratches and damagesits a good product anyone can go for itworth the pricesoftthick and good cushioning as per the pricebuilt quality of product is excellentuser friendly and nice to hold
4,after testing a couple of times it seemed as if the fans didnt impact the cooling experience as much as id hope and most of the work was done by the stand raising the laptop itselfthis laptops fans started failing a couple of months after purchase and now make quite an annoying noise hence referring my above statement if you experience this noise it would be best to just leave it turned off if you dont care about the small additional coolingit do cooling but not that like i was expectingquality is nice having fans n two separate controls controls four fans n nd control for middle fan so depending upon laptop battery n cooling required power can be distributed built quality is good although it is very light weight design is superb having two usb ports so even one fails second would be avail which will increase life of this product its throwing really cool air through small honeycombs can feel with hands so its cooling my laptop really well just i had a small issue about fans that sometime if pad gets tilted before starting i have to tap it lightly to start it may be its a balancing issue but its not much problem for me as it occurs only sometimes n it works very well all time so recommend everyone to buygood producti like the product and the performance also but the cost is too high i think they need to reduce the price according to the performancefor office use it is good adjustable is slightly okaybuild quality and fan quality is good best for price rpmlooks goodquality is also goodnot for heavy gamingi am using it for video editing premier proworks fine but fan sound is high
4,this is good very light and thin but if gap visible when your screen closes very tightlyneed of this didnt occur to me till i watched snowden recently design and hence operation are superbthey work for what they are designed forits meant to cover your privacy and it does well very slim and adhesive is also good enough and sticks around i applied it on my dell latitude and only observation is while closing lid i kinda feel its not properly closed and locked well this wont be a problem when you shutdown the laptop consider this with a touchscreen laptop would be slight cumbersome anyways satisfied with the main purpose to protect privacy good adhesion but doesnt fit all the laptops camerasgood but it little bump but use full for security purposesworth buying it does the job
4,i wish it would have come up with the feature of auto switch off as of now its manual it kills batteryoverall good for normal workits so smooth to use this no pressure on handsmouse is working very fine and look also awesome but little smallused it for a while and it always court peoples attention because of nice design but not made for gaming for suregoodperformance is good but the mouse is so slim that it feels uncomfortable because i am not used to holding such slim micei just received it and posting my initial thoughtswill have to see if i get used to holding itvery smooth sleek and beautiful matched my silver black laptop colors
3,at rs its a great deal i use it for mobile vloggingnoice cancellation is not workingvalue of money good mike worth moneyvery nice mic in this price rangeafter seeing many microphone i found thisi bought it becuase of its good ratings and reviews and in a buget price this is best for beginnersthe first time i had ordered this mic i received in a amazon plastic bag and the product box inside was completely damaged and was sealed using cello tape also the mic seller sent me was damaged and had low quality audio it was a duplicatebut when i replaced i received the packing in a cardboard box but still the inner box had a few damagesthe mix received inside was goodhere is a detailed review of the mic the quality quality overall nice the wire might seem filthy and weak but in reality when i tested it it was indeed a bit durable it can easily sustain a bit of a pull and twist just mind the spots when the wire meets the audio jack and the mic sound quality sound quality is really nice but but but before you think of buying it read the paragraph below of noise cancellation the mic catches sound equally even if you are from far away or close to it noise cancellation this is a major point i used to mic a lot for testing purposes let me share my experience i tested it in different environmentsa in a closed room with ac and total silence in such environment you will get crisp sound like a boom microphone but you will also receive a bit of white noise or background static noise which you can easily reduce using the noise reduction featureb in a room with ceiling fan on and moderate noise still seems good but not great your vocals would still be crispy and clear but the background noise will increase still if you use nice noise reduction software like audacity it will sound great adding background music to your video would helpc in a room with standing fan on and high noise not recommended at all not only this mic but any mic would capture a ton of noise to express statistically there will be atleast noise of wind whooshing in the backgroundd the same high noise room with windows open you will die doing noise reduction not gonna lie the background noise increases by times dont try thisthe pop filter or the sponge on the top of the mic helps a lot when you are speaking close to the mic a lot of air goes in while speaking so when the filter is attached the output sound does not have air whooshing but with the filter removed the output sound is only airnow to sum upmic is overall good noise cancellation is not great but yeah for the price range it is the bestrecording tips record in a silent room with ac or else turn on the fan at the least speed so it doesnt make much noise use the collar clip to place the mic dont hold it in hand i mean this is common sense p if transmission lines electricity wires which are above the head go from close to your room i would recommend changing roomsnow the reason for this is that sometimes the mic can catch electromagnetic intefrerence this maono mic wont catch it but i recommend this for generic mics do noise reduction in audacity it is very effective than the inbuilt noise reduction tools in video editors also it is very easyalso boya bym mic sounds almost the same as this mic there is only like difference in noise cancellation but i would still give both of them stars for noise cancellationthats ithope you understand what i mean to saypeace outnice
4,it was easy to assemble the manual explains the procedure of assembly for both with and without resting pad and the height can be adjusted accordingly just felt it is not sturdy enoughthe product packaging was good and clean while assembling i could see there are minute scratches other than that it looks good and sturdygood one using for office work and my wife using for vegetable cutting purpose also have been more sturdy and the fittings attached to the table top are easily felt which feels cheap pros are good for wfh and if you have budget constraint angles and height adjustment is best you can easily adjust the height to any chair you are usinggood
4,when you use its okay producti am using and dont find any problem nice product good quality and easy to managethe best thing about it is that its super light weight and small so its wasy to carry almost everythinggo for itgood for landscape modei liked low priceniceok
4,this is review is primarily focused on sound qualitythe term bass is used losely one doesnt expect true bass from such small driversshorter versionboat stone very loud loud and somewhat uneven bass mids are a bit supressed somewhat muffled midrange decent treble a loud bassy speakernakamichi speck barely louder than the w stone mids clearer than bass much much lower than if looking for vfm rule this one out unless this is on a big discount and others arent overall fairly even sound at a questionable price and volumeboat more bass than expected of a tiny w speaker but lesser than speck and way lesser than excellent midrange and terble much lounder than what you may expect of a w speaker amazing speaker in a tiny package with insufficent basslonger versioni have had the for years and many have asked me to order it for them it is an excellent tiny satisfying package the midrange vocals and treble is excellent and matches speakers several times it price if bass is not what you are after you are unlikely to find a better package even at a much higher price point especially if you care for even soundby even sound i mean all relevant frequencies produced fairly well no major suppression or enhancementi checked the others as i usually hear music on a semipro system and the insufficent bass lowermids bothered menakamichi used to be a japanese company making very high end tape decks in the s so the benchmarks were high now it is a china based company the w raised expectations further as said it is barely louder than the w stone it is fairly even sound but not a significant enough improvement in bass over the if you dont care about the money and want something better than the with even sound this could be it the mids and terble are a tiny bit better in the speck also has a larger battery giving substantially longer backup and better water protection useful if you use yours in the smallest room of the house the stone is miles ahead in bass and loudness if that is what you care for amongst the your choice is simple the bass is uneven however all three speakers have memberanes in the inner shell acting as passive bass radiators one should not expect much nuance in bass from those if a thump is what you care for yes it is certainly there for the size with somewhat uncontrolled bass the midrange is compromised somewhat suppressed and somewhat muffled no it is not major and many mgiht not even really notice it much the transiton between mid and lowermidsbass isnt great one usually doesnt expect as much from such speakers but the boat stone set the bar high very highkeep the boat stone at an angle such that the drivers speaker are in the direction of your ears it makes the midrange a bit better reduces the bass a bit but makes the sound more even tough it is impractical to keep it so it makes the sound a lot closer to what i desiresome extrasplacement of these speakers makes a big difference keep them about away from a wall ideally a corner for enhanced bass and fuller soundif you look at teardown videos youll notice that the has much bigger magnets than the others it is a heavy speaker i like that since it keeps it stable and the rubber on the side helps further it is well designed except the and volume buttons should have been interchanged for intuitive usethe can also be placed vertically that too changes the sound lesser bass and possibly a bit clearer on the whole reduced bass less intrusion into the mids in such speakersspeaker characterics change subtly over odd hours of use often quite prominent in the first hour so do not form an opnion before running them in for about an hourconclusionnakamichi speck more even sound than the other two not at all as loud as expected better waterprof rating bigger battery high priced despite chinese buy if you dont care for the money volume and are okay wihtout much bassboat stone it is a star excellent even sound however the lack of bass as compared to the others pulls it back if you are on a budget or if you dont care much for bass especially for lecturesdocumentaries or vocal music this is brilliant i have used it for longboat heavy loud lots of bass if you can deal with the somewhat and it is not big unevenness and slightly muffled sound it is a good packagefor my needs i added the to my equipment list while keeping the ps this was my way of giving back to the community for the numerous reviews i have gained fromsoundits okay to buysound is not much loud its below my expectations low price awesome sound battery life should be more so cutting down star but overall good gives feeling of home theatre multiple connectivity is also goodloved the product

4,working as described but too early to comment easy to install and performance under observationrequest to hold return instruction and reordering for replacementno manual intervention needed it works seamlessly when power cuts happened provides to hours backupi bought of these ups for my home and it works perfectly as explained no drop in internet speed while on ups modern and router never disconnect alsoi have tested this ups without electricity for hours by that time electricity came so dont know about full backupgood ups and works finetldrbattery backup goodsmall comfyconsit reboots the wifi everytime when there is power cutsuperb product when it stopped working the manufacturer got is repaired and sent me back after that the backup is also good around hrsworking as expected so far on power cut automatically switches to ups mode it gives me backup for around hours for my huawei router after few months of usage will update the review accordingly year home pick up warranty is the usp for this devicewe do not have a inverter installed because our apartment building has dg backup but it took a few seconds for the dg to turn on due to which my router turned off so this device works perfectly well to cover the few seconds of no electricity it may last for hours as they advertise i had to buy a power splitter cable because i run the media and router both with this backup device and they both work perfectly fine during powercuts
4,after i changed from my slow gb hdd to this ssd feels like i was living in a stone age my pc started to run as smoothly as i could have ever imagined although i am not a gamer but can differentiate the performance of my experience one who wants to try out the ssd should have this one as the perfect choiceconfusing which one buying but after buying this one is best and speed up my pc packaging like no value for money box is band from corneri found the startup of the ssd slower like if u turn on a pc the first thing that kicks in motherboard then gpu cup and right after that the ssd in this case i found the ssd took about seconds and a delayed response to startup but when ever it didnt start it was quick dont know probably an issue with my psu or somethinghands down go for itquite nice sleek designbuild material is plasticbut one thing i found odd is that the hdd cover that when i put on it and when applied screws then the screws was very hard to put last holes were a little misaligned but after a little bit of force it fitsbought this product in nov easy to install and the performance is goodi installed into my yr old desktop now my i is showing its level best compared to my old hdd its superb to usego for it without any second thoughtone suggestion if just buying to boost performance and for desktop go for gb version to keep the os and keep the existing hdd as well attached as extended internal driveused to upgrade the speed and performance of my old laptop works as expectedat first i would like to suggest to look for the rating of the seller selling electronic products before ordering this i ordered a similiar product crucial ssdgb but instead i got a toshiba hdd of gb that too loaded with photo and word document of some guy i contacted amazon and they refunded me right away then i placed this order after searching for rating of this seller which i found legit the ssd is good i installed it in my asus laptop the laptop is running with gigs of ram i gen processor and this ssd after installing it boot up within seconds whereas my previous hdd takes nearly about minutes

4,i bought it when i watched an instagram influencer showed this product and wanted to try hands on thisquality wise its really good and since its made by logitech which has been in the market from too many years in pc accessories so less doubtful about its durability the best features once you pair your different devices to this keyboard using bluetooth switching connectivity is super fast like you wont feel any lag in connectivity the instructions strap helps to well understand this product i bought at k but i know its price had dropped to k during diwali salethings i hate about this product i felt it would be lightweight but it isnt buttons are rounded but yes gives mechanical keyboard feel which is great for gaming buttons are too close to each other so your hands will take sometime to adjust and also the arrow keys are slim which dont matter because as gamer you rarely use arrow keys its always wasd but yes will be problematic if you play fifa where there is extreme usage of arrow keysso for overall experiencegood portable keyboard i can list out the pros and conspros good connectivity with macbook pro latest os macbook keys are mapped properly as expected portable simultaneous connectivity with devicescons not an ergonomic keyboard its flat and doesnt have any option to incline up dont have backlight keys you can not see the keys in dark room keys are slightly hard to press i think due to rubber dome enter key i feel is smaller which cant be sensed without seeing the keyboardoverall my purpose got fulfilled as i am able to use it with my macbook pro after struggling with logitech r combothe keyboard is really good and it has a good built quality and the only con is that there is no indication of whether the caps lock is on or offpros easy to use keys feels like mechanical keyboard can connect devices supports mac and windows place holder for mobile devices however i use it to place a pencons expensive very heavy feels like macbook air there is lag in connection whenever you turn on your laptopprice is litter highwhat an excellent product i got my hands on smooth working and connect to different gadgets at the same time and u can work on any of them buttons are of good size so typing is easy and fast the inbuilt holder for gadgets is really solid and helping and its connect to iphone alsoonly uses for typing if horizontal view is suitable to see what we typingthink twice before buyingnot working properly on macbook pro switches to junk characters frequently which is really frustratinghow did i fix the keyboard switches to symboljunk characters when the option key is pressed so i had to disable the option key in the keyboard and live with itapart from that above problem its a good looking keyboard the keys are smooth to handle due to its container for tabletphones the product is not as compact as you might be expecting
4,the v product will not work with most type of modems its always better to purchase their va product i have used va product for months and it stopped working after that when i contacted the customer care they told me that i should have purchased there a product anyway they have provided the warranty also provided an option to upgrade the product to a at a discounted rate instead of replacing the current onethe product is good will require an additional y splitter cableproduct is very goodusing since nd dec no issuesvalue for money effective in cutting off and cutting in during an outage normal router can be supported by up to hours on this even after years of use if there is not much power outage recommend to at least switch off power supply a couple of times every month and have the battery support this for a couple of hourspurchased ups va works fine with jio fibre va and provide good backup but little costly as compare to ups va which is not compatible with my jio fibrei ordered v a model for my digisol wifiafter installation the product was turning off once the power goesso i called resonate customer care and they told as your digisol wifi is not supports v a and they suggested to buy a v a upsbefore purchase please call resonate customer careamazing product very helpful at times off power cutthis is best to avoid power cut issues pretty decent power backup for home wifi

4,ive been using the watch for a while now and i got to say i love it the battery lasts around days not days you do get around day battery life if you disable all features of the watch overall i like the call quality and display touchi got this product today and watch is great in budget and performance theres only one major problem that the button is not good but the other things are like speaker mic display etc are goodthe watch is good but the product that i got was defective after talking to the fire bolt company they give me new watch watch is value for money go for itthe watch is stylish sleek and built quality is goodin this price range its a catchall over good but volume increase and decrease not working while play the musici gv this feedback after using months good watch lekin jab recive kia watch on tha pm me alarm lagana bohut zaroori hota he but nhi lagte he sirf am me lga skte hai very disappointed baki battery backup is good looks achcha haicomfortable haiits a good watch but not switching on right now due to some issueamazing watch amazing colour just bought yesterday will share feedback again after the usage
3,i have received this product with a torn packet missing cable and user manual it seems incomplete product and the same airtel sim gives me a strong network but here i foud it slower than my mobile network its fine it might be the problem of network but the cable shouldnt be missing it seems someone taken while shipping because i got the packet broken however i received the wifi with battery and i use my own cable to charge itoverall satisfiednice workingi faced much tower problemit is better than mobile hotspot but its battery backup is not goodeven with a g sim the network speed is really low and connection is patchy its ok if you are using it for personal surfing but not a good fit for office worksatisfied with the productwhen i connect only device then ok but when multiple device connecting it is hitting abnormally within minute then backup reduce maximum hours
4,the cable looks exactly as it is shown in the picture i cant say about durability of this product because i have purchase this on th december after to months i will update my review about the durabilityand the cable works finegood oneused it for a long time had no complainsgoodthanksworks wellperfect for laptop chargingits good to have it for rs delivered in days
4,edit this doesnt change my review actually it probably makes it lean even heavier towards the star than star rating but i actually sat on the keyboard while it was on my chair im an absolute unit of a dude weighing kg and the keyboard wasnt affected at all im genuinely surprisedfirst of all id give this a instead of the but i rounded it up instead of down because theres more to like than dislikeproduct was delivered promptly but the packaging was in rough shape when i unpacked it the keyboard had three missing keys iirc it was left alt z and the windows keys i turned over the box and dumped everything and voila the missing keys fell out not off to a great start but i slapped those keys on which was very straightforward meaning that replacing keycaps in the future will be relatively easy and plugged in the receiver to my laptop no setup or rd party software necessary it just started working instantly pretty seamlessi only use the keyboard when i connect my laptop to my tv and im sitting at a distance i use my laptops keyboard otherwise i absolutely love the keyboard i was expecting it to feel wonky and cheap but it actually feels decent its not super premium but its much better than what i was expecting for the price it has flip stands on the back to raise it and an onoff switch if you want to conserve battery the keys themselves are full sized and as someone with larger hands i really appreciate it the curve around the space bar looks cool but i dont think it adds anything ergonomically the typing experience is nice the keys have enough feedback to them not mechanical levels obviously but still satisfying enough the caps lock key has a little raised bit to it so you can feel it without looking at it and dont accidentally hit it while typing neat little addition the shortcutmedia keys on top all work fine with windows theres not much else to say about the keyboard it should be more than sufficient for everyday officebrowsingschool tasks and will be good and comfy for people who type a lot do not buy this expecting a gaming level keyboard with antighosting etc or buy it expecting to have the durability of a true mechanical keyboard i was initially going to mark it down for not having any backlight at all but given the budget thats understandable and acceptable overall i very much like the keyboard and find it to be above par for what you paythe mouse on the other hand no pun intended is mediocre at best the build quality is not good it does not feel good when you use either of the click buttons you can feel the inner mechanisms groaning like its gonna fall apart at any time the mouse also starts lagging randomly the lag only lasts a couple of seconds but it occurs enough to be an annoyance also it just doesnt feel good in your palm i have an amazon basics mouse that i purchased while i was in the us for rs and that thing feels so much sturdier and better built than this it also has no lagging issues and the clicks feel smooth even after a few years of useas an overall package i would say its decent for the price there are lots of other sets in this price range and i picked this literally because of the logitech branding since i own a few other logitech products and enjoy them a lot the keyboard is doing all the heavy lifting here and carrying its mouse friend i hope they improve the mouse going forward because then this would be the best combo in this range as it stands right now its fairly indistinguishable from its competitorsrecommended for people looking for an affordable wireless set for everyday computer work and people who type a lotnot recommended for gaming or any form of power users it might work for single player games like city builders grand strategy rtses etc but i would not recommend it for any form of shooters especially online the mouse simply isnt up to taskthe keyboard is good and working nice for me the mouse is too small and not able to use properly and getting pain after using for very less time only it will be good if the mouse is in regular size also the mouse is lagging a bit even after changing the settingsi using this product since one year not any problem foundeven battery cell not changei dont really know if its worth the cost or not but i mainly prefer silent typing and mouse clicks ergonomic is also a must as i use these for long hourscurrently i use logitech m mouse which is really awesome and makes almost no noise at allgreat producti have been using this product for years its battery is great still running the keys could get hard with time therefore i had to use wd to lubricate them after years some random keys have stopped working such del semicolon numpad the mouses right click isnt functioning anymore the left click has irritating double click issue so not suited for fps games speed and connection is adequate no lag noticed the keyboard collects a lot of dust so better to cover it ergonomics are great no issue with that if youre looking for a longer size keyboard for approx years of proper functioning for daily or official use then it is a good purchase mouse is small and comfortable even for left handed people keep in mind the keys will become stiff over timei purchased it for my personal use which includes mostly working it has good connectivity both for keyboard and mouse i have not faced any issue with it i have not tested its performanace

3,let me start with something no one writes aboutuipower on hold the center button for seconds and the earphones with say in a japaneseindian womans voice power on battery about she does not sound chinese like the cheap chinese headphones her voice volume level is not very high eitherbt pairingturn off the headset press and hold to center button but keep holding the same button the headsets voice will say bluetooth pairing once connected it will say bluetooth connected if bt disconnects the voice says bluetooth disconnectednext trackpress and hold the button for seconds and the headset will make a cute chime and load the next song in the playlist of any app i like this feature of the chime because this way i know the headset has accepted the command and loading the next track however holding the button for second everytime you want to change songs can get annoying and painful if you want to skip a couple of songs of just skipping endlessly waiting for the right song to play buttons arent very soft but do have a tactile click to ensure you feel the click when pressedpower off just like power on hold the center button for seconds and the headset will turn offvolume

controller to denote volume coloured dots on the plastic controller to denotr left and right channelear plugs are colour coded and fit very well in my ears most of the ear plugs fall out of my ears while talking these dont i use the smallest onewhat does sony offera very neat guide on how to insert the ear plugs in your ears the most comfortable way and ensure the best seal for clear audio ive never known that you can pull you ear up from the top corner and gently place the ear plug into your ear canal once placed comfortably drop the ear and let the ear canal seal inaudio app its basically a music player designed to detect the sony earphones if you use spotify you can use this app to setup an equaliser it plays mp from your storage too my phone already has a built in equalizer i dont use any eq because the sound stage on these is flat so all types of audio sounds greatfaqis it flimsyno but feels like you might damage it if youre not carefuldoes it really last hryes ive tested it sort of and never managed to run out of batteryhow much did you spend on itkaudio lagnone i tested it with android tv lg web os android phone ps and ipad no issues of lag or disconnection or audio drop on super quiet moments of the songbassvery decent and controlledvocalsvery cleartreblesharp and crisploudnessyou can listen at full volume without much discomfort but id suggest not toi compared it with jbl wave tws the sound is very similar but a we bit less bass on flat eq better than boat airdopes better than oneplus bulletszafter using it for a week i returned itheres my understandingprosmusic quality mids and highs are well defined if u want u can add bass from eq that also provides bass with quality not boomy and unsubtle fast pairing pairs instantly hardware level eq u can tweek it to your own desire good mic qualitycons no multi pair support ie u cant switch between ur lap and mobile instantly or in standby cable quality the provided cable are so thin and fragile causes me to restrict my movements on wearing no magnetic tips for auto playpause if wear it to sleep it cant be turned off by simply removing and sticking it together like other neackbands u have to use or phone or the buttons to pause the musicconclusion i returned it and bought realme neackband though it was horrible boosted bass and mediocre sound quality simply because of better features but i still prefer the sony on music qualitygrip to the ear need to improvegoodthe product is well packed and tamper proof packed with sony hologram in the boxconsthis is compatible with new edge bluetooth version so might not work with old phones like in my case with sony r plus and xperia mworks with redmi proin my casethis is not exactly band but lr connected with thik wire which might fall if jumping or during workoutsound is lower to sony wired headphonesprosclear and balance sound with sony quality music hearing experiencebase feels sufficient and clear not like uncomfortablethe connecting wire instead of hard plastic band makes it light flexible and weightless to wear and packing in the luggagemic clearity is pure and your voice is very clear and sharp to the front personnot like othersits complete value for money as this is perfect in its quality which many brands in this price tag is not able to dothis can be folded and packed in conclusion go for it if you are riding and puting this inside ur collar not open else it will fly not suggested for gym as it will fallfunction are smart and easy to usesimply it gives you the best quality at this price and connectivity with mobile is strong toonot for magic expecters youtube insta the_voyager_adsound quality is goodbattery life is great with good sound qualityaudio quality of phone call is poor keep this in mind if you are using this product more for callingquality of the product and its sound is goodbut it always slips from the neckthere is nothing to hold it in placekeeps falling and i am afraid i might lose it
4,it is working as expected so farno complaintsgododthe product is definitely worth the price and keeps the laptop super cool i am not a gamer and this review is not for a gaming pc its very convenient for my office work the cooling pad has an additional usb and it helps in case an additional usb port is required when using the cooling padnot in mostly usegood productbut fan speed is little slowi tried it on my gaming and office laptopthere was difference in temperatures on gaming laptopoffice laptop hp core i th gen did feel slightly cool to touch with the cooling pad but its ergonomics arent greatbut its value for money the two fans offer very little airflow and audible noise in wintersbody is sturdy enough but the laptop slips from the top grilland when you use the non slip clips on the front they come in the way of your hands while working on the laptopyour hand essentially rests on those clips and it hurtsdesign needs improvement and fans should have higher airflow accordingly a customer wouldnt mind slightly higher priceit is a decent product and economic in this price rangefan speed is decent for better speed give power from your chargernot recommended for high end performance laptopsa good product that keeps that decreases the laptop heat my dell vostro with th gen i would hover at around c during regular use such as browsing movies youtube ps emulation etc but with this cooler the temps came down to c during heavy gaming tested with fallout new vegas cpu igpu the laptop heated up as if there was no cooling pad but the laptop surface felt cooler please note that i live in a hill station and the climate is generally cool so your experience may be different i have not tested this with a gaming laptop
4,good product saves your palm from the rough surfaces its ok so far the external material deteriorated a little but nothing like it has become unuable or something other than that all goodi am super satisfied with this mouse pad i have been using this for office work as well as gaming for the past few months and i have to say it provides extraordinary comfort definitely will recommend everyone to go for this as it exceeded my expectationggreat mouse pad month using after post reviewusing this product since months soft and really useful for daily use bought it for bucks i will recommend buying this productit is a wonderful product and gives the best experience and reasonable price build quality and smoothness is excellent it totally gives a premium inhand feelwould definitely recommend itabsolutely terrific purchase worth the price its very sturdy at the bottom so it doesnt move when you use the mouse and the the grip is also greati purchase this after my hand got scratched because of the table where i keep my hand when using the mouse now the problem is resolvedvalue of moneydifferent colour should be available
4,well i had a notion that cheap bt headphones could not produce good sound well i was wrong n im glad i use iem in ear wired headphones usually used sony skullcandy soundmagic kz m not gonna say its better then all of the above but u will be satisfied with the product sound quality is awesome bass is good not like in earbut still wonderful and enough u cant have the effect of an in ear earphones bass quality in a cheap bt for that u need to spend at least k i think it has a passive sound isolation nd its great due to its fit and the foam half of the outer noise gets substacted just by putting it on then the rest go out while the music is on dual mode is good but dont think anyone would use the normal mode cant use the phone eq on nt headphones thats a down side but u can use other third party eq or the eq in spotify or saavn works the headphones itself might feel it could break cos all of it is made of plastic but feels like its a good one and wont break the pads are soft it dosent hurt the head or the ear used it for hours been hearing from a lot of review about the sound quality of these but believe me most of them r giving the review after using it for the first time headphone guide u need to burn the drivers i mean u need to use the headphones for a couple of days to get its full potential and sound quality is very good vocals are easyly separated bass is enough treble is the right amount the way i like it sound stage is good due to being a on ear with big dynamic driver and u would feel the richness of the sound cos of the brand a better headphone is the one which creates good and detailed sound not those who are loud so yeah i would recommend this over boat and one last thing due to it being only a bt headphone and no aux cable is available the sound quality deepeneds on the device ur using the bluetooth quality and the amount of sound out put it can produce u can charge it with ur nrml charger if its v do not use fast charger been using it for two days now need to burn them drivers more and will update on the sound quality and yeah the battery back up is really good have used it for almost hours still charge left it shows in the bt connectivity sec on ur phone at the end if ur looking for a headphone with a good premium look a well reputed brand and great sound quality do buy this without a doubt this r satisfactory very much go for itp s amazon delivery is really not up to the mark even being a reputed company and all ow and another thing saw some complain about it being manufactured in china mine says manufactured in malaysia yes its a original one have registered it with harman audioeverything the bass the battery is superb just a big and only problem it doesnt support dual connectivity which is available in even boats below headphonesdual connectivity is very much required for many as we have to work together on smartphone laptop simultaneouslyso again again disconnecting from lapy the connecting to mobile is just painso harman please include dual connectivitybought this at kgood one but sound is low who wants to listen music veru loud with high bass its not for them also its not covering for me sometimes its giving pain while using long hoursgoodgood productgood qualityagar build quility ko chhor diya jay to to yah headphone tak k best headphone hok

4,quite affordable but got a few issuesjust got one usb connector that connects both mouse and keyboard what if someone wanted to use them separatelymouse sleeps after a long time and you have to press a key in keyboard inorder to make the mouse active againamazing i really really like it this keyboard or mouse using daily feel good and more interest at work to doi bought this for daily use for my devices but since has only one receptor so it can only be used with either kvm or single machine at oncealso the battery hole on the keyboard will only accomodate lr aa batteries only and is not even suitable for the normal aa batteries so you will have to have differnet kind of batteries for both the mouse and the keyboardalso there is always a lag in the typing of the keyboard its not as efficient like if i press keys pretty quickly one after the other so either it will pick only one key stroke or the second key stroke before the first oneyes this combo is pretty good if you are going to have a normal usage at home with just one pc in place then it is one of the most worth the money products but for all rest and regurous usage this will not satisfy the needs and you would need to go higher ranges of comboprosbuilt qualitydesignmouse design and accuracyconsseems small keyboard no num pad same as apple keyboard sizeif your budget under go for itsmooth key pressthere should be a switch buttondevice is very good suitable for travelersi like the size of the product and operationeasy to fit in the laptop bag evencarry for presentations outside to operate from a distance

3,its a good product in this price i would hardly get any worst thing about the product as far i am using this its totally fine battery life is good case is good looks is good and the sound is great this range this product is good if you are thinking about other companies than thats also fine first compare than buyyou will enjoy the music for sure its loud with decent bass but if you are picking this up for calls its ok when you are in silent sapce its definitely not a good option if you have to use them for calls during a ride or in a noisy public placesnot good for calliggood for musicyou get what you pay fordoes the job the button is very sensetive so even when you when to press them to go back right into your ears something or the other gets happens may be its too early for me to get use to it over all alright product for the price bluetooth connectivity goodtoo small need to be careful if ur moving aroundwell only time will answer if its worth the pricedoes not fit in earalways fallsrest is ok
4,wd only names enjoyed productgoodspeed is as it shows on packagegood oneshould be baughtproduct was good but delivery people behaviour was in rude and reckless manner they simply throwing the packages even though i object that way of doing they irrecklessly giving answers like we r throwing packages as it is tell to anybody whom you want please cancel the licences of of amazon delivery agencyhi i write this review after a long working period without any trouble in sdd compare with hdd this sdd have boot my laptop much faster than old hdd and rwr speed is good trust to buy with more capacity in feature thanks for the good producti was looking for nd hdd for backup ssd purpose its not highspeed io disk but getting all the advantages of ssd along with name of wdbest producti personally recommend using the product superb fastverry usefull for boosting speed of pc
4,impression of the pen were good handling grip is also ok can be recommended to buy for money excellent performanceit will stop writing in between eventually and has smooth area at first when writing after some time the grip will be comfortablereceived only pens pens are missing although pens r very gud it gives a smooth writing and a stylish look as wellproduct is nice and it works smoothly but i didnt get the refils otherwise it is very nicereasonably okaywhy only pensit said there are pens
4,nice combination for color sketchesit glides great but is sometimes notsmells bad when you open itcap grip not goodall good just the little messed upgel ink is good but the cap isnt tight enough keeps coming offi literally like the flow which is smooth like butter plus this also contain golden and silver shades
4,single touch on off is very bad every time use and single touch any surface this pen is off please updateworks great only issue is it turn off suddenly after mins of use also power on and off sensor is very sensitive but oher than this issue works as it shouldcharging is not so longerpretty decent for moneygood product at reasonable priceperfect fit for amazon basics pencil really awesome beyond my expectationsafter few days of usage works fine you can see youtube reviews for details one drawback is accidental touch on top tends to power off the device the charging c cable within the pack i got is defective doesnt plug in correctly charge holds for good time over a days usage kingone is cheaper in agif sale and this one was relatively expensive but at price point compared to apple this is good for casual use
4,this turned out to be the worst mouse ever double clicking within a month and scroll wheel scrolling in the reverse direction randomlyedit the warranty requires you to take the mouse to their service centre which was a pain as it took me a while to find the nearest service centre and the address was incorrect the service centre was helpful though as they replaced my mouse in a matter of minutes with no hassle will edit based on how the replacement worksedit replacement mouse working well so farthis mouse feels and looks awesome the slight rubbery texture feels premium and the build quality is also amazing but the clicks seems to be a little sensitive for regular use its amazing cant get better but for gaming i would want a mouse with a little sturdier click i click heavy during gaming and the mouse may take it but it remains in my head so even for light gaming its fine where use of click is less as compared to fps shooting gamesit is an awesome upgrade for beginner level gamers just changing mouse can actually improve your experience and gameplay my boyfriend recommended this to me as we play valorant together and my aim was persistently bad even though i tried so hard playing with regular bluetooth dell mouse changing from that to this piece was a great doing recommended if youre just starting to play anything like csgovalorant or any other first person shooter game on regular basisi purchased it ondec and i am writing this on dec and ill be honest no other mouse can offer this much quality in this price so if you can buy it just go ahead but but theres an alternative mouse by razer almost the same price razer deat ader i guess thats the name so you better check that one if rgb is not your priority yiu can choose that one byego for itdesign is easy to hold and there are extra buttons on right side which i find very useful its size is perfect for my hand just one bad thing is after using for some time its surface become smoother or upper layer gets removedgood mouse but has poor wire qualityits little big but the mouse is giving its best for gaming

3,it works great for my laptopthis is a good accessory to connect sata drives to computer via usb interfacethe advantage is that there is no need to stop computer attach drive to sata then restart format etcthis is faster to install without turning off the computerthe con is that the data transfer speed is less also this cannot be used to boot from so its just an accessory to transfer data to and from computer in easy way but one cannot boot into this like one can using usb driveit is very handy speed is awesome working flawlessly but the build quality is very delicate they should improve the build quality but the main job can be done without any problem and im getting upto mbps speedthe product is good for the usenot cheap but its ok price also usb so its fast and the quality of the material is not that bad its plastic but good plasticamazon sent a replacement as the first delivered cable stopped functioning in one hourthe product works it seems usb compliantbut it is very flimsy for a product that could be used multiple times and will need to be connected and detached from a inch hdd or ssdthe plastic housing for the sata port can be squished and it even bends and moves a littlethe cable is a foot long but is thin and needs to be thickeri have another usb to sata port adapter but it is pretty sturdyif you are going to keep the sata part connected always then this product could be ok but not recommended for professionals who rely on such a cable to connect multiple drives in a dayits working fine with old seagate hard diskokay product online price could be maximum strictly in my opinion

4,get it get it get itit is my second time getting this keeb as i had modified foamtape mod and sold my first one which i had brought from elitehubs i was going to get it again from them but they lost my account from their server t_t which i had a few cashbacks balance onpros hz polling rate confirmed and checked using usb viewer by microsoft best rgb leds ive seen on a keyboard under k these things are bright vibrant af great clicks especially for a linear switch decent enough build quality angled usb c port at the side life saver for me feels great for typing and gaming looks great cons there arent any cons if you get this keeb but just to be nitpicky i would say that the switch and keycap puller that comes with this board is better if not used as the quality of it a bit on the lower side and it has a tendency to damage switches while pulling them out the software is sweet and simple but some more features can be added thats it get it soon before the stock runs out must have mechanical keyboard for your typing and gaming needs the keys are hot swappable no drivers needed just plug and play must download the software if you want a specific rgb colour or transitions and macros excellent built quality swiftly delivered from origin shop in days price is justifiable for people using the uk layout keyboard press shiftend key for press key above return key to type use fnwasd keys for navigation cheers too small for my handsi recommend the keys little more spaced and big for easy clickingthanks for reading my reviewthis is my first mechanical keyboard and im so happy with this apart from the lights i like the sound the keys make the quick response and swift keys id recommend it for people who might want to switch to the mechanical keyboard also the grey and white colour is awesomethe quality of the keyboard is goodthe sound n keys r impressivethe main point is the rgb which is excellent with soo many rgb modes which is always controlled by the software and the brightness is the bestif u r looking for a red switches mechanical keyboard and you love rgb go for this one but its keyboard if u r a coader or needs arrows key ig you should choose something else but if non of problems u have just go for itusing it from last monthgreat value for moneygreat lightsthey provided extra switches also which was lifesaver for me i changed switches in kb cuz w key and backspace was brokedeasy to mod

4,short review really good product and sound quality is very nice good for living rooms about x ft or even bigger space i installed it and connected to tv using coaxial cable volume clarity bass everything is perfect overall value for money productlong review i have experience other company speakers like jbl and sony and had decided to buy those but this one is similar in sound quality treble is nice and crisp vocals sound nice even at higher volumes bass is amazing fills entire room with that boom sound watching movies and listening to music is much better now with these speakersused these for about days and overall experience is good sound bar not subwoofer size is big considering this is w but for me this is perfect size as it matches my tv length and looks good subwoofer small and compact unit bass is amazing gives that boom effect in action scenes and when listening to music remote minimal but functional remote has all the required features in single click connectivity does not have optical spdif but thats ok as coaxial option is available and mostly all tvs have coax connectivity only take a look below for bluetooth connectivity overall bluetooth works very well except when you connect certain devices with newer hardwarei have a smaller unit installed in another room and always used to watch movies on that speaker unit but after listening to this one i feel sound and bass of that other unit is just very low this one really sounds good and makes watching movies and listening to music a good experiencenote i think the unit uses bluetooth if you have devices with new bt drivers or hardware when you connect such newer devices treble and sound quality has minor issue not much but still you can hear it in some situations that treble and vocals are not clear this is not an issue when you use your mobile to connect using bluetooth i wanted crystal clear sound so i have connected using coaxial cable and sound quality is amazing over wired connectionsound quality is average not up to the mark the best but aux mode not workingit would be good it the sound system was more better bestnice prodectremote playback so best mujhe to acha laga tag zebronic

3,stopped working after a month of use dont waste your money on this producteverything is best but build quality is avglets get directly into the pros cons sry it will be a long review coz the review have to be useful for everyone who plans to buy thispros the price given to this price bracket its the best one i can suggest from the built quality to the audio quality its superior for the price i got for this price tagthen the comfort everybody complaining about the earpads i dont know why if your going for over the ear type u have to be known that u cant wear it all day long the most expensive products also tend to warm your ears and get a little uncomfortable so if its not preffered u can go for earphones or earbuds as i bought multiple ober the ear headphones there will be rought cloth like texture that will irritate your ears but this one has soft cushion like material im really comfortable with this oneand next the audio quality i have previosuly owned boult inear earphones so i know the bass quality and vocal quality so i booked this without even thinking twice and it has delivered what it can the best part is im really comfortable in this one than my inear earphones the sound is even better and you dont get high volume levels like those local cheap products on the markets but the bass and clarity will give you some extra feel especially the bass its really engaging if ur a bass lover go for itthen the quality i know the boult for sometime but for over the ear headphones at this price point i was little skeptical about the build quality before the delivery and it suprised me dont think that build quality is extraordinary like sennheiser or sony coz ur not paying that much for this so for this price its so good even better than the boat headphones which is slightly high in the price tagnow cons little skeptical about the warranty because when i gone to register this and both while i was registered my boult inear earphones they didnt asked for invoice slips and no serial number is asked then how can they proceed if we call for the warranty claims but hopefully i think this will last long as seeing the quality next is the cable quality i didnt complaining about it but they mentioned in amazon as its an kevlar cable so i expected a lott but its a normal cable bt its sturdy enough i didnt check the mic on it i make a call on this the other person was able to understand me but i dont know hows the qualityto help you guys i have metioned every aspect in detailed manner so it can helpful for people who spend their valuable money coz every single rupee countshave a nice and safe shopping byeachhi product hegot the product delivered unharmed in daysi got it for this is the best branded product in this price rangesound quality is pretty good considering the pricebass is good but the loudness is a bit low you have to listen them above the level of your mobileclearity is very goodi bought them for online lectures and they worked great for the purposeear cups are comfortable and reduces much background noise besides they arent known for passive noise cancellationthe wire attached to the ear cups is a bit delicate and may break if pulled forcefully so you have to handle it carefullyi have attached a pic with side by side comparison of my old boat rockerz which i bought for in and they lasted for a very long duration of yearsthe boult audio q looks a bit delicate as compared to boat rockerz but dont forget theres a double price difference between themlets see how long it goessumming up this is the best product in this price segment just go for it if you get the samenoise level is so high i couldnt listen more than minutes so i like to choose another brand please refund for this productquality not as expected leveli use this product for mostly in gaming and listening songs but there are no mic in it
4,it is good and fragile simply affixed on screen there was a little difficulty faces as guide frame supplied is not according to glass but some how i fixed it successfully and thanks to seller for supply a pair of screen guard packaging was also goodits really of good quality i have read problems like the apple pencil doesnt work after applying this protector but i honestly didnt feel any lag i rated because one of the protectors created a bubble at a specific area and didnt get out even after trying so hard and following all the instructions properly and i had to use another one which got applied properly without creating any bubblesi ended up wasting one tempered glass because of air bubbles that wouldnt go away i skipped wiping with micro fibre cloth which may have led to the problem however the other glass worked fine i had to take off my ipad cover to enable the application the previous one wouldnt align with the cover in place adhesion of the first one gave up as soon as i tried to lift and reapply again might be attributable to the fact that i didnt get rid of the dust particles like i should havethe one that i successfully applied works just finegood product decent alignmentgreat product theres no such anti glare thing also not really good for using apple pencil i mean the surface is not paper like thats why one more thing it gets fingerprints really fastapplication is very easy but take care there is no dust on the ipad because if a bubbles formed you cannot correct itgood
4,can buy but only when price is lessits not tht oomph feel to writeconsidering the name parker its like regular ball pensrather can tell the ink is too dull compared to other ball penslot of money taken under the name parkerits the worth of i thought parker would be good compared to the lousy pen its uncomfortable i dont use it at allmoneywise goodi use parker pen because it runs finethe pen has a black body but blue jotter refill in it the blue jotter writes awfully the ink flow has reduced over timeim using this from last years im happy with the productnice packaging quality look

4,i had an lg monitor and broke it twice while wiping with cloth it couldnt even take my ring figure pressure first time i repaired it with huge cost but second time had to throw it then i bought this one slightly smaller as i was afraid not to pay too much lg had inbuilt speaker but this one does not there is no speakermike the picture quality is good i have a dell soundbar for audiomic so that is covered the brightness is too much at but i can reduce it to which is good enough for methe monitor includes power chord and hdmi cable it has a nice sturdy stand the build quality is good the viewing angles are also good with no glare from room lighting overall the picture quality is quite good the monitor also has eye care settings there are couple of separate screws provided in a plastic cover so be careful while unpacking i had no missing screws problemi have been using for my personal and office work its a good product when you like to splitting the screen and work simultaneously in two different windowsthe experience is far greatcame with the just the oem package slapped with invoice but the product was safepros inch screen pixels are small enough u can see it if u try but not bad ips bleed is not there but there is definitely ips glow but not that bad hz but meh i cant tell the difference but again i have hz phone so makes no sense to buy it for hzcolors are good movies and games pop out well comes with a hdmi cable which is neat build it good and angle of the monitor can be movedconshas like a slight yellow tint just like the redmi phone but u could get used to it hz is a gimmick no display port which so bad ips glow is there not much but dark things will look greygame mode is useless and eye blindingthe power cable has a adapter with it which is pretty fragile if it break ur monitor is a brick verdicti would say dont buy this just for the hz its not worth it i would be looking into benq and lg monitor or go big and get a higher refresh rate monitor i wouldnt say this was a waste of money but this definitely expensive for wat its offeringpros good display quality thats the end of proscons why on gods green earth there is no audio jackwhat is the use of hdmi port if user cant get video and audio both if someone is investing k on a monitor why in anyone will need a vga port build quality is questionable entire build is made of plastic which is fine but for me monitor was always a little tilted no matter how hard i screwed the stand it was still the same amd freesync isnt much affective you can still see screen tearing stand movement is very stiff i almost felt like i broke it just bad build qualityif you are only going to use hdmi port and find a workaround for audio then alright but for someone who games on pc and console both this is not good enoughif you are willing to sacrifice little bit of visual quality and hz of refresh rate which is not noticeable at all then go for benq same price but less hassleorbetter bump up your budget go for lg mkm which goes for k or less but worth itit could have one more hdmi port monitor for editing and casual gaming
4,good oneyou can go for itits a really good product in every kind but i think size is quite loose but if this is the actual size comes for laptop then im happy to have itproscolorsoft material of cushionsgood quality of zipconsmaterial doesnt seem like water resistant onefit is little loose i use hp envy and this laptop sleeve keeps some space in both dimensions you can keep the charger if its small enough but you shouldnt as it attracts scratches on laptop see photos for more idea on fit i found that laptop sleeve fits more to my preferencetry both oncegood productquality of fabric is goodif you are like me and are looking for a waterproof sleeve to protect your laptop from the rain well this is not for youit may be that the lining protects from splashes but in a scenario where you get caught in the rain water definitely makes its way inside the case and drenches the laptop i believe the zip is the weak entry pointother than that it provides ample cushioning and feels fine but yeah not waterprooflittle bit improvement need
4,torn packingdekhne me product used lg rha thai bought this color pen set for the first time and absolutely loved it what i like the most is how easy is to keep because of the connector the color options are neatly wide and i like it i would say though its not very smooth of you use it for color filling it does get smudge if you double coat it so there you have to be careful and also you cant order just one it has to be two set minimum to be delivered thats the drawback otherwise its good overalleays to use for kids above yearssimply goodthe connectors provided help to keep all the pens together these are fine tipped pens and hence can be used for mandala designs just remember not to overlap and colour as this may leave a smudgecolour pay off is goodin this price great productits good for beginnersthe best part about these are that they can connect so they are easy to carry themgood buy for the price during discount not used it yet as its for my niece

4,the product doesnt feel premium i would say its a good product given the priceable to hold all your individual wires and hard disk etcbecomes too tight if mobile charger and charging bank are placedi keep my small gadgets and cables organized inside my bag could be better if it had more space for at least small boxes adapters etcgood product has quite a few compartments and can keep a lot of stuff has readjustable brackets in one the sections where items of varrying sizes can be stored has enough pockets to carry multiple pen drives and chargers inner padding is slightly foamy so it does provide decent drop protection if you are tight on budget go for itit does what it is meant for all your wires chargers are in one place you can go for it not that luxurious but at this price its definitely worth having it than loosing your wiresgoodquality of marerial
4,some keys could be better but in this budget its good enoughi use to play gta and fifa and some car racing games which are so goodand vibration is so good in this budgetgood for this budgetthe product worked fine for months but after that the start button and select button of the controller went inside and it became defective and it stopped working so i had to wait for weeks for the buttons to come back up and for it to work again since those two buttons are not crucial for playing the game it was manageable to some extenttbh its good if you are a amateur gamer its completely fine at this pricebut if you are hardcore gamer pro level then i will suggest you to pay a bit more and go for a better one because sometimes out of no reason some movements doesnt work when i play cricket suddenly in the middle of the match one shot selection doesnt work and it disrupts the momentum still its a decent product cant say about durability now will update few months laterless weight compared to other sticksthe l and r is little hard but still playablebattery backup is goodthe charging port is b thats not a good thing because we all are using c port chargersalthough for this price point its okayi have been using this for weeks now and i saw no flaws with this one the l and r are a bit tight but other than that no issues i ruff use a lot when playing and this is very durable although it does not have markings for grip the grip is good too this one needed no extra installations and is a plug and play just what i neededdoesnt support all the time on windows the device is not recognisable most of tge times and you just need to plug and unplug the thing continuously
4,realme buds wireless design and specificationstruly wireless earphones are becoming very popular and we could very well see realme get into that space in the coming months however for now the company has taken on wireless headphones in an affordable form neckbandstyle earphones the headset has a flexible neckband with metal modules at the ends short cables that lead to the earbuds and the plastic earbuds themselves we quite liked the yellowandblack colour scheme of our review unit the design is simple and the build quality is decent the device is light at just g and comfortable to wear and use for long hours at a stretchlike earlier realme earphones the realme buds wireless have magnets in each earbud while they dont serve any purpose on the wired models beyond keeping the two earbuds together the magnetic clamp serves as the power switch for the realme buds wireless separating the buds turns the headset on while attaching them powers it down there is no power button so this is the only way to control power on the headsetin theory this sounds good but the weak magnets meant that the earphones separated easily when placed in a bag or pocket this would turn the earphones on and automatically connect with our paired smartphone even when we didnt want it to which was bothersome calls would be automatically diverted away from the smartphones earpiece without us knowing the battery would run down and the phone wouldnt automatically connect to other devices such as a bluetooth car audio systemwhat you do get in the sales package are three pairs of silicone ear tips ear wings that are preattached to the earbuds and a microusb cable for charging the charging port is on the underside of the right module which also has the controls for playback calls and volumethe realme buds wireless earphones are powered by mm drivers with bluetooth and support for the sbc and aac codecs the earphones have a claimed battery life of hours on a single charge and are said to offer minutes of listening time on a minute charge when the battery is drained we were able to get around hours of use in our testing while a full charge of the headset took a little under hours to complete realme buds wireless performancethe realme buds wireless bring a refreshing change to the budget segment offering a great combination of design and sound quality for the price also fans of electronic music will be happy to know that the realme buds wireless have been tuned with inputs from popular dj alan walker and the sound does come across as geared for this genre the wireless earphones with use aac bluetooth codecs we listened to streamed music from spotify and youtube music as well as our collection of highresolution tracksstarting with take five by the dave brubeck quartet we immediately noticed that the soundstage was considerably wider and more detailed than what were typically used to hearing from products in this price range some of the percussion instruments sounded crisp and well defined although the deeper elements in the middle of the track the doublebass in particular was a bit soft and not quite as distinct as wed have liked still we found the sound to be detailed and rich on the wholenext we listened to a bit of indian pop with an unplugged rendition of amar arshis kala chasma apart from some gentle aggression in the low end we also quite liked the inoffensive nature of the mids and highs as demonstrated with the familiar vocals of the track the sound of the realme buds wireless is tuned for comfort and nearuniversal appeal and sticks to that brief we heard just about as much detail and clarity as we could have hoped for from a pair of wireless earphones that cost less than rs the realme buds wireless as a handsfree headset for voice calls and results were mixed in some cases we found that voices on the other end of the call were soft and our callers reported too much background noise a crow cawing about feet away sounded as if it was coming from right next to us for the person on the other end on other occasions no issues were reported so call quality seems to be largely dependent on your surroundings and possibly the strength of your cellular signal verdictmore expensive pairs of earphones such as the oneplus bullets wireless and more stylish dual dynamic driver might offer much more by way of sound quality but the realme buds wireless does a capable job for just rs this is a product worth considering simply because it is everything you need for the pricethis headset is built well has decent battery life and is very comfortable to wear the only significant problem for us was the magnetic power switch which often led to the earphones automatically powering on at awkward times that aside the realme buds wireless is a pair of earphones that does exactly what its supposed to no more and no less with unwavering consistency and we like it for thatpros looks good light and comfortable detailed rich sound for the pricecons magnetic power switch is troublesome inconsistent performance on voice callsratings out of design comfort audio quality battery life value for money overall go and purchasedfirst of all if you are a electronicdance and hiphop genre kind of enthusiast than your search for a good quality earphone still continues its not like these earphones are worthless for these genres and cannot be listened on these surely you can listen and enjoy it but you just could not get the vibes you get while listening those on deep base earphonesfrom my music listening experience from years i can tell you that the depth and that vibrating surround base effect is not in this it surely has some thumpy bass which is required for perfect balance in every genre but due to lack of that deep base you will definitely regret your purchase if youre a hiphop edm lover the mid tones of music are a little low in this earphone which also ruins a little the experience of these genres song listening experiencethis wanna makes me think everytime is alan walker really tuned thisfor trap hard dance genre its good but not the besti can tell you such differences because i am also using a wired earphone namely mi earphones pro rs which is excellent and produces very great sound for every genre and definitely have that deep base effectrather than for those genres song these earphones are really good for every other genres if youre fine with the above listed drawbacks then only head towards the detailed reviewupsides the material quality is good its plastic but feels like a soft silicon layer is applied over its top layer both on the neckband as well as the wires of the earplugs these are extremely lightweight and doesnt feels a like extra load on your neck at all noise cancellation is really very good im really impressed mic quality is also the best that can be offered in range no complaints the earplugs fit is good but i advice you to remove those removable angular paddings for more snug fit and comfort is fine but could be more better as my wired ones are really more comfortable and if you have also experienced something more comfortable than this then you can also complain about its comfort for long use the blutooth range is really good still works if rooms are in between the magnetic onoff control is like cherry on cake and works like charmwhen you seperate them it takes seconds to connect with your phone if already paired before and if phones bt is on and if you attach them together they go to standby mode and goes off if not opened again within minutes its really good that youre getting this magneticfunction in this price sound can go really loud but i prefer to use it on micro usb cable pair of extra eartips small large are provided in box medium is preapplied and is perfect nearly for everyone battery backup is good expect hours of continuos playback on volume charging speed is also good you can easily get hour of playback on o minutes of charge and can fully charge it around minutes if fully empty did not get to experience its splash retention propertydownsides the outer cover of earphones are of plastic good quality but they would have given aluminium frame in this price the wires should also be given as braided one for rough and long use no realme branding permanent anywhere on the earphone confuses us but theres tag attached on the neckband the cap on the charging port should have given to prevent dust from entering small carry case or pouch should have been given to make it travel friendly when connected to the device when there is an incoming call it doesnt recites the number of caller and it sometimes doesnt notifies at all but no major con is theresound quality the vocals are really amazing now i definitely understand the lyrics of pop songs the lows and highs of the songs are really great but mids are little supressed and you would definitely miss that in edm and hiphop songs as that evary low details are not required in dance songs the mids highs are more important the base is adequate and keeps the song alive but not produces that well deep and surround base that youngsters love but it definitely has that amount of base required in any song to feel it im also a younster and im fine with it as ive bought it as a secondary earphone for watching movies and series on tv

4,i liked everything like product quality packaging was so premiumone thing i didnt liked is you can get fingerprint easilystandard cover for the price need a little common sense to apply could use help of your local shops decent product could be little cheaper spen works after applyinggood product though bit costlynot smudge proof at all but apart from that itsthe glass fits perfectly around the screen it is completely transparent and has no black edges cutout for the front cam is perfect as wellvery easy to installthe screen guard is of good quality but it sometimes creates problems in writing with the s pen not an issue but just for the information overall good and value for moneythe seller is basically lying by saying anti scratch and smudge proof as it is clearly notpros durable not cracks during year of usecons heavy smudge that you have to wipe constantly and scratches appear with regular use

3,mouse open cover was little less qualityexcellent keyboard keys are big and comfortable keyboard is super silent keyboard is compacter tahn a full size keyboard only con is the mouse which is super small even for my average size palm otherwise the mouse is smooth only after you twitch the mouse settings in windows settings and only on smooth surfaces on a computer mat it would be a little jumpy and rough only wish the mouse was a bit largeri love this product very nice one works very wellthe combo of mouse and keyboard is off really good quality the key travel is really great on these although it would have been great if the mouse had been a bit power efficient as the keyboard as it eats up the single aaa battery quite fast also wouldve liked a power switch on keyboardsome times blutooth connection problem occursfirst of all as in this price range its pretty good but the comfort while pressing keys is not goodif we press one key automatically itbis touching another key without any intentionu can buy it for k but above u can go logitech productseasy to connect good looking value for money easy to type and clickgood

4,good product under it has pots for mic headphone and usb for led glow you will require a splitter for laptopgreat product for online tutors as i also purchased for the same try this product if looking for budget headphone for cpu for gaming and online classesvery decent headphones the mic is also very good durability needs time to tell the last redgear lasted about yearsits so comfortable to weari have even tried the cosmic byte gs from the same price range though i find these pair to be more value for moneycomfort they are comfortable the earcups are very soft and recommended if you do gaming for longer periods of timedesign the design is actually pretty good considering the price rangemic the microphones quality is actually great considering the priceconnectivity recommended if your pclaptop has a seperate mic and sound jack you have to buy a splitter if you want to use the mic on a mobile what ive noticed with other headsets is they provide a single jack for sound and mic output but these come with jacks so thats a plus pointsound quality these pair of headphones are only recommended for casual gaming and media consumption the sound quality while gaming is fine although it doesnt have that sound but still i was able to figure out the footsteps i also use the windows sonic for headphones and that helps toohowever at this price dont expect a good sound quality if you listen to music the max volume feels low and the bass is almost non existent the treble highs and lows are done fine but buy these pair only if your priority is gaming and you are at a budgetsee the headphones are good if u are purchasing in to but let me tell u dont have good surround sound mic volume is too low you cant increase it and no bassthe headset is overall good its sound quality and build quality is appreciated at the same time i have a few concerns first of all it gives a lot of pressure on both ears so after an hour it starts hurting my laptop has one input for audio this has two so you have to buy an extra pin to connect it otherwise go for itthis headphone is to good in low price noise cancellation is working properly also u can adjust volume as your choice im using this headphone for my live stream problem if your head is big it will fit properly otherwise movingthis product is decent base is low but it is good in the given price range
4,original rd jan this is my first smartwatch i have bought a couple of honor fitness bands earlier for family but this is my personal first i have been keenly following the smartwatch space for the last months or so and im aware of most of the products in the budget range while i can afford a slightly more expensive one gtsgtr or honor gt pro oppo watch fitbit etc with calling feature i wanted to get the feel of a smartwatch in the budget range first i gave a lot of thought and finally bought this one as it included gps and amazon alexa yet to be included but must be available through an ota update id have loved to buy amazfit bip u pro as it has almost the same features with an lcd display has gps and alexa in the global version named amazfit pop pro it still isnt released in indiacoming to the watchs performance the typical features i tried today first day are heart rate hr spo stress monitoring and gps i have a pulse oximeter from dr trust at home and so i could compare the hr and spo the numbers on the watch arent very accurate to my surprise heart rate variation by bpm and spo percentage off by points at times but i still feel its more to do with calibration and the way these numbers are measured than inaccuracy of the hardware etc gps was a breeze as i walked on the terrace of my rural town house it wont surprise me if i dont get the same performance in a metro city with a lot of high rise apartments etc the compass worked fine when i compared it with my phone music controls worked fine bluetooth data transfer or sync was good i couldnt control the phone camera as i couldnt get that feature to work refer to image and help me if you can i didnt face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notifications the readability on the watch screen has been really good tried a couple of workouts while the step count seems to be fine not sure of the accuracy of the stats on other workout modesto conclude i wouldnt say that this watch is a disappointment but it needs improvements on the accuracy of the fitness stats probably i should give it more time but fitness brands have done better in terms of accuracy at least the honor bands ive seen eagerly waiting for alexa update as im curious what all it can doi would love to update my review after using the watch for few more days lets seeupdate th jan the battery is a clear disappointment as many other users pointed out im hardly getting it for days with always on display and an occasional workout limited watch faces both on device and the app not many out of these do justice to the good display waterproof nature of the device is good i didnt dip it in water but it got wet when i was bathing my kids and it seems to have a waterproof coating which was in action i got the camera shutter to work i hope amazfit provides updates to fix battery drain and enable alexa notifications didnt have an issue but could not clear individual items clear all workedreview of amazfit gts mini smart watch modelhello everyone since the new model of amazfit gts mini arrived i am going to review the old model of itprosdisplay inch amoled display really good look prosbattery coming with mah from percent to percent it takes days to drain and it was expected to last day longer normal use but if you are a light user it can last it for days proip rating ip water resistant which is cool proheartbeat sensor it has heartbeat sensor and it is real but it may not show real accuracy at all the time but it performs good procomfortness it is really comfortable wearing this watch and the band is silicone material prowork out modes there are nearly workout modes and i tested out some since it is built in gps it works nearly accurate but the measure is not that much accurate but it works well procan track stresshas pai feature to progress your workout with better experiencealexa assistant but need phone connection to activate this has other modes like breathing menstrual cycle trackingtodolist inbuilt alarm pomodoro timer sleep tracker timer in built compass camera remote find the phone controlling music etcnotification system you can get notifications call control system you can accept or reject calls but you cannot able to talk through watchconsbuild quality it is told that this watch is completly aluminium frame but it is quite disappointing that only half frame is gun metal aluminium and half is poly carbonate con watch faces the inbuilt watch faces are quite depressing at initial impressions but there are some watch faces that are really good conspo i dont know how much accurate it is but coming to technical part the sensors are failing most of the times sometimes cannot able to sync workout history converdict it is not a bad idea to spend money for this watch due to immense features and real sensors but you should compromise on sensors efficiency and build quality the incoming call notification disconnects if youre away from the watch even though other notifications are displayed in the watch i have accidentally hit the display of the watch while walking in walls and steel doors even though its not damaged water resistance is good i used to wash dishes wearing it no use of alexai think its a good buy after months of usageall over amazfit gts mini new version is good but price is high and also calling features not available that is the biggest drawback apart for this other things are really nicesleep tracking is fantastic but there is some bug after the update is that the sleep traking track itself even we not wear the watchrather all thing are fantastic and battery life is day in normal uses
4,product is good and betternot badvalue for moneyits not water resistant but its its quality is good for the price tag it very good buy made of good quality clothe materials zip chain compartments including laptop one planty of space from inside waterproof material used stitching is good although to be keep on mind is that even it is made for inch laptop this wont fit with some old generation laptops or any gaming laptops coz they are thick so only officenormal laptop from current generation will fit easily as they are slimthe product is good quality as it can easily carry my laptop with charger and headphone i was looking for such bag since long and the blue color is really appealing the cloth material i liked because it is water repellent so need not worry about little rain as well the smaller pocket can easily hold wallet mouse or any small goodies overall i liked this product thanks tabelitoproduct quality is good easy to carry inches laptop with charger bag having two small pocket where you can carry small things fabric is awesome and blue color looks more attractivesuperb stitching and finishing it has a trolly bag support trap as well great for every day office bag and also for days business trip of all within rs i got this loot deal if you found this deal inthis price just go for it quality isnt compromised for this price at all i must say will update my review if any quality issues i will face but for now i am very much happy with my bag

4,i really liked this router for a smallish space the coverage never dropped and was mostly consistenthowever it suddenly developed some snag and stopped connecting to the internet apparently the ethernet port got damaged somehow i tried calling tp link service center numbers and realised how bad their service is its the first time in my life that a router has broken and that too after just over a years usage and to make it worse theres dismal after sales servicei tried to buy a replacement from tp link but that router came with problems as the connection wasnt stable i think ill finally look towards other router makers and avoid tplink product until maybe they start caring more for their costumers hopefully ill find a good maker good routerafter researching lot i settled on tp link ai was looking for better range router this router really worth the price dual band guest wifi i upgraded from tenda n and performance is really goodrange for gz is not that good as gz but which is accepted and no other routers in this range can provide better than thisi was using tenda ac router since for mbps connection from local isp mach broadband mumbai most of devices mobiles laptops firestick at my home work on ghz except cctv camera range of tenda ac was good and used digisol ac repeater for farthest room of my bhk homein recent lightning strike in mumbai power adapter of tenda ac got burned out and performance issues creeped in with replacement adapter i was searching for router with good range and speed within my budget i tried routers mercusys ac mrg tp archer c ac before this both routers didnt meet my expectation range and speed of these routers were poor than my earlier tenda ac amazon accepted returns without a single question thumbs up to amazonafter some more research i zeroed on tp link archer a c as per comparison on tp link website both are identical routers after doing some more research on blogs and reviews i found that archer a is the latest model and had slightly better processor both from qualcomm hence purchased archer a feature of onemesh is added advantage for adding onemesh repeaters in future separate wifi ssid with same strength on both ghz as unnamed wifi can be seen on wifi analyser as per tp link support page this is dedicated wifi link for onemesh repeatersnow for router router is same as tenda ac for coverage it can not cover farthest room in bhk on ghz ghz band can cover bhk house but speed is around mbps on mbps plan however speed on archer a is better that tenda ac im getting mbps upload and download consistently on devices feet apart in ghz tp link archer a is better than costlier ac routers just for info i received us version v of router instead of eu version mentioned on tp link india website hence firmware on tp link india website will not match with device firmware however this device has auto update option directly from internet also router can be managed by tplink tether app remotely on internet even tough not connected on same wifi by login using tp link account on both router and tether appby trying so many routers i understood that ghz range will be week even with costliest router instead of using digisol ac repeater i installed my old tenda ac in repeater mode for ghz ghz disabled now my complete home is covered by ghz signal in the farthest room i receive download upload speed of around mbpsi also tried old tp link archer c which i had purchased when abroad performance is not good in terms of speed and range as it lacks gigabit ports beamforming mumimomy isp has connected my link on gigabit port of their switch in my society however cabling is only pair cat e which supports max mbps full duplex i will try to get cabling changed to either pair cat e or cat from isp and check the performance i will update review after cabling changeso in the nutshell i would recommend to go for router with gigabit ports beamforming mumimo even if your internet speed is less than mbps as it is future proof tp lnk archer a is good router meeting all requirement within the budgethope this review is useful in search of good futureproof routeredit my isp tried to replace my connection to ftth and this router was connected to fiber onu using gigabit port it worked only for mins max speed was mbps isp was not able to resolve the ftth issue and changed cable to pair cate which supports gigabit transmission now net speed is around mbps my internet plan is mbps im happy with the speed i have asked isp to change my connection to ftth at last tenda ac is now working as wired repeater connected on gigabit port of archer a using cate cable now complete home received stable wifi of mbps on ghz bandi will update once again when ftth connection is successfulgood product till now monthi am very satisfiedi am really satisfied with this product as earlier my phone is keep getting wifi disconnected and i used to reconnect it and the same way vpn is keep getting reconnecting in my laptop hence my teams call used to disconnect during the meeting now i am happy with this product where my vpn is not reconnecting even internet goes down and if any flatuations in the network as well finally i am not seeing any issue with this router it is helping me during work from home please go aheadits easy to use easy to install more function to control the router
3,wifi ability to connect with the printer is not very goodi did my first print and ink gone quickly as water evaporates under sun lolim doing an exchangegood products and very good print qualitythe printer came loosely put into the hp printer box without any of the usual styrofoam packing it was rattling in the box before being openedafter a couple of days of very light use probably no more than pages both printer cartridges ran low and the black already ran out i had to replace itwhen i was installing the printer i had noticed that the cartridges did not have the protective tape over them didnt think much of it thenit feels like this was a printer that was being used somewhere and they put it into a new box when shipping or someone opened a new box inserted used cartridges and took out the new onesthe scanner also does not seem to workthe printing is fine and works i think the problem is with the company that sold and shipped it to me somethings amiss hereits nice but take time to installation which cause trouble at once after that its easy to usebest one for home needgot delivered today and i set up using the cable and fired few prints print quality is good need to see how long the catridge lastsbut for home purpose and medium usage i think it worksthere is some serious issue with the product it is not working now need service engineer to repair it
4,watch is awesome satisfiedworking properlygoodpackaging was very badgoodgood routergoodniesone of the cheapest wifi gigabit routers those not willing to pay k rupees or more for wifi e routers will find this one to be suitable enough keep in mind that wifi e routers will of course have better performance and stability than wifi routerscan easily stream k videos and download files no issues on video calls either on phone or pc no connection drops or any other problems so fari had to input my ispprovided account username and password during setup on the miwifi website not sure if that will be the case for everybodywill update in a few more months
4,overall it is a good product but it is not worth rs the price should have been lowerits good but not bad superb quality product before buying this i used springbased holders and my samsung and nokia phones bent due to high pressure so buy this product blindly writing it after month of daily usagei like the colour was fantastic it was easy to input in mobilevery good adapter to have specially if you are a mobile vlogger very stable and feels solid once attached to a tripod the rubber grips to hold the mobile in the clamp makes it sturdy and non shakeable mobile remains fixed in its place the material used is solid tooworth the price does the job and is adjuststable as shown in the description glad i got these at such a reasonable priceawesomei bought it for my iphone works fine for my phone
3,i bought this splitter for rupees i did not find any issue with this product i am using my wired realme buds earphone and msi gf laptop to test it my feedbacksmy mic is working properlyno issue with left and right soundbuild quality is also not bad splitter used flat cable which seems durablerecommended good product overall i needed this type of adapter for connecting my mobile headset to my pc for listening recording so its working well on my pc but only problem is if the earphone jack is inserted fully to the line out socket of pc front side the sound is very low so it needs to be inserted only in that way full maximum sound coming working with boya m mikewhen i decided to buy this i found this with good reviews and amazon recommended after using it for many months there is no disturbance in the quality both mic and soundsince i use laptop and desktop with same earphone i need to frequently connect and remove the earphone from the cable the cable is connected to desktop to connect the earphone directly in laptop having done this so many times there is no issue when it comes to qualityi have recommended this to my colleagues and they also have liked the performanceyou can buy this without hesitationthe headphone jack works well but when i put the mic jack in the pc it creates a lot of noise which i am easily able to hear it causes a bit of irritation sometimes elsewise the product is quite goodgreat product and really durablegood product
4,grand productgood quality but not the bestbest used for backup or archive drivesive been using this since july and it has been quite a helpful one i can also put my internal drives and make it external making it easy for me to access my files format my drive or use it for some other purposes and orico products are really sturdy and well finished productsits worth buying the product very easy to connect the hdd in the case just slide the cover and insert the disk plug the cable and you are readyspeed is also very goodthe case is quite good in connectivity and transfer speed but the case body is made up of low quality plasticit is advisable to go for adata casei have been using this for couple of days and i am finally writing a review for this item it works perfectly fine i connected my years old laptop hdd through it and i am getting about to mbps mega bytes readwrite speed previously i purchased a sata cable which promised usb but that did not give me more than kbps so this time i made my choice and got this thingit works fine and easy to install my doubt is with the sturdiness will use for few months and updatesuper light and really sturdy
4,its really good product for gamers i would recommend itgood mouse overall price is little highi have been using this mouse since and i have to say logitech built quality is second to nonei have throwed and bashed this mouse on my table during my gaming sessions yet this mouse still surviveseven the rubberised grips are still there go for it without any hesitationfor those having button issues i have so far replaced my left click and middle click button i started developing these issues after years its a simple soldering job to fix it you can get replacement switches from tanotis now they work as good as newso ive been using this mouse for quite a long time and believe this is the best mouse so far ive ever used but the problem is with the cable as another customer said the cable quality is not good the outer portion of cable from usb and from mouse side coming out and the inside wires can be visible even though mouse runs good but this is not good for long term usage other than this is pretty good mouse we haveat close to g it is ridiculously heavy for fastpaced gaming for chill rpg titles itll do fine but if you wanna play something like apex legends on this forget it the shape of the mouse is super comfortable only mouse ive owned that didnt give me any wrist pain even after hours continuous usage cable quality is what you expect like its not even braided since its an older generation mouse it doesnt have the doubleclicking issue logitech is infamous forafter all that i would say in just dont buy it its too old to justify spending any money onyou know and love logitech this is one of their best productsid say this is hands down my favorite budgetgaming mouse its nice and comfy works properly and also has multiple buttons to assign them to various actions which is not just limited to games you can assign them to windows actions as wellhave been using this for the last years and i have absolutely no complaints although my brother thinks that it looks like a beetle
4,a good battery set for use with cordless phones quick charging long lifenice product no issue so far a bit costly compared to other brandsnice but bit costly compared to other productsquality is good indicator is very helpfulgood chargerbought the bqccn version of this it charges my duracell batteries just fine only downside is that it takes a while for full charge hours for mah aaa duracell batteries the green led indicator is a little confusing because it does not change colors and the way to know it has finished charging is if the leds turn off overall pretty happy with itusing wireless mouse so instead of purchasing batteries again and again this is working quite wellincredible charger it charges battery very rapidly and battery charging percentage also showing very efficiently
4,so i got this keybaord a few days ago and it came in a package that can be best described as being mauled by a bear it was totally beaten up and inside the batteries of the keyboard ha come loose alsothough i could just pop it back in no problem thankfully it works fine i tested all the keys and they are functional so lets get to the meat of the subject or paneer if youre vegetariani think this keyboards performance will vary according to your use case for me the primary objective was to get an android compatable keybaord since i had shifted the majority of my wokrload from my laptop to my tablet i checked the internet and settled on this little guy becaue of teh glowing reviews and from my friend who had the ink variant of the keyboard i bought it along with the logitech pebble m wireless mouse since it came in a bundle and honestly i dont regret it both of them fir very well into my work type and theyve made my life a lot more easierthis is of course a bluetooth keyboard and it does not have any wireless dongles hidden away in the chassei checked the keyboard has no backlighting as expected from a wireless eyboard that runs on regular pen torch batteries and from my friends experience this battery will last you a long time the major feature of this wireless keyboard over the other brands in teh market is the ability to switch between bluetooth capable devices with the press of a button now i personally thought that i wouldnt be using this feature all that much since i was plaaning on using this keyboard for my android tablet but then i realised that i could set up my laptop as a second device and switch between my tablet and laptop without any issues making it easier to type out papers on my laptop and responding to texts emails on my android tablet at the same time nowadays i cant stop using this feature since i have my phone tablet and laptop paired to this keybaord and my productivity has become much more efficent it is honestly very neatthe keys are rounded which is much more pleasant to type on than lets say square keys and the slight inclination of the keyboard serves as good angle that reduces finger fatigue while typing this comes with no wrist rest so people who have had hand injuries should either look for another keyboard or buy the wrist rest seperately teh keys are membrane keys and they feel a bit stiff in my honest opinion but nonetheless it has a good feedback and the typing experience is very comfortable it does not have a number pad as you migth have seen from the product images so if you are someone that crunches a lot of numbers ine excel you might want to skip this keyboardthe latency is quite low from my perspective i dont think they have that crispy logitech lightspeed tech built into it though but you wont be using this for gaming and if you are planning to then please dont this keyboard performs horribly in gaming and i mean its terrible this is a keybaord targeted at people who do a lot of typing across multiple devices and it is built with portability in mind if i am ambitious enough i can probably stuff this keyboard into my pocket because of how small it is like my friends say i have small hands well this keyboard was probably designed for a rat because my hands are huge compared to this keybaord sometimes while i am resting my hand on the homerow my ring finger accidentally presses one of teh mushy media buttons at the top and everything i am doing goes into stasis but that is more of a me problem than a problem with this keyboard it does come with arrow keys which is very surprising they actually managed to squeeze it ini mean thats pretty much it for this keybaord dont buy it for rsk i suggest waiting for a discount because this thing is certainly not worth that much i would say this is like a rsk keyboard but thats just my opinion if you are buying this for the android experience then i suggets buying it bunded with the mouse because both of them kind of complete each other with that being said im going to conclude my reviewmouse came turned on apart from that no issues discovered till now it going goodits one of the best budget keyboards i have ever used the membrane keys are very soft and easy to click not lift off weight easy on the fingers its been around yr since i bought this keyboard and iam using it ever since no issues so far and iam highly satisfied with my purchase definitely gonna recommend it very good typing experience so far caps lock indicatorheight isnt adjustableno backlightthe key travel is very very less please keep that in mind otherwise a decent product at the price rangei bought this in combination with a logitech pebble m bluetooth mouse for the sole purpose of using it with my ipad it has made my tasks easier and with recent ipados updates there are tons of shortcuts that make ipad experience more productive since i was going for a retrolooking device i chose sand color makes me nostalgic about the old school computer devices that had similar finish connectivity is fast you just switch it on and its connected to your primary device in a matter of seconds even less they keys are not silent but at the same time not loud enough to disturb your environmentyou can connect upto devices and switch between them seamlessly with the push of a button im also using the setup for gaming will maybe update later about that experiencefinal comments ergonomic economic portable and lovely recommend buy for all who need to get work done fastthis keyboard is awesome it has a flawless connectivity and a great size for portability just that it is not fitted with a lift at the back and i miss the backlight design but it is a value for money product works flawlessly with mac as well as windows
3,the printer is compact and gets the job done no concerns regarding the time taken or the print quality the only markdown for this product is the setup the user manual is brief and doesnt explain how to setup the printer wirelessly or by usb we spent a good hour having to look through the online manual and you tube videos to understand how this was configured and through trial and error we managed to get it all readyeasy to installgood print and enough for home usage but installation is quite tediousbudget product installation was a headache did not know if it was done or not but wireless printing is working somehow gets the job donethe printer is good for personal use its working fine till now its easy to use print quality is also good scanning is easy and its image is fine canon product quality is good to sayshipment received in time on th sept due to lack of time i could test the product recently it is working fine wi fi set up could not perform successfully i shall try again shortly other function are working satisfactory only worried is that the cost of its ink cartridgesprinting photos ar totally not clearpros the best only wifi all in one printer in the range of k with ink saver so called low usage required low maintenance thought of buying ink tank but learnt from friends that its suitable for heavy printing and when they didnt use it for a while repairs needed hence decided to go for inkjet with low cost maintenance this doesnt require daily print like ink tanks product is solid built and no issues observed so far many long term reviews also confirmed flawless working for years so decided this model print quality black is very good but colour is average does the job for kids school project purpose easy setup its very easy to setup if you are techy setting up wifi took little bit of time an hour i hate reading manuals and it was first time with a printer at home wifi printing via mobile is a breeze with canon selphy app easy photo editor by canon is also quite useful handycons black is good but colour is pretty average like i said good enough for home students purpose not happy with cartidges supplied by canon they seem to fill only half or less for demo purpose it gave around pages for black and pages of color with lowest quality settings where in they claim black and color both cartidges were almost empty and mobile app started showing the same ink cartidges cost yield the cost cartridges seems to be increasing when i was purchasing this it was around for black but now its around and i had no faith on the yield based on what i have got with stock cartidges its not worth buying cartidges so go for refill we only find cl s which is small where is cl large size couldnt find anywhere online

4,the scan code is too small for configuration sometimes two way communication has few echo sound which becomes little irritating as the title suggests its a good product but could have been better as it is competing with several brands which are known in the market for their other productsin night camera wont work u nned to on extra light for it only work in day time conditionsvalue for moneyposting this review after using a week it is worth buyinginitially faced difficulties in setting the camera and connection establishmentcable length is about feetas it mentioned its rotate perfectlymotion detection is also perfectnight vision picture quality is averagepicture quality is good when area is fully illuminated with lights else overall picture quality is good smart tracking works goodyou can share this device up to total personstwo way communication is not so goodmobile application is also good but use of pan and tilt option is taking time to take in effectsome times camera missed recording of motion and human detectionit works only on ghz networkethernet port is given for wired networkto operate this camera you must have strong ghz networkit does not work well on mobile data network as it laps frequently and taking time to load live and recordingif you dont have internet than still camera records recording stored in sd cardonce you connect the internet you can explore recordings from sd card but you can not downloadfor download in mobile you have to subscribe imou protect plan which is expensivewithout internet it is uselessi think all above points covered to take decision for go with imou ranger overall works as expectednicegood product in pricemast

4,first i would like to comment on the tab market of india the most peculiar thing i have seen in india is when a particular product is aimed towards students or education suddenly corporations go out of their way to milk money and under deliver as much as possible it is exactly opposite to how students are given access to technology in the usa you watch the prices of chromebooks tablets back to school offers in the us and compare them to india and it feels extremely unbalanced after the pandemic there was a huge surge in the tab market and tier brands started delivering garbage for rupees snapdragon old mediatek gb ram abysmal non ips screen for k just to mint money and take advantage of pandemic scenario and the circumstances of students this tablet brings the revolutioni am no student but bought this for day to day use and i am an user of the normal big bezel th gen ipad so my review will be comparative in nature also i bought this at rupees so my judgements will be in accordance to the price i paid if you are planning to buy an ipad just buy it considering gb is enough for you and you use it for normie scenarios you do day to day stuff you will be satisfied with your ipad with its everlasting updatesthis tablet if compared spec vs spec give a good challenge to the ipad for k rupees even for k it is fine build is fine although i put a tempered glass on the st day itself back is plastic but sides are metal and the back gets quite smudgy the ips screen is really good there is no backlight bleeding no dead pixels as you can see in the picture with the dark background i am used to oled screens on phones so at first blacks may disappoint but oled is impossible at this price the screen is better than my th gen ipads display it is brighter has more punchy colours blacks are darker on top of that hz panel hdr certification dolby vision support makes it great for content consumption it would be a great device for xbox cloud gaming with the xbox controller attached to it display is the part of the device with which you interact the most and display is the highest point of this tablet snapdragon is fine in a market where older mediateks and lower midrange snapdragons are dumped into the market hence i say if you dont want this just buy an ipad but dont buy any other android tablet at k price point all are trash was fine with all those games which rule the market today it has less pixels to push than in a phone and the bigger surface area helps in better heat dissipation so gaming is effortless i cant comment on how the battery will serve me in the long run but for now i dont see any drain or backup issues with content consumption or gaming it has a watt charger in the box although it does support watt charging the bigger battery takes some time to charge with the inbox charger but my ipad takes even longer with its trash charger and it has a bigger battery and apple devices are extremely picky with chargers the camera is okayish just like most tablet cameras the ipad has even worse cameras for document scanning it should be fine but other than that it is not much useful it is still better than what samsung and lenovo gives in k range tablets the second highest point of this tablet is its quad speakers they are loud have depth are not sibilant and have brilliant stereo separation and soundstage they are louder and punchier than those normal non ultrabook thiccc laptops which cost k they will hit you as a massive surprise i did not at all expect such good speakers they seriously outmatch those cheapo rs boat goat mivi generic speakers in terms of distortion at max volumes separation and low end of course those cheap speakers would be louder and more shrill but it is about quality vs quantitycoming to the cons was it courage or something else that xiaomi couldnt find a place for a mm jack not even a dongle in the box they should seriously stop copying apples wrong habits and instead copy their good habits like long device support via updates although i mitigated the issue by using portable dongle dacs like shanling ua ibasso dcetc which i generally use with even my phones and my pc coz they are way better than on board audio of most devices except some devices like some lg phones with quad dac i am an audio enthusiast so i spend money on such products and you need not although it works with my old mi a dongle just fine for rupees i dont expect the pen and people who are expecting a pen with k tablet should really open their eyes and look the disaster also know as indian tablet market and its offerings but for k they could just offer a bundle where you pay kk rupees more and get the pen as an add on the accessory market might not be that vibrant already there are no unofficial cases available from good brands there is one from nillkin here on amazon and the seller has the audacity to price it at rupees lol the official xiaomi folio case is magnetic slap on at the back and i dont trust those type of casesone more issue that i would like to point out is that xiaomi lately has a tendency to creep up prices by rupees within a month or two by doing the good old gst bro so if it ever reaches k for the gb version just close your eyes and buy an ipad with card discountsso in a nut shell for k it is was no brainer but even for k it is a really good deal considering what its competitors arehope this was helpfuli have been using the mi pad for over a month now and am only glad that i didnt spend more on an ipad once the retailtherapy phase of the device wears off what remains is the user experience while it is true for both devices i find that im more at ease with the mi pad for the sheer look and feel of the content i watch in it i also spend a lot of time reading books and illustrated designs pdfs and i often found myself amazed almost chuffed over how good the content looked that display gets the accolades for a reasonthe mi pad largely meets my expectations and when people see this tablet the immediate comparison they make is how much it resembles the ipad a gross generalisation so heres my take on apples ipad th gen vs xiaomi pad if you have an apple device already and are especially looking to expand on the productivity element from the tablet you need to stick to the ipad not just because it is going to regulate the standard but you will definitely miss out on the features that ecosystem offersso buy the ipad if youare not concerned about the pricetagare looking at designing with the apple pencil and are familiar with or going to use procreateare making an investment with this purchase and will not be back in the market for a new tablet anytime soonintend to use the tablet for presentations and want to take no chances with the devicehave a clear purpose for the sidecar feature if you dont use it despite buying the ipad you are missing outengage in a lot of official videoconferences and are prone to moving about and may accidentally go out of frame the ipad has a feature that addresses this to an extentare not expecting substantially higher results than the mi pad from the inbuilt camera in generalhave a proclivity towards the apple design their decisions and are generally happy with the software choices apple makes for youdont really care about features beyond a rigid list of activities you are certain the ipad is able to do and that this list is unlikely to change in the near futurelooking for a reliable product that will receive software support for a long period of timeare expecting the device to be used by responsible adults who are careful with the tabletare unaffected by hefty repair costs should the glass crack or the rear panel be dentedhave a need to use touch idon the other hand buy the mi pad if youare looking at gaming on a plethora of titles that are on the google playstore and perhaps not found elsewheredont care much about the stock ios cookiecutter experience and think customization is the only way youll truly be happy with the tablet you usewant the best quality of video and photo capture from a tablet meaning better video calls and video capture this doesnt mean the camera will replace the phone you already have but the pad is a tool that goes the extramile of taking good quality images scanning documents and allows edits on its large screenvalue videoquality from the mi pad camera than the ai that drives the facetracking function ipad offerswant the most of the audio experience higher audio quality clarity and richnessare expecting rich colour depth hdr quality video experience and will be spending more than of your time on the tablet watching videosdont like limitations imposed on you as with the software you use sideload apks rooting custom firmware overclocking etc if you do any or all of these forget about the ipadare mostly going to use it as a fun device to watch movies on or consume audiovisual mediaare not expecting to pay an arm and a leg comparatively to fix a broken screen or a damaged back panelare okay without a fingerprint scanner and is okay with faceid pin or pattern for securityat the end of the day you as a user of the tablet spend most of your time looking at the glorious screen of the tablet and interacting with what inside the device not the logo at the backthe tablet is totally fine but sometimes is bucked out there is so many bugs bugs glitches i have contact to xiaomi they will try to fix it one req dont upgraded after you buy dont have to do after the update not a single google application is running on floating window and while split screen there is so many black patches around the bar white bar sometimes nice tablet you can go with it and if you are thinking about productivity multimedia go for it because most mostly as student do presentation word excel taken notes and all the things and handle easily were by this tablet and i am using it for games and other purposes it handle it quite nicely but you have to wait for android l because android l is good for tabletnew update is hereso the new android update is here unfortunately is not android l but is working fine all the bugs has been fixed few miner bugs are there but its totally refined from the past and system is working great hertzs now looks amazing because animation bugs has been fixed and battery life is been fixed is now working more than hours fortunately video playback and for day to day task you can go easily to days because i am doing ppt excel sheet and other documentation its work totally fine and yeah thats the new update and go for xiaomi back about pencilso i bought xiaomi pencil for and if i say latency has been improved but if if you dont have the budget of go for another shopping site which name after f cart yeah and you can buy its fsmart buy pencil for rupees it works fine too and you dont have to spend you can go with the just you will not have those key features like taking screenshots and write something on it or double tap to note downover all i am satisfied with this tablet
4,for those looking for a genuine review a brief comparison summary between the best three earphonesheadphones in the budget segment lets help you to makeup your mind the review is for sennheiser s earphone but items for comparison are sennheiser hd ii over the ear headphone sennheiser cx s in earphone sony mdrxbap in ear extra bass earphones just for an introduction i would like to mention i am a dire fan for flagship electronic goods manages to fulfill my passion for the taste of quality from time to time now lets begin when you start looking for earphones or headphones sennheiser is definitely a brand worth to look for and rightly so the brand has acquired a great reputation of producing some top notch quality gears in its segment i too started my quest to purchase some of the best sounding earphones within reasonable limits of purchasing power excluding those insanely pricey onesread some very good reviews of the sennheiser hd ii professional overear headphone from my fellow amazonians and bought itfound it to be reasonably good but having certain drawbacks may refer my review of hd at amazon which were not upto my tastenext unsettled i went to purchase these sennheiiser cx s in earphones and here are my observationsdesign construction a looks feels delicate to hold with its extremely thin wires and if you are casual in handling frequently then in the long runits sure to failb wires which are around m in expanse are not tangle free and keep getting into random knots each time you get to use itc comes with different sized earpieces to snug fit different earanatomies and provides decent sound isolation but not the bestd inconvincing design of the earpiece globes as the bottom tail piece below the earpiece was not large enough to grip with fingers to comfortably fit or adjust the earpieces in the ears and each time you had to twist the spherical globes to snug fite comes with a gold plated lshaped additional adapter for better fitment to laptops etcf comes with a small pouch which for the most part was a useless accessory for me a case or box would have been more a more elegant option squeezing the whole earphone into the lill pouch everytimenaah feels primitive but then its my own two piecessound quality performancexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxthe sound quality is crisp clear with clear mids and crisp pitches bass was okayish but leaves you craving for more every time you plug itin to watch some movie or natgeo documentariesthe lack of an adequate bass may even get unsettling sometimesthe frequency response as per specs was to hz against to hz of sony mdrxbapjust to quote sonys bass could get really deep low with its mm drivers and neodymium magnets for purists senneheiser does its job quite honestly but in general as for sony a little makeup wont hurt lolsound quality is maintained till the maximum volume though it felt slightly that the mids succumbed to pitches at the apexverdict xxxxxxxxxxxxxx lack of a decent bass extremely fragile design is unacceptable at a price range of bucks for me not worth itdetails comparison xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxi happened to test the quality performance of all the renowned sennheiser hd ii over the ear headphone sennheiser cx s in earphone lastly sony mdrxbap in ear extra bass earphonesbass xxxxxxxxxxxxxxsonysennhd senncx s the extra bass at sony may feel out of place at rare instances but never feels cheap redundant or unpleasant to the ears its a quality refined timbre bass not some low quality stuff hd bass was ok but then it had other issues with sound leaking from the pads and disturbing otherssound quality xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxexcellent on all but sony a bit appealing with its phenomenal immersive bassbuild design xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx again sonysennhd senncx s sonys wire were tangle free earphone pieces felt indestructible noise isolation was ultimatenext was sennhd and least by any standards was senncx sthe fragile design of the wires around mic in senncx may itself be a let alone discarding feature for many sennhd ii might be good for gamers and watching from a distance with its long cord if leaking sound to outside world is not an issuebass is anytime better than senncx s but not as mesmerising as sonysound quality though is very goodcrisp and clear senncx s might be good for purists but even with its balanced highs and midsserious lack of bass keeps you longing for more especially if you are more into moviesgames and documentaries than musicmoreover its extremely fragile always tangling thin wires is a constant annoying feature sony mdr xbap gets the most evident and refined high quality deep bass with crisp high and quality midsits indestructible unique design offers the best noise isolation of all and comes with the most sturdy tangle free wiresdo not consider higher bass as an adulteration to pure musicits a quality bass with frequency response as low as to hzadds a mesmerizing essence to the quality of sound which is absent on other twoprobably like a super amoled with extra vivid colors that look more punchy full of lifeanyways at the end of the day its your callkeep listeningnote there are thousands of reviews for this product but surprisingly theres hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market i am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime i also happen to use jbl csi and sennhesiers cx so i would be comparing all these earphones in this review you get a l shaped connector in these earphones so note thati am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the best earphone in that subtopicbuilt quality boat flat cables which is tangle free in true sense metal housing holds up good but colour sheds off after months perfect l shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting jbl small round cables shredding off after months of moderate usage plastic housing doing great so farconnector is bent but not in perfect l shape so its quite pain to use while resting sennheiser small round cables holding up good after year of rough use plastic housing has become slick as rubber coating on it has shredded off perfect l shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting winner boat comfort boat comfortable enough when used while in upright position these are very uncomfortable when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so has very long earphone head jbl comfortable enough in upright position slightly uncomfortable using while resting as these have offset opening sennheisers comfortable in both the position these are apt for long duration usage winner sennheisers cx loudness cx boat jbl cssi boat tends to distort above level of volume jbl crystal clear even at full volume but has least sound level in all of three sennheisers tends to distort above level of volume but has greater sound level of all winner sennheisers cx sound quality bass mids lows i noticed that all of them have almost same mids lows which are strong crisp but bass levels are different boat has average bass i am very disappointed with it since these earphones are marketed as bassheads jbl has least bass of all i felt treble is high in these sennheisers ton of bass and when used proper eartips its just a treat for bass lovers winner sennheisers cx sound quality over call boat i noticed in early few months quality over call was great but started to deplete after months but its still good not as good as new noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side jbl its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now sennheisers their no microphone lol pnote boat jbl boths mics works with android and ios perfectly winner boat customer care boat year warranty had no issues till date so didnt got chance to check it but some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences jbl year warranty had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within weeks after contacting nearest service center sennheisers years warranty i had of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service centernote i first contacted the company via mail with my product details and i was given all the required details for service i would suggest this to all winner sennheiser cx connectivity all the earphones have mm connector and works perfectly with both android and ios devicesverdict i dont think i need to explain anything else now since i mentioned all the points of all these earphones to sum up i would say boat are good if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies if you want mic and even want to watch movies resting then go for jbl cssi but if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me then certainly go for sennheisers cxhope this review helps you make sound decision
4,quality is good but rubber is missing in one of the leg of the alptop standgood product strong and sturdy price can be little less around i bought it with that in mindthat thought was fulfilledheight adjustable is not equal and perfectits very useful and value for moneyaffordable adjustable stand for laptops it is really light and doesnt occupy much space easy to carry stand is stable in flat surfaces simple to fold and unfold good to buy this productfabulous producta good one must buy value for money
4,it worked well for some days later it is not working i want it to replacenicesuperb product with white lights at both ends when charging colour and quality feels very premium build quality nice product highly recommendedgood quality and looks beautiful i will surely recommend after using it for weeks i use samsung m few months back my usb cable was torn so i wasnt able to fast charge it took a decade to charge from samsung original cable was too pricey and too flimsy so i was searching for something durable while browsing through the product page i was skeptical to place an order as the company claimed too many features in such a low price keeping the negative thoughts aside i ordered it anyhow the product was delivered well in advance which made me happyi unboxed and plugged in the cable to my surprise the cable delivered everything that the company claimed the ends have aluminum casing which makes it durable and away from regular wear and tear it has led indicator on both ends which turns on when the charger is plugged to the phone also the box that it comes with has a secret code that you need to scratch to reveal which helps to check its authenticityit easily fast charges my phone in an hour overall im very happy with the producti highly recommend this cable to anyone who needs a fast charging type c to c cablewill update this review if any change is observed
4,it was what i expected does the jobrecommendednice quality and durableit is exact same volt and watt as my old charger isbest product in this price and overall ok originalquality assurancedecent performance
4,value for moneygood the mobiletab stand is a well made product tilt and height adjustment are a great pluses sturdy enough for tabs can be used on a flat surface like table top not top of my bedhave been using this for almost months now no issues faced till date i have bought both black and white ones but white variants quality is better than the black onenot durable durability is requiredordered this since i liked the simplicity of this productwas little disappointed when i received this because of the following reasons had scratches on it probably someone returned this earlier and it was fixed and sent to me the screws are little loose hence reduced a star when closed can see gap so is not so perfectin the end decided to accept the flaws and keep it rather than getting it replaced didnt want to go through the process since the flaws are not so badno screwto hold top part stableutility product for mobile tab etc
4,i have lot of cables running between my soundsystem settop box tv and between my routers accesspoint it was kind of messy before i organized it using insulated thin metal tie cable but when i open it to add more cables or remove cable it was broken and not looks good also i was afraid that tightening the tie cable may cur the wire since it was so thin and insulation is also very thin but after i use this it looks so neat and it is easy to remove or add more cable whenever required adhesion of wellgrow is goodoverall i like this producti suggest dont to precisely cut the wellgrow add some of extra length which will allow to add more cables in future if neededall was good but i received pieces instead of since i have used already im not going to return it just requesting the sellers to deliver as promised other than that the product is great and works greatnot only wfh setup but also if youre dealing with a lot of wires this is the way to gogood qualitygood quantity and quality sticks tightly and easy to strap helpful for keeping wires organized at work table laptop charger mobile charges etci had to bind together variable number of wires at different places and this worked great without any wastageuseful to organize wire little expensive but i dont have time to find it in my locality and quality is also goodthese are strong and better than plastic tags which you normally use to keep wires in order these can be removed and reused they are also very strong as they are supporting my bluetooth soundbar which i have hung up in my room

4,bahut aacha hai ye pen sach me likhne ke baad erase ho jata hai so nice i had bought of these and they are excellent pens for the price but even after waiting for the ink to dry so i can erase the ink properly it still left a stain and also after keeping my notebook at room temperature it started show the ink in a light blue colour which was not very noticeable hence i am giving this product stars also i like collecting a lot of stationery from japanese manufacturers and this was not as good as i expected so i would rather buy a uniball air or a signo or a sarasa not expecting so much compromise from a brand like pilot whose vsign is placed at the same price and definitely did not have any quality compromise whatsoever anyway if you want a starter pen take the v or somethingmy current goto pen highly recommend if youre someone who happens to do a lot of scribbling while writing an exam paper really great for annotating stuff which you can erase and correct as and when neededthe pen really erases but the ink finshed just in a week½ so not to use this pen if you are a student like meyou need to apply more force and move your hand fast to erase what you wroteits a very nice pen writes very smooth comparable to a pentel energel gel pen grip is comfy it has a nice click sound when retracted the eraser part gets dirty with oils n dirt sometimes which when erasing with leaves a faint brown stain due to the oil n dirt just wipe it with some cloth like your shirt and youll be fine wish refills were easily accessible thoughbest for neat homework if your kid makes lot of spelling mistakes slightly expensive occasionally found dry inkeasy to use write only on paper not elsewhere value for money

4,keyboard is good i dont really like that clicking sound of mechanical keyboard as i am a software developer and write codes most of the time some times that mechanical sound really irritiates and sometimes seems stressing out my fingers this keyboard is good works as i wanted it to be but the real issue is while i am digging my code with mouse keyboard light goes off and i need to click caps or num key to lit it again its not an issue for average user but irritates me as i sometime forget to turn on num lock and while typing number in my code i accidentally change edit mode to insert due to pressed otherwise all seems ok i wish hp had offered always on option for this keyboardif there is any wrist support this product will skyrocket in its price rangea good product for this price range rgb light is elegant and good quality keys and its builtsmooth keystrokesuneven distribution of the backlight over the font causing hard to read keys only time when all keys are properly readable is when you look at it directly at a perpendicular angle since i dont need to look at the letters for normal everyday typing i can get away with itthere are no indication in the keyboard for the fn function key combos usually in other keyboard there are symbols in the function keys to indicate what they do when pressed with fnoverall it seems to be acceptablegood and value for moneythe silver coating came off after daysdoes the purpose of backlit and typing for typing not that great buy keyboards that are less mechanical for that this is good buy doesnt give the ease of typing style as in a laptop
4,its quality is really good and it can carry to laptops easily no problem to take must be taken the quality is great the stitching is also strongthe stitching is very ordinary and it looks bad on the inner sidedecent purchasethe product does not have zip and preferred to use black sidethe red side gets fluffymeasures are to inchyour laptop should be smaller then this sizeso that it fits and easy to removefit perfectly for laptop material is good not best but within this price it is really good bit expensive could have been under rupees justified works well prevents from dust undoubtedly one should go for itproduct looks goodbig size want small size

4,no complaints till now only cons is st time connection is lil messy once it connected no need to look backvalue for money bought it for around on sale quick easy to install good coveragebought this as wifi was not working in my room due to placement of router was very doubtful to buy as it was pricey as per my view but once you buy you can take it with you when you move or shift so its a forever product strength of wifi is so good now i can watch lectures just install app you can also add or remove people who uses it very manageablei bought this as a backup extender setting it up was a breeze but i faced a silly selfinflicted issue i entered wrong wifi password during setup but setup completed as if the connection to the router was successful when i tried to browse it showed no internet connection between the extender and the router it took me some time to troubleshoot and correct the password ideally the setup process should have highlighted the error and stopped the setup process showing the connection to the router was not successful it would have saved me some headache to troubleshootextender coveragei use the extender to reach a corner of the house about ft away from the router where i get sporadic and weak signal mbps i locate the extender about ft away from the router to extend the network and now i get a connection of mbps it is enough for my workspeed test results at the time of testing my laptop recorded a speed of mbps next to the router at the point where i located the extender ft away when directly connected to the router the laptop recorded a speed of mbps at the same point when connected to the extender the laptop recorded a speed of mbps only drop not so bad feet away from the extender without direct line of sight the laptop recorded mbpsoverall i am satisfied with its performance for home use but its range is like till one room only it can extend not much but good one like my router is in middle passage in my home but its range doesnt come out much without extender when i started using extender it pulls the range till this specific room if your room is one after the other then it wont go till last room extends my wifi signals and does it job very effectively once concern is i have g actfiber signal but this gives hz only but still managable for tv laptop mobiles etc for home purpose
4,the led light is vibrant with multiple form selection buildup is too good feels strong and wont get damaged even if it was to fall from table height the battery life is too good if used without leds with leds it will last around to hours only without led more than hours for sure dont expect too much bass and overal sound quality is good for what one is paying justifies he price initially i was using jbl go version but surely i can say jbl was way too better with bass than this one but obviously jbl wa double the price go for it if u want a desent sound quality with fancy led lights overall starps the size is actually larger that what it feels in the picturesits good for home purpose kids to entertain music and light effect but not for party or something like thatsuch a best product at this price but little disappointed as in photos and description they said memory card slot is there but when i get this product memory card slot was not there but still i like this product and specially lighting effect and good bass soundsound is no doubt goodbluetooth range is short battery life is not up to the markled light is too goodi would have rated it star but sudden night it really made a chaos it was uncontrollable not switching off made horrific noise out of the blue i kept it outside whole night so that the battery drained out and next day it was functional i think that was a software glitch anyway it didnt appear again for sakegood but battery drain pretty fastvolume is lessnice products

4,at the sub inr price range i was doubtful to buy a mechanical keyboard as there are a lot of disappointing pseudo mechanical keyboards available at this range i already had a logitech g prodigy which was great with its membrane so i almost thought of not buying it but after much thought i bought it it turns out to be amazing it has a key cap remover included which is a great bonus each click feels responsive and great i am typing wpm with this compared to my g the size is a bit small for a full sized keyboard and the rgb is somewhat painful but other than that it is the best keyboard in this price rangegood keyboard for people who loves typing sound nice product very good build quality price of rs is justified and i have written the review using the same key boardbest budget friendlya very good keyboard to begin your mechanical keyboard journey with this is much better than any membrane keyboard you will ever usebeen using for more than year and still working fine although the blue switches slowly lose their crisp sound but that is expected from this brand of switchesvalue for money i wish i could coustomise to colour of rgb but rest its very goodvery good product and perfectly working wellhello guys today i am going to tell you about hp gk gaming keyboard so it cost me around and i give the ratings from star i will give it three star because it have some rgb issues and i recommend you only buy this keyboard if you get it under if it cost over i recommend that dont buy this keyboard
4,writes smoothlynicethe look and feel of the pen is amazing being a parker its extremely smooth but the lid of the pen case is broken so it would be embarassing if you are gifting it to someone and they find it brokennicevery nice pen but not ball pen jel penits the best parker pen i have every used and it have came my mainparker pen i have to pens of parker but this is my main pen now dont think twice just go with it its the best pen pls buy if get a chance very good amazon
4,first of all delivery of amazon it was as specified no delays hence appreciate itpackaging not good the box was tempered torn and damagedproduct ordered black received brown didnt replace as the color didnt much mattered issue is with the seller thoughperformance the pen of good robust feels cheap however looking at the price not to complain writes smoothfor anyone who wants to enter into fountain pens can start with this as it does the jobedited have been using this pen for over days now i am facing issue of nib dryness if i dont use the pen for sometime the pen doesnt write at all i have to wet the nib or do something or the other in order to make it start writing it writes great when it starts writing but the initial pick up is really bad i have a platinum preppy too its a better option to go with if the budget is tight however there we have good writing but bad looksfew points i have been reading about this pen which i would like to answer compared with two other pens parker vector and luxor v grip read in couple of reviews regarding the thick grip and the curve at the grip which makes it awkward to hold honestly have not felt so at all the grip is pretty medium larger than parker vector and comparable to the luxor v it wont create any problems holding it i am an average and people of same build hand and finger size wont be any problem also on parker vector the metal body starts to feel slippery due to metal small grip and feels tiresome after writing couple of pages been nice to hold the elegante and feel firm in hand it makes one feel like holding a pen with substance nib and feeder it says fine on the nib and it is comparable to the luxor v and parker fine nib few claim it is medium kinds its all about the pressure on puts when writing it i just touch the nib on paper and rest the pen does so would say it is fine it is way too smoooooother and fluent than parker which felt a bit rough parker fine nibs give a feedback making it bit of a dragging experience however on elegante the nib just flows and slides over the paper it is not only the nib but also the feeder which ensures the nib slides the feeder ensures that there is even flow of ink through out the writing experience the writing it leaves is slightly wet and not dry personally i prefer that over the dry and dragging this ensures that one gets to write about pages ie sides without a refill plastic construction and feel in hand the cap is made of brassas they say the cap has a matte finish not a glossy one the clip and top is glossy gives a fair enough good contrast to add some looks to it when taking it out of the pocket d the pen itself very much plastic if i try to weigh both the cap and pen separately roughly they feel of same weight it is that light weight just a feel factor how i felt however this does not mean it is a cheap construction it has fallen from floors down and did not crack anywhere so would say its good strong plastic it makes one feel pretty solid holding it the size if compared to other two is larger it rests pretty well in between my thumb and index fingerwhich parker does not luxor does hence never needed to put the clip on the rear without the clip it is very much balanced parker and luxor both feel well balanced without the cap placed on top with clip elegante and parker feel a bit top heavy ink filling personally always been a fan of eyedroppersgood old school days however this comes with the standard piston filling as seen in the photo by hari when i immersed the nib in the pen and pulled the piston it just filled half had to dip the whole nib till the grip when it got filled in parker just dipping the top nib was sufficient for luxor pulling the whole top part out and then refuel it seemed very tedious some other reviews i read people have tried removing the piston converter and used it as eyedropper few said it worked few said it leaked need to substantiate it not sure and hence wont try this out to spoil such a nice piece if anyone has tried would love to hear your experience writing after weeks for luxor it works immediately even after months it worked like magic for parker bit of dipping or couple of splashing out and it starts for elegante it did not start immediately from school days used to have an airmail unfortunately misplaced it when i shifted it used to work like a beauty even after weeks elegante on this aspect did not fair so well however how many of us are not going to use their pen for weeks always something to write sign or pen down it worked fairly after a break of one week colour personally the looks of a pen hardly matter to me its the balance in hand and the nib which are the real heart and soul we pay crazy on high class pens just for the looks for few people this matters more individual choice and nothing against it parker gives a good classy look luxor makes one feel more of a student than a person with authority or executive elegante would be a mix of both and middle of both neither a college going look nor an executive look on looks it does fair enough justice the cap and two metal rings is all that makes it stand apart would have loved if they would have made more colours than maroon black and blue nonetheless these colours are the royal colours and pretty good than what reynolds have bright designs which are more for school going kids to attract them this does enough for me spare nibs and feeder not sure if there are spare nibs available online i am at a location which is s of km away from any civilization in a jungle or a desert and only way is to order online thankfully speed post delivers faster than couriers lticaptd after using this nib i would personally not place any other nib i am pretty happy about it always good habit to have spare nibs dont know when one drops it and needs to change recommended for its a must for student at this price range where one is still studying and not earning this sounds a good buy though not the best as luxor beats this is vfm parker would never recommend it for students if someone wants to carry it for exams carry atleast all due to the limited piston converter capacity luxor would be best if you are an executive sitting in a board of meetings where you want to make a statement by what you carry then there are many other alternatives this is fair on looks and pleasure for writing value for money for a standard person like me or a student luxor beats elegante and parker however for a fountain pen this is an excellent vfm well this sums up my experience after using it anyone has anything more to add to this or share their side we all would love to hear it first of all it came in a really bad condition the package was almost flattened all thanks to the people connected with the transition and delivery thank god it doesnt have any dent secondly it is probably a used product because it came with the smell of ink in it out of the box thirdly the brand claims that it is having a fine nib but probably according to the european standards i am a pilot lover so i know what fine nib is this is medium sized nib at its best according to the standards of pilot using a pen with fine nib is like having a perfect orgasm you remember the experience for a long time the handwriting also becomes better thats lacking in this pen thankfully it doesnt squirt ink every now and then like most of the other cheap fountain pens i had two wingsungs those were unbearably squirty fourthly the grip is average fifthly if you are a beginner you may go for it as it will obviously let you get used to the fountain pens you may use it as a day to day penbut dont stick with this one only explore the world of pilot if you have the budget trust me you wont look back to a pen like this i was gifted a pilot crocodile fine nib by my mom i want to keep my memories with this pen safe so i dont usually use that thats why ive bought this one lastly and most importantly a suggestion to the buyers to make your pen experience ergonomic please dont put the cap on the backside open the cap keep it aside and unleash your writingvery nice pen its really amazing very smooth writingthank you seller amazonits not for speedy writing if you are use for signature its cutting off character some time spread over ink and some time character cutting cheap plastic product but at a good for beginnersive been using this pen for about monthsprosbuild quality for this price is amazinggold nib looks amazingconsnib comes out easilyjust that the neck area of the pen was little broad for me to get used to guys i have started using fountain pens again a few months back i had used all types of fountain pens during my school days like college brand eye droppers camlin parker made in usa hero china made recently i am using platinum preppy which is very smooth and excellent pen and yes expected since it is japan made this the camlin elegante is our very own made in india pen it makes us proud just superb pen very smooth it is actually a no nonsense pen only thingsince i had read a few negative reviews about thisi am using it with pilot blue ink i dont know whether ink quality is further improving its performance or what whatever it may bethis pen with pilot ink combination rocksjust superb experience of writing with the fountsin pen thank you camlin and thank you amazon

3,i bought this item in august and the delivery and packaging was as good and sturdy as ive come to expect from amazon using the printer from my macbook is a breeze over wifi although printing over wifi from android requires some poorly designed app from canon and has no direct supportthe only couple of issues i faced with this printer were during setup scanning the qr code for the setup guide didnt actually lead to much of a guide rather a boilerplate page i would only much later find out the way from that page to the actual guide canon could do a better job of surfacing the online guide as the image clarity in the included hard copy is quite poor installation of cartridges seemed to take forever i must have removed and reinserted them almost times before they were properly detected no error messages showed up and i didnt know if i had recieved a faulty product or if i was doing something wrong never having owned a printer and always using either copy shops or the huge laser printers at work i ended up making a mistake in setting up the paper tray leading to a jam at the first print itself thankfully it was straightforward to open up the printer from the back side and remove the torn pieces canon could do a better job of demonstrating how to set up the paper sheets clearer access to the online guide mightve helped hereexcept for the these minor concerns in setup im enjoying using this printer surprisingly since printers alongside projectors are usually the worst items ever developed by the electronics industry ive used all the features so far print colored double sided scan and copy and not faced any issues with quality wifi or the cartridges information on the number of color and blackandwhite sheets from the initial set of cartridges to be added when i run outgood scanner printerinstallation procedure is very simple and priter quality is high i had a xerox copier but istallation of scanner option could not completeif you are purchasing it for your home use dont look any further it has got all the functions youll find in a k worth printers all in one includes print scan copy and fax as well colour adf duplex printing wifi you download the app in ur phone and give print commands via mobile itself only two issue that i faced firstly the print qualitywhich ill speak to the service center and secondly is the total quantity of color prints i have only taken out couple of color printouts bad already the level of ink is i guess ill have to purchase a larger cartridgevery good printer sometimes back to back printing cases paper blockage but overall very happygud printer but printing cost is expensive in this price range features are very nicei got this printer ion nov after days of usage im unable to print as it is showing color black ink is low i have print less than pages and in description they told that pages yield which is totally wrongcannon ethis was launched as a successor for e i searched everywhere but couldnt find a credible source to explain the differences between the two i researched extensively before purchase to find a printer which will fullfil the following criteria for me wifi enabled so that we can print with smartphone without opening the laptop clear color print decent for childs homework photo quality not required and cheap to run e seem to fit all the criteria so i ordered this even the canon authorised showroom didnt have e in stock so ordered the e off amazonsummary fullfills top two criteria though is a little expensive if you do more than the occasional printdelivery was days earlier than the delivery date shown on amazon so that was great it was just the printer box with no outer packing the box was sealed with cello tape and not sealed so i suspect it had been opened at some point thankfully all the components were there and the seal on the printer and cartridges were intact so i was ok with the deliverysetup was smooth on both my smartphone and laptop over wifi i never had to use the usb cable setup was through the canon app on phone and the canon website link for both given in manual which guides step by step on how to setup i did not face any challenges and the setup and printing has been smooth from all devicescolor prints are a bit faded on plain paper gsm this might be a function of the paper and not the printer the blackwhite prints are crisp and sharp the print speed is decentthe only negative is the amount of ink consumption while the box says color prints and bw both my cartridges are showing at after color print and around bw specially for color prints the printer tends to drop the cartridge level by a notch after just prints i suspect the color cartridge will not last longer that full color pages refilling the cartridges a few times is of course an option but it is messy and requires practice this is fine for me as i need color prints very rarelya special mention for the adf and duplex printing both the features are extremely useful duplex printing is especially unique in this price range and comes in very handy while printing larger documentsoverall i am happy with my purchase after couple of weeks of usage i will update the review if i run into any issues

4,product is good its definitely a peace for ears because the padding is also very good one thing that i dont like is the wire is too shortnever expected an easy on pocket brand like boat winning heart the way apple does good product in rsgood productsuperbthe headphones live up to your expectations coming at an affordable pricethe sound quality is top notch talking about the noise cancellation feature it indeed cancels out the exterior noise i had put it on my ears played a song and simultaneously played another song on my tv i really could not hear my tvs sound i liked the design and it feels quite appealingnow i have two problems with the headphones firstly being it cannot be put on for a longer period of time adds a little bit of stress over your ears and they start to ache not much though but thats quite a concern second being the length of the wire its very long and often it annoys you because it doesnt get fit into pockets and all quite easily overall a quality product at this rate and i recommend to buy anyone whos interested and willing to give a shot at buying this headphonespackaging of the product can be much better im unsatisfied with the delivery of this productit was my second boat product which i have purchased and st headphone more than five hundred and its experience is simply awesome i have been using it past monthsthe sound quality is perfect even when the sound volume is around the sound is very good for price and mic quality is also decent but it is not comfortable your ears feel pain when you take it off but for this price range it is the best thing
3,super productworst producttoo good productgoodsince long i was waiting for someone to manufacture a simple mobile set of pocket radio size so that i could listen online stations with reasonable sound quality as we know what ever qualities a modern mobile set may have the audio produced by it is always dry with no bass content so either we have to connect it to a music system or have to use headphones which are harmful to ears in the long run recently when i was surfing internet i saw this product which looked like an old radio on verifying the details i found this fulfills my requirement and without delay i placed orderzebronics astra is having excellent audio quality with sufficient bass and treble content just like radios of olden days the hollow space around the speaker adds to the bass effect if we rotate the set and make the speaker to face us the sound becomes more crisp even with full volume sound does not distortbluetooth connectivity also is marvelous and connects within no time and there are no breaks and delay in audio transmission battery backup also appears to be good after fully charging once i am using it daily and after days still it is showing charge though there is no provision to know the remaining charge in the product the mobile from which we are connecting bluetooth shows the detailsnormally we can not expect much from fm radio in such type of gadgets but this product is exception for that by attaching a small wire to the whip antenna i could listen fm station situated km away as if was local oneaux usb and msd card facilities also work wellbut i felt the onoff switch should have been some what sturdy long press type button would have been a better option also scanning of fm stations should have been on long press instead of single press to avoid accidental scanningover all it is a great productto give it a nostalgic look while enjoying online radio i used the picture of our old national ekco radios tuning dial as the home screen of the mobilei use this for personl tv audio listening as wellchidambar kakathkarmangalorepoor sound qualityworthyyou cant use it if the mobile is slim or more petite i bought this for my mom her mobile is a slim model and doesnt have a case and the mobile keeps falling if you tilt it overall it is a good product

3,somehow amazon sucks when you want to select an electric kettle there are no options to filter your choices based on the parameters that matter it is easy to fall into the trap of an ongoing deal and end up buying something that falls short of what you need in this review i will answer your questions about the pigeon amaze plus l electric kettle can i trust the reviews for this ad are they genuineprobably yes but know that the seller lists several types of pigeon kettles in the same ad unless the review refers to this particular model you could well end up seeing a review of a product and buying a different one the ratings are also an aggregated mix there could be negative review of the product you are seeing and positives for the other products the page will show you a neutral review thats the game sellers are playing these days to avoid negative reviews i have posted a picture of the stove i am referring to in this review wattage important because this tells how quickly the water will heat up this one is w meaning that you can switch it on brush your teeth and find the water is boiled great time saving my earlier one was w and it used to take minutes of patient waiting the gas stove boiled water faster this one takes about mins to heat mugs of coffee cable length most of these kettle makers skimp on the cable length i have purchased kettles to find they have only a foot long cable and i had to return them this one has cable length of slightly more than one meter which is allows a comfortable distance between the kettle and the plug connector this one uses a a plug which is most common in india be careful because from w onwards most kettles use a a plug and that is not always available at the place where you want to place the kettle strictly speaking it should have a a plug but then this is kept on for short intervals only capacity litres as mentioned though i could not see markings for max and min levels this is good enough to make decent sized mugs of coffee cooking other stuff the ad says only water but i see no reason why you cannot heat maggi etc maybe you can but avoid milk as the expanding effect will cause spills and this can have adverse effects looks quite okay for the price it will not make your kitchen look bad and neither will it enhance the looks this is the most common look that an electric kettle can have performance i have used for days only no complaints so far there is a year guarantee card accompanying the product handle very convenient feel when you lift it it from the heating cradle does not feel very heavy even if there is a full l of water negatives this is a steel jug the outside will automatically heat up if you are used to a plastic outside in your previous kettle you need to be a little carefulverdict buyat the time of writing this review this costs less than rs i have seen that sellers tend to inflate prices as they get my positive reviews therefore i am also mentioning the price range based on which i gave this product a star reviewthe body is very lightweight and doesnt feel sturdy does the job of heating water fast and thats it cord length could be a little longer the plastic parts doesnt feels sturdy the top cap has a smaller dia so a mans hand has a trouble fitting it inside the container during cleaning and can easily cut our hands overall its okayits quality was not too much good light quality product but according to price its okayeasy to use product good for save timegood product for boiling water shock proof so no worrieshahahacattle bass fitting not currentlygood productgo for itamazing product

3,if you are buying this as a secondary cooking appliance or you need a portable stove go for thisalso buy thin induction compatible utensils it takes a very long time for thick vessels to heat up before you can start cookingas a primary cooking appliance this doesnt suit as its very time consuming can be used for keeping things hot or slow boiling milk etcalso had to request a warranty repair the request was served within days the contact information is present on the warranty cardjust received it though the product looks new there are few scratches here and there making me unhappycompared its performance with other induction cook top that i have with same amount of water at same temperature in the same vesselsadly this cook top is a tad slow to boil compared to the old onebut i think that is okay because the old one which i have is rs more than this oneproduct good but its take long time to cooldownकमल क परडकट हgoodvalue for moneygood producteasy to operatevalue for money
3,this review is after month use of the kettel product is good if you need to heat water not milkinitially there were no issue in auto cut but last week it stopped workingoverall in this price range i will say yes for thisvery useful my needs are fulfilled thank yougood productproduct looks good but boiling milk in this kettle burns the base of the kettle it becomes full black and brown and eggs dont get boiled in a single go nice productafter months of usage some issues have come up once it gets to the boiling point it should automatically switch off but it keeps on bubbling till it is switched off manually next is that the water vapors and heat can be felt through the kettle onoff switch which i believe is dangerous we ordered this trusting prestige to be of high quality but it doesnt satisfy the purposeafter using only one month kettle on off switch is not working and red light is also not workingsome times its boiling time is too fast and some times too slowthis catle works good but difficult to clean
4,the lint remover actually removes the lint it is not a gimmick but an actual working machine it gives new life to the winter clothes which were of no use due to heavy lint all around using this small machine you can remove lint and see the difference i used it on clothes and am very happy with the result let me describe the pros and conspros very easy to use removes any kind of lint it also removes lint that is not visible ie of the same color which gives rough look to the cloth making it look older so your clothes look a bit like the new ones lint is collected in a container that is easy to cleancons the process is very very slow you need to move the machine on the cloth surface a number of times the build quality is plasticky like cheap toys it may break if fallen on a hard surface the cable length is very small the plug comes off the socket easily you need to sit very close to the socket making it a bit difficult to use sometimes the lint collector comes off very often the rotor blades make a weird noise as if they are going to break the biggest problem is that you need to sit for prolonged periods to make your clothes lintfree which strains your neck badly and if you are suffering from cervical then forget it you will use it once and will never touch it again however you can make an arrangement to hang the clothes on a wall hanger and remove lint by keeping your neck straightother than that it is a good product and can be triedthanksproduct is good overall working fine but the seller should pack it more carefully as i received the upper detachable part in a broken condition as it is non replaceable makes it more difficult for the customerbut coming to the working part the product quality is good wotks fina and removes everything easilya must buy product for winteri have used a similar product earlier but this one works better and size is also very effective using is very ergonomic and like i said does the job well come with a small brush to bruah off samll residue on the fabric would recommend buying this delivery and packaging was good tooeasy to clean easy to use does the job received the product fast and in perfect condition there is a leaflet inside promising month warranty if it provides that its teh perfect product for this pricethis is very product it cleans all lint from my woolen clothes but it have dislike store area is very less and slim it have problem for cleaning store area and the product is very goodthis is very good life save in winters to remove lint from your costly winter wear i have used it on some heavy lint area in my inner wear and its really removed the lints and now i can wear my inner againproduct is so satisfying and easy to use that a child can remove lint from his clothes product overall is satisfying expect the the compartment where lint get consolidated it gets loose in every movementproduct is good and solve the lint problem very effectively so go for it

4,reviewing just after a day of using this product we made french fries and chicken tikka and result is quiet impressive the recipe book and cooking tips from the given qr code is really helpful hope it serves for a long timenot to forget about the beautiful bottle green and golden look of it detailed user manual no idea about the cooking time how to use is not describeit works well and plastic quality is poor but it can wothstand the temperature for sure its not a toy to look for high quality plastic and for the half the price that the other models we can ignore thatfunctionality wise its perfectjust buy itdont go for costly products as it is available in a reasonable price and it has so many great features im happy with itpigeon never dissapointd with their quality the best way to have healthy crispy foodthe outcome of cooked is not up to the mark the recipe book was not attached so it is difficult to know how to cook different dishes i tried some but outcome was bad definitely you will have to compromise taste if you use this appliance im very much worried about the current consumption think before you buy these air fryers
4,good product specially for hostelers value for money and it looks good in your roomitem is very good and met my expectationit is good for single or double people sharing roomi really recommend this best product usefulgood product in this price go for this
4,update as on the power cord has developed twists beyond repair and the seperate cores are now visiblethe insulation pvc of the cores doesnt look very durablei dont know why such standard manufacturers cant provide a decent durable cablethe iron however is performing flawlesslystill disappointed as in coming weeks ill have to change the cable for surereducing one star for compromising upon the cable quality by such a big brand namehow it started the need for an ironxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxrecently my previous bajaj make dry iron which i received as a gift from somewhere started giving problems after two years of occasional use with not so careful handling and care initially its wires insulation inside was found rotten around the iron entry point which i repaired myself and later its thermostat started giving problems finally its on indication went off and i decided that it was time to bid goodbye to it and find a new onehence my search for a reputed brand make best value for money device began being from electrical engineering background occupation i fairly summed up my expectations from the power device as below dry iron vs steam iron xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxthis was fairly simple if we consider the explanation that a steam iron could perform as a dry iron but viceversa was not possible also almost always you find some or the other stubborn wrinkles and crease distortions that is hard for the dry iron to overcome and you need to use water for the purposeon the contrary as the steam loosens the individual fibres of the clothes the steam irons pressing action smooths out wrinkleshence it was better to be equipped with the facility in the first place in the device itself brand reputation warrantyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxas an average consumer we are not wrong in generally assuming that products of bigger established brands have a higher quality and perform better rightfully so a brand which has been working with a product for decades has a plenty of experience research regarding the possible points of failures of the product and can be surely trusted uponfollowing the same footprints i thought not to take bets upon power devices like iron and go with the super brands like philips having decades of expertise in this fieldour product comes with a two year global warranty which is quite decent in my opinion steam output steam burst vertical steam featurexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxduring normal usage with steam a delivery of anything above gramsmin is okay but some ironing jobs such as curtains or quilts require a much more supply of steam in such cases the steam burst feature comes in handy users can push a button to receive a burst of steam when needed more holes in the sole plate add to the effectiveness of steam suppliedvertical steam feature in theory can direct clouds of steam in and around vertically hung garments or curtains which eliminates wrinkles without the need for a pressing forcehowever in practical scenario and by virtue of its design and water tank limitations a steam iron is virtually incapable of addressing the wrinkles like that and hence paying more for such a feature is not adviseduse dedicated garment steamers for that purpose our philips gc comes with a variable setting for steam output with a continuous delivery of up to gramsmin which is quite goodadditionally it can provide steam burst too for stubborn wrinkles vertical steam feature is not available though electrical related features wattage cordthermostat etcxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxthe simple maths that more watts means more heat or more steam or quick heating is not as simple as it looks surely more watts means more heat generated but more wattage limits our ability to plug the iron at any socket in the house as for any power above watts i would suggest to only plugin to the power socketsgoing for more power demands must be backed up with careful examination as to whether you really need that much heating if its normal clothes only that you need to iron most of the times surely more heat developed is capable to deliver more steam but that depends upon the number of holes in your sole plate for it to be really effective your water holding tank size and lastly steam delivery settingsgenerating too much steam without delivery can be dangerous as it can pressurize the system last but not the least more power doesnt always mean quick heating as heating of the sole plate depends upon a number of factors like the material thickness of the sole plate surface area of the heating element used inside the soleplate etcmost of these intricate details are variable in nature and cannot be specifically mentioned by the manufacturer our product comes with a decent watts of power good enough for routine casual use along with occasional use on heavier fabrics comes with a volts amp max rating of plug is always extra to actual amperage pin top which can be easily plugged into our casual amp sockets as well without any damage to the sockethence enhanced mobility performance the cord length is around meters which is good enough for any practical lengthsany more than that would be cumbersome to handle the cord is braided with an insulated cotton sleeve which is useful for twists as well as insulating during a cable damagehowever in due course of use the cord often develops rigid twists turns beneath the cotton braiding which is hard to straighten outso not so great on the cable quality terms the cable only comes with degrees of swivel movement which is quite disappointing and i would have really wished if it was degrees of cord freedom the thermostat knob for temperature selection comes with regular settings but going with a reputed brand like philips always assures of a good quality of thermostatafter all the thermostat is the heart and soul of modern day irons and must be highly durable and reliable lastly our product is an isi marked product which is quite an assurance for sure soleplate material shapexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxthis is probably the toughest part where each company claims to have the best and easy gliding soleplatesa variety of soleplates are available in the market today like nonstick teflon coated aluminium plates with american heritage coating steel plates with alloys or ceramic coatedeach has its pros and cons teflon coated plates are easy to get scratched and gather dirt over a period of time american heritage is similar to teflon and glides over the fabric even better stainless steel is the most durable and easy to clean however may stick to clothes on higher settingsadds weight to the device metal works better than ceramic for pressing in sharp creases on sleeves and trousers good for smooth gliding and even heat distribution but biggest advantage is to eliminate static charge at high temperatures which may cause clothes to stickwhen ironing on synthetics and fabrics blended with spandex a ceramic iron will suit your needs best as ceramic does not stick to these fabrics but the coating may peel off on rough handling aluminium soleplates heat up quickly but are prone to damage and may stick to clothes our product comes with a linished soleplate which is quite inadequate detail as linishing is a process of grinding or polishing a surface to make it a perfect flat however apart from linishing stuff i can surely say that the soleplate in our device is decent gliding but not the best gliding its heavy but doesnt stick to the clothes yetfor that matter i trusted the brand reputation and went ahead with this linished soleplate stay away from teflon coated ones though as its bound to wear off fastregarding the shape i honestly wanted it to look like american fighter planes with sharp beak design and dark colorslolhowever those models with my looks were weak in overall specs so had to settle down with this stilldecent looking model features like anti drip anticalc gripxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxto tell you the truth these are more of a fancy terms rather than actual purpose for most of the users presence of these features isnt a problem though as in areas where the water comes hard anticalc may stir and clear the calcium build up if any in the water tankhowever if you use proper water drain it out timely do not fully fill the tank allow it to heat before using steam follow all procedures correctly you wont actually need to use these featuresregarding grip many iron nowadays have some unique design which is set ergonomically to give a better grip our product comes with the anticalc function and is decent to grip though i think not ergonomically still nothing for a deal breaker and these are minor features to discuss upon price vs performancexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxeven though i did not have any preset price tag in my mind but still going over would have definitely felt extreme for a thing that i dont make use of that much i bought it at a price of around bucks for all the features and performance it delivers i think it is worth itfinal verdictxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxall in all i would just say that even though our product might not have the best appealing looks or the best soleplate or the best burst of steam or the best swivel of the cord still what it has is a complete package of all the individual features clubbed together in a decent rightperforming way which is hard to come by in an individual modeli got this one ondemand from mother for a few days she was insisting on buying one iron for daily chores i was already researching iron for one of my friends so this search did not last long deven earlier philips was the only name that came to my mind due to its consistency product quality i also had bajaj usha morphy in the list but trust in philips did not let me go for any other brandi got this iron well in one piece and without any scratches on the soleplateinside boxsteam iron inside

quality iron with effective ironing steaming body is solid with good finish overall at this range linished teflon coated soleplate for easy gliding on all fabrics gliding is somewhat limited in steam mode due to moisture sufficiently long cable with swivel joint at iron for easy movement and usage capacity of the water tank is sufficient for average steaming operation min or more in one fill spray function is well designed it evenly sprays water and not just throws a fine jet of water the spray function produces a fine mist that evenly moistens the fabric making it easier to iron out tough creases wattage w is sufficient enough for home usage and can easily cover tough wrinkles and heavy clothes easy and fast filling of the tank owing to the huge filling hole easy and complete emptying of the water tank owing to the large hole and the sideways opening door weight on the ok side not a lightweight but not even heavyweight some weight is useful as it helps ironing by applying pressure on the cloth empty iron is lightweight onlycons steam control knob looks loose at first but it works well in the long run water movement during iron creates jerks and affects smooth operation but thats the way it will work you cant do anything for regular lightweight iron users it will appear bulky at first but you get used to it in a few days no steam burst function in this model gc but you

the tank to the max level if planning to use steam function connect to mains set the temperature control knob to the required position let it warm up until the indicator goes off now operate steam knob to low or high steam enjoy ironing or steaming without interruption till water lasts use water spray function as requiredusage tips use ro filtered water if possible as its low in hardness and will ensure the longevity of iron without choking the vents or orifices let the iron heat properly before use leakage has been observed if one uses the iron without heating properly as water will directly pass from vents without getting converted to steam gently clean soleplate and dont use any hard material or chemicals emptying water tank every time after usage is recommended to avoid scaling problem as calcium deposits are more in standing water untangle straighten the cord once after every use before storage as these cords tend to develop sharp irrecoverable turns over time and those are hot zones for cable failure when not using steam function keep the steam knob in off position use calc clean mode once in weeks if using normal tap water with medium hardness if water is very hard increase the frequency or if using ro water decrease frequency once in a few months clean steam control needle using vinegar to remove the needle rotate the knob to calc clean mode and gently pull it out last but most important use a properly earthed wall socket for iron to avoid shockscalc cleaning modethis iron has a calc cleaning mode to descale it to do so follow the steps below keep knob in the steam off position fill tank to max level rotate temperature dial to max position and wait for the indicator to go off take out socket from mains and move iron to sink turn the steam knob to calc clean position and pull it up a few cms let all water be used up steam and hot water come out along with calcium deposits the principle behind this function is a sudden change in temperatures of inside zone which leads to contraction expansion resulting in scaling shredding and flush outclarification damage to body or plate other issues concerns raised by other usersseveral users posted about the damaged product or soleplate on arrival and other usage issues let me put my insights into those i had no issue with the quality of the product delivered it arrived in proper condition without any damage anywhere as proper care was taken for this using air cushions maybe their seller was careless enough and that resulted in damage during transit soleplate had no marks on it yes here philips can provide a protective sticker or film on the plate which will reduce the ratio of complaints for the damaged sole plate on arrival temperature dial works properly and markings are intact after months of usage slight difference in color tone maybe there across different zones as different materials are used as per requirement say hot zone near plate vs cold zone at back leakage will be there if the steam knob is in steam position and iron is not sufficiently hot to convert incoming water so its passed directly appears as leakage philips has explicitly mentioned this in product details remember to order it from a reputed seller check seller ratings reviews and amazon verified tag to avoid any issues like the faulty product duplicate product etcdont get confused theres no steam burst mode here some of the photos displayed are with steam burst function symbol on the button even some users have mentioned this in their reviews but it is not present in this model models with the said function have two buttons for spray burst instead of one here for spray only also steam output at one place is gmin another place gmin its actually gminfinal verdict if you are looking for good quality durable steaming iron in the k range philips is the name you should seek for this model of philips has got good build quality features which are more than enough for an average home user so at any point you can go for this model if on a lower budget k range you can go for philips gc w or bajaj mx w but both are low power and philips one misses steam spray function too but still both will cover most of the usage pattern of a home user heavy users may go for philips easyspeed plus gc w or blackdecker bd bxirin w or morphy richards super glide w in k rangenote unlike regular lightweight irons steam irons generally dont go easy with repairs unlike regular iron if the coil is damaged in the steam iron whole of the bottom plate needs to be replaced if you are out of warranty it will cost you a lot in fact for the cost of the plate plus a few bucks you get a new iron so check your requirement for regular vs steam iron choose wiselyi tried removing hard wrinkles of a jeans but it couldnt remove them properly they were still visible even after using the steameasyto use but it leaks watervery goodits a good productiron is good and the best delivery with few hours just this iron doesnt have a stream burstrest is goodsimple cloth iron
4,immersion heaters have changed very little in terms of features or design over the years or so ive been using them and regardless of which brand name is stamped on them they look like clones of each other it was therefore with some excitement that i bought this havells model that had at least three novel features an autocutoff facility a temperature control knob and a protective plastic cover for that part of the heater users could come into accidental contact with but quite a bit of my excitement drained away when the heater arrived i couldnt use it straightaway because it has a cord thats barely a metre long and it just couldnt reach the a socket it needs to be plugged into such heavyduty sockets are normally positioned high in most bathrooms so that they are easily accessible to any storage waterheaters that may be installed havells should have made allowances for this and added at least another footandahalf to the cord length for a largescale manufacturer this extra length would have made little difference to the production cost the product anyway is priced a couple of hundred rupees more than other w heaters the mrp being even higher at rsin my case therefore the heater had to be accessorized before it could be used i had to buy a stool that would raise the the bucket off the floor and thus compensate for the shortness of the cord and no it cant be any stool lying around in your home it has to be a stool of a certain height about inches for me any taller and the bucket cant be accommodated under the tap any shorter and you begin cursing havells again for their miserliness with the cord the stool took two days to arrive and i inaugurated the heater a full four days after it was delivered thank god my old immersion heater was still usable in spite of its heavily calcified conditionthere is yet another problem with this heater though it helpfully allows you to choose between three temperature settings you dont know what value each setting corresponds to what does high temperature mean degrees celsius seventy i found out the hard way when i set the temperature high and the heater wouldnt switch itself off for minutes which is five minutes longer than the time my old heater takes to heat up some litres of water and by then the water had turned scaldingly hot i tried the medium setting the next day and again had the nasty experience of having to deal with extra hot water perhaps the right setting is low then im not sure neither the product literature that came with the heater nor the havells website has any information that will help you choose the right setting and stop you burning yourselfso both the innovative features of this heater that made me buy it the variable heat setting and the autocutoff ultimately turned out to be quite useless i still have to depend on my instinct and on my experience with my old featureless heater and manually turn the heater off when i think its done its jobi have a question for other users of this product or for the manufacturer can the temperature be set to inbetween values something between low and medium for instance the way the controlling knob is marked with several lines between the presets suggests this is possible or maybe thats yet another useless feature of this fancy heater more trialanderror but should such a basic piece of equipment be so difficult to useupdateafter a weeks use of this heater id like to add a word of caution for the benefit of other buyers and users since the heater has its own indicator light which switches off at the set temperature you may forget to switch the socket switch off particularly if the switch is away from the socket as in some contemporary bathrooms that have all switches bunched together at the bathroom door if you forget to switch the socket off and in the meantime have removed the heater from the bucket it will begin to heat up again once the temperature has fallen below the set value this dryheating will damage both the heater and wall if youve hung the heater up but more significantly it will also be extremely hazardous if your body is wet and theres no one around to switch the socket off for you this happened to me twice call me dumb if you want to but please be carefulthe product is good and does its work i didnt find any use of the thermostat feature as though it turns off automatically the low temper in itself is very hot it take just to mins to get the water be bath ready further the product says that ilthe rod should not touch the bucket but the product handle is made in such a way that it touches but that causes no trouble its not shock proof so dont check temperature of water with it turned onproduct received with some scratchesdont know how inside package product gets scratchesother than that all is okay product is goodand its shock proof for extra safety but no recommended to touch watervalue for moneyproduct is good satisfactory one minor issue the cord is little too hardits working as expected no issues found till now but i have observed the red light is not coming fully i could see only partial red light is visible overall best productnicethis product is very good and easy to use but its plug is of amps which should have been of amps
4,i have been using this product from past few days and it removes lint very efficiently very handy to use however sometimes some lint remains below blades and not completely expelled but after cleaning it works fine overall ill be giving it stara good productwould recommend to purchase a branded product than a non branded productreally like the productoverall good productagaro is the bestits a nice product working just fine without any issues and built quality is nice as wellwireless product
3,bottle quality is not goodbest for hot water per the price bottle is not sturdy and very light weight kettle is also thin but heats fast like other market standard both bottle and kettle should be sturdy has to handle very delicately otherwise dent will be inevitablethe product is a good package the bottle accompanied is a regular steel bottle and not a thermos the kettle is very difficult to clean so better avoiding doing anything which stains it the switch seemed to get jammed but with a little push it started to work againsteel quality not goodthe kettle is good for winters you can boil the water within a few minutes but the length of cord is short it would be better if it is longoverall the experience was good you can go for it it is truly an amazing product for your parents thats why im rating it stargood

3,value for moneyheat power goodone loss point that is temperature control bottom not addedmy year old mother finds it effective and easy to useits tiny and easily warms up the room portable it will stop if we turn the knob close to minus or if there is fluctuations in the current else its finehi team seller i would like to bring to notice that the while operating there is very irritating noise that is not very good while workingnot up to the mark havells with such brand figure has failed miserably to justify the same heating capacity is good for delhi chilling cold but the sound or noise is very irritatingits good for making a room hot with temperaturegood purchase feet cord lambi hoti toh max aata mazzza
4,i am writting this after months usuage go for it as suction power is too good only cons is dust capacity is very limited as we need to clean frequentlyits too heavy to be handle and not good for deep cleaning i tried to clean matresses and sofa but dusts were theretoo early to write the review but working good so farlikes handy easy to use comparatively light cleans extremely well due to strong suction power looks good good clean design power cord is very long easy to store doesnt take up much spacedislikes heated up quite a lot within minutes not even minutes after cleaning an upholstered stool and foot rug had to switch off and let it cool so obviously not something that can be used at a stretch to clean all your upholstery etc like othermore expensive vacuum cleaners no flexible hose with the more expensive version with extension stick when one has paid much more providing the small flexible hose which is meant for cleaning inaccessible areas like underneath sofas ceilings etc was something i expected im sure the hose itself is pretty inexpensive they could easily have provided it at no extra cost if one needs that hose one needs to buy the less expensive unit again just to get the hose as its not even available for sale separately manual is hopelessly inadequate had to look up youtube videos no soft brush provided for cleaning the filter does not come in amazon packaging even though its fulfilled by amazon its just the agaro box think is closed by openable flaps not even sealed so we cannot be sure if its a returned defective product or brand new one no quality check sticker or anything assuring that the product has been checked before packing on a youtube video there was a sticker at the joint of dust connector and main body on mine there is no sticker just slight sticky residue so its been removed by someone not sure if its a returned product again as there is no seals on the box i dont want to return this as i already had returned one box that was filthy with oil stains and had opened from the bottom flaps had come apart none of the attachments etc were sealed in their plastic cover packets quite loud reading the reviews i thought it would be less noisy but its not no blower function other brands in this range have would have been great to have this only attachments floor carpet brush multipurpose brush crevice nozzle other brands in this range have many more an extra filter would have been a good gesture to include not very light if one wants to clean high surfaces like sides of ceiling or ceiling fans etc one needs to lift it and hold in hand while cleaning very difficult to do especially for ladies or at least me a middleaged lady again here the flexible hose if provided would have been handy someone could hold the vacuum cleaner while using the hose to clean high areasall in all reasonably happy with this purchase as it is a supplementary one to my existing year old eureka forbes vacuum cleaner which is still going strong as the upholstery cleaning attachments for that model got losti do feel strongly though that the price could have been reduced considering all the above pros and conscompact sizeit is a light duty light usage and a limited application area equipment not for effective complete usageits a good vaccum good suction and easy to clean up however the suction sound is quite loud nevertheless its a good machine does the job wellthe product works well it just heats up after using for mins
4,i recvd product within dys while owing to rural area other product tks dys to deliver n product recvd at gd condition n works well aftr use if smthng cms up will review againit works good nice heating but hard to clean as it has ridges and small gap between the hot plate and the controls and also below the plate edges other than that fine product se jyada price nahi hona chahiye tha use karne mein bahut achha haiover all im really disappointed by the product and especially cooking experience i was used to normal gas and it was easy to regulate to propper temperature this product has only like temperature settings and it is either too hot or too cold and cannot be set in middle for example when i set c then it is burning toasts and onions when i set one step lower it is c and it is not enough for frying also you need to buy more expensive induction friendly cookware and even when i invest to expensive tefal pan it heat mostly in the center and it is much colder on the edges you can see on pictures that watter boiling only in middle and toast being burnt in middle and raw outside the pan is very good and has induction area over whole bottom so im sure the fault is in this philips stove you can see the pan from bottom that induction area is almost over whole bottom also due to fact that only center is hot then frying onions is taking much longer than on normal gas stove where heat is better distributed and even though you spent more time frying the onions the result is worse onion is little burned from outside and still not soft inside im really disappointed by frying experience compared to gas stovethere is one positive side and that is that heating is quick my pressure cooker star whistling quite quickly faster than on gas stove also you can set time for like minut and leave it which is quite convenientcontroll is easy but i hate details first i love one detail there is pause button which is very cool if something heats too quickly or you just need to quickly do something else you press pause button and there is no new heat it is much nicer compared to gas stove where you would need to turn off light up again and then find right flame again here you just press pause again and cook as before but that is only thing that i love otherwise i hate how it is designed first basiclly whole top row of buttons is useless those buttons are preset temperatures but anyway those temperatures are wrong or just for items you do not cook like there is stirr fry button and it set c it totally burns onion i set usually c for beginning and then soon change for c but even c is too much burning but lower setting is only c which is not frying at all i would need like c i guess and it is impossible to set also i noticed another issue that stove is sometimes making automatic pauses it heats and than probably when it thinks it is too hot then it stop completelly and in like seconds starts again so instead of consistentn temperatures it is doing on and offbut back to controll except from fact that preset temperatures are useless when you want to change temperature it wont let you or let you to do only one but not times why i dont know probably ill will you need to first press manual button which change temperature completely to c and only then you can freely press and set your desired temperature so basically i never use any preset mode and i always only press manual and to set my temperatureanother control is setting time i must say satting time is useful feature and i love it but how it is implemented i hate when you press time button then by default it set minutes ok but when you hold button it jumps so quickly that in one second it counts to and roll to hours holding incrementdecrement is so quick that it is useless it must have implement some idiot anyway you can always click one by one so to set minutes you must click time button and then click times minus button to set minutes it is doable but pretty annoying or i long press it usially jumps directly to hours and then i press times still anoying but i save like clicks what is super idiotic is that when i want to add minutes i click time and it by default set minutes again arrrrggghhhhh so instead of just click time and times i need to click times really this must have done some idiot another unpleasant thing is that if you need to change temperature you can not imagine something starts burning and you need to wait like seconds and not pressing and then after those seconds time setting mode is automatically left and it will let you change temperatures again when controlling stupidity is burning my food it makes me angry so over all i would buy anything else next time maybe it will be worse but i would at least tryanyway to say something positive at the end i like that product looks quite durable and material quality looks good packaging was also well but power cable is only like meters that might be too short but for me just enough also i like mechanic buttons some stove has capacity buttons which is cool looking and totally flat but i like to feel the press and the click buttons are under foil so there is no risk of something leaking into them cleaning is very easy cos it is almost flat cleaning experience is much better than cleaning gas stoveproduct is good but service center problem not available nearlynoतल

3,recieved the package today the product came intact upon opening the product saw some white powdery stuff all around the edges had to wipe it off and checked if all functions worked properlyit seems easy to use and all functions worked good there are dedicated options for even deep frying which some brands dont have will update the review after using it for a whilegood qualitygood productgood product good productworks fine issue with delivery product bit damagedsatisfiedits timer functions is so easy
4,i have used it mainly for boiling water knob turned maximum to right so cannot comment much about lower temperature settings it takes about min for water to boil suggest mfr to release in other colour like light blue etc as i see some other kettles it may add to the looks and give a warm feeling in the room the stainless steel looks shiny but the material is not very thick but its ok for the price there may be formation of scaling or white brownish spots on the base of kettle in a c shape due to the c shaped half coil at base funny design maybe a product created by modifying a higher wattage full circular coil kettle the scales are more when tap water is used due to higher presence of salts maybe they seem to get cleaned by usual scrubbing given wide based cylinder shape it is very easy to cleanto be aware the kettle does not autoshut off when water boils similarly the kettle temperature will be kept warm at knob setting unless the knob is at the leftmost when it shuts off else the water will keep drying out until it dries out completely and then the kettle is supposed to auto shut off to prevent dry heating i havent tested this though these are mentioned in the manual so this can be thought of as a warmer boiler so you cannot leave the kettle unattended thinking that it will auto shut off like other kettles when the water has started to boil i assume this is designed this way to allow a bit of cooking for those who want to use it in that manneraccessories cannot fathom what the use is of the plastic bowl provided given that plastics can leach chemicals when heated i would not suggest to use it inside the kettle in any way eg steaming a steel rack is given too that could be used alongwith some steel plate with holes for steam cooking but there is none provided with the product itselffinal verdict if you are ok with a somewhat slower heating kettle but with more versatility and easy to clean at a reasonable price this will do the job if a similar product was available with higher wattage at a higher price i would have bought that insteadi wanted to give star rating because agaro forces its customers to give rating and review to get the warranty it is a bad practice you cannot force customer to give rating as i mentioned it may result in the product having negative rating on amazon despite being a good productin my opinion the product itself is good it heats water very fast it is good for making maggie pasta and boiling eggs but need to be careful while making maggie or pasta because once they get dry they start to stick to the bottomthe kettle is very easy to cleanthe cord length should have been longerone issue that i noticed that only one half of the base of kettle generates heateverything is good it has been very useful for me there is only one drawback i guess the heating is not uniform across the base of the kettle since whenever i boil milk or make teacoffee a portion of one side bunrs the milk even while boiling water i can see the similar symptomagaro multicooker is good and gives a variety of cooking boiling options like milk tea eggs maggi etconly negative point is that agaro team promises extended warranty of months by giving asking to give a positive review on amazon but fails to deliver on their promise and does not give any extended warrantydelivery has safe got item safelydelivery on time instantaneous water boiling sufficient space big volume best for hostel studentshope for warranty and company responsei liked how fast it does the work but i hate about the dirt it gets inside after cooking something it sticks theiroverall gorgeous product the most beautiful thing is that the cord length is big that is a better option for your kitchen and aslo that is the best option for hostel usersliked the design and operation however cord length could be longer temperature control is good but knob need some modifications overall happy with this product

4,useful for dark colour n delicate dresswhat an amazing product was quite sceptical before buying it after reading all these mixed reviews but glad i didsmoothens out the creases from dresses coats woollens and any fabric which is otherwise non ironable of course you cant expect it to crease out the cotton shirts but it is a very handy product especially if you are travelling also the steam sanitises the clothes making them odour freethe water tank is small and needs to be refilled again after about clothes but bigger tank would have made it heavy and difficult to operateoverall good purchaseloving this product while usingit does the job pretty wellthe cons according to me are you cannot use it with clothes placed on horizontal flat surfaces because the water doesnt reach the outlet in the tank if the tank is half empty the alternative is that the dress has to be hanged to a cloth hanger and then use the steamer be careful while steaming as it may burn the skin keep you palm at a safe distance while steaming the dress this may be an issue when you try to steam the sleeves of the garment and also for flowing dresses not all fabrics can be completely wrinkle free it sometimes leaves more steam and water at times leaving your garment with wet patches the garment feels wet after using the steamer you have to keep filling the tank twice for using it on one topeasy to use sturdy and does the job only thing is that it takes time to cool rest of all goodits an amazing product and easy to use just hang the cloth somewhere and start using thisgreat producteasy to carryfoldableand results greatan average product but the cost is too high as it doesnt completely satisfy your purpose
4,if u have to heat a small room you can definitely use this heater but people need to be near it to feel the heatproduct is nice and better only when you are close to it it cant cool the small room atleit is value for money and worth buying product best build quality in this price rangethe nice product and light weight very easy usable productgood product value for moneyi received the room heater its really very good this is very good productits good for smaller space
4,okay i have to say the following things quite noisy but not much not at the level where your land lord will come down and tell you to keep the noise down lock is good and easy to clean plastic quality is good handy and easy too use do not make it grind or blend for more than a minute in a single stretch the motor will start smokingi have a small kitchen so this is just perfect for me as it requires very less space on my countertop using it for the last weeks and i am happy with its grinding capacity design and blending performance so far i prefer making small batches of homemade spices and baby food cereals so its a very good option for me it is a good choice for powdering small quantities of spices it comes with blades onefor grinding and the other for extraction the extraction blade is suitable for making smoothiesto start with the look is very stylish and trendy i use it for smoothies milkshakes everydayit is very convenient for everyday use since its very quick for portion size use cleaning is also very simplelock mechanism is amazing and grinding technology is fascinating just fix rotate and it starts grindingonly disadvantage is the noise it makes while initial grindingthe product is quite nice and very compact firstly i faced issue while starting the nutri blender as it didnt start on its own i need to hold it tightly then it started to run otherwise the product is good overallit is good for grinding and blending for small quantitiesit is easy to use cleaning is also easy it is best for making juicessmoothies and all types of chutneys i do my cooking my cooking work fast with the help of this product as it takes less time to chop i recommended this productproduct size is small but product quality is not good i used this product for months and problems have arrived soon sometimes the blender doesnt work and all the time some black grease like substance keep coming out and get mixed with foodlike it and recommend itsmall jar not working

4,amazon delivery was prompt and on time received next day off ordering not even hr star for amazon and delivery product packing was very good guys product is good but you need to find your own ways to instalation for installation we had to call the customer service of crompton where in they registered the request and they provide the thirdparty installation team number for the specific area where in we have to call for installation they picked up the call registered the installation request and updated us they will call us back in minutes to confirm the installation time but there was no call back for two days and when we called back many times they dont even bother to pick up the call but they were promptly disconnecting the call company needs to check the credibility of service provider and take appropriate action otherwise brand popularity will go for a toss hope company takes appropriate actionpathetic installation service from crompton had to call them multiple times before assigning a mechanic the mechanic who came had knowledge about installation or the machine worried what they would provide in case of breakdown or machine malfunction would suggest users to think about the cons before purchase product is average nothing too exceptional to write about will suit you good enough not excellentis good to use but what i observed is that its heats the water at only not more than its not that hot to mix but its good if heat and ready to bath it takes around min to heat good to bath in winterinvoice should have been given inside the cartoon for problem in futureif any with the geyser takes more time to get hot watergood performancegood productfast heating that was good

4,bosch truemixx pro mixer grinder wattmgmmin blackreviewi usually do not write reviews but i felt i had to write this one because when i was researching which mixer to buy i found really bad reviews that do not do justice to the product i went with the trust on bosch brand name and am extremely satisfied with the product i have been using it daily sometimes multiple times in a day for past month during lockdown period i hope this will help othersmixer includes capacity mixer body plastic blender jar ml fruit filter wet grinding jar ml dry grinding jar ml chutney grinding jar ml extra pounding blade spatulabuild and overall appearance the mixergrinder watt motor is extremely powerfuli have used it to grind both dry wet ingredients such asgaram masala idlidosa mix chana dal paste poppy seeds pastecoconut chutney dry rice and urad dal powder ginger garlic paste ice etci regularly blend and make milk shakes lassis etc and have found it to very fast and convenient does the job fast within few secondsminutes depending on the amount and type of ingredients you are working with body is good looking sturdy well balanced and easy to wipe clean the vacuum feet are quite secure and give a true hands free experience overload protector for added safety helps if you overload the mixer by mistake the jars also are easy to use and quite wellbuiltjars blades the jars are metal with removable stainless steel blades chutney jar blade is fixed an extra blade is provided for stone pounding affect a spatula cum blade changer is provided the jar lids are made of transparent plastic each lid has a small top cap which can be removed to add liquidsmaterials while grindingblending each lid has rubber gaskets this gives a completely leak proof experience while grindingblending these gaskets are very easy to remove and attach all jars have fibre clasps to close the jars in the blender jar a juicer attachment has been provided this is the only thing i have not used hence i cannot review the performance of this attachment blender can be used without the juicer sieve and works fine in wet blender a flowbreaker is providedsoundsound is high but that is to be expected in a powerful watt machinedos donti feel if we follow certain guidelines we can best out of the product do not overload do not use for more than a minute without giving a little rest when turning the speed knobs dont turn all at once from to max you will see that it works better if you turn knobs slowly staying at each speed for a few seconds actually for most things low to medium speed is enough the machine is really powerful when grinding large amount of ingredients the jar can heat up not the machine so give a little rest in between for wet grinding use cold water to grind that way the jar will never heat up do not grind hot ingredients many people have complained about the rubber gaskets melting that can only have happened if hot food are being blended or ground bring food to room temp and then grind wash the jar gasket jars immediately using a sponge and liquid detergent so that the shine of the jar remains intact always remove and wash the gasket to avoid unhygienic conditions as food can get under the gaskets in the wet blender remove the flow breaker by sliding it off and wash it separately as food particles can get stuck behind it to remove fine particles when dry grinding dont use a spoon to avoid scratches to the jar you can use your hand and a brush used for this purpose only this is an expensive piece of equipment in my house only i my husband use it we do not allow children or household helpcooks to use it this way the machine will not be misused if you mixer does not work please check the overload protector button on the underside of the machine remove some of the ingredients and try again take care while handling jar lids and lid tops although they appear quite well made i cannot say if they will break when droppedpros the machine is very powerful and delivers what it promises it is easy to use and gives truly hands free experience easy to clean grinds and blends everything leakproof lids takes very little time to grind the motor does not heat up even easily the overload protector works perfectlycons guarantee manual the manual has to be downloaded from the amazon websitethe amazon payment is the guarantee there is no separate guarantee card provided i had to call amazon to understand the situation regarding the guarantee card delivery the mixergrinder came in a box but there was no special styrofoam padding this was a big minus for me a couple of extra lid clasps should be provided one of my lid clasps was loose it is working fine at the moment but as a backup company should provide these as the jars are pretty large for smaller amount of products it is a little difficult i wish the smallest chutney jar was usable for both dry wet grinding rather than only wet the jars do have screws heads on the inner side but this is not a big deal and can be cleaned quite easilyreview after using for few monthspros the lock feature is really good for hands free usage grinds very fast say half cup soaked urud dal can be ground to paste in less than minutes juicer is good extraction is good for the juicy fruits good design and takes less space in kitchencons noise is there for the power it grinds but anyway not that high as mentioned in some reviews which i read before my purchasesteel jars get heated up quickly so i used to refrigerate the soaked rice or dals to balance the heatjust need to be careful while cleaning as there are some sharp edges which could hurt a littlewet grinding jartips clean the jars immediately after use to make the cleaning easy with sponge so that jars wont loose its shine i bought this bosch mixer on and the motor is not working i have to buy another mixer what is the use of putting such a big amount in itit worked only for yearsit was only for household purpose i purchasedvery much disappointed with a brandshowed to their mechanical he said motor is burnt from inside true to its name the bosch mixer grinder is a great machine to have in your kitchen however the locks of the cap have given away and cleaning it is a challengenathis is a very good product overall the dosaidli and other such batters come out excellent the motor is powerful and can handle any mixing and grinding needsthe only unsatisfactory thing about this is the juicer it works well with slightly watery fruits like citrus oranges watermelon etc but the moment it comes to fruits and vegetables with a lower water content the juicer fails at extracting anything the juicer is basically another blender jar with a mesh attachment to sieve out the pulp there is no option of being able to push the fruits closer to the blender blade which makes it difficult to crush themall in all an excellent product as long as you stick to the citrus juicesi was a happy customer of sujata for the past years and bosch was a a good optiongood design powerfull motor worth for the price i bought in offer it has a powerful motor does grinding pretty fast compact size lid lock clip very useful priced high juicer function is not much useful
4,just received as of now looks good in this price range will use it for few months and update the reviewbatteries has leaked inside the packing had to put new oneswonderful scale means great look good accuracy very lightweight and skinny and easy to store and very easy to cleanso far so good butthe durable stainless steel construction is just a half true promise only the top plate is obviously some metal but the body is also obviously plasticwould not even mind about this little deviation between promise and reality we all know how marketing messages have to be read but the durable stainless steel top plate fell apart from the remaining plastic part of the machine after not even months of use seems it was simply somehow glued on top with glue strips and the glue doesnt work anymore due to whatever reason didnt remove it it just fell apart during vertical storage just so after only months of use weighting still works when i press the metal plate correctly back on top but as soon as i store it the plate separates itself again from the other part assembling that thing again and again for every single use is a pain ita and not what i expectedthats why i give finally another brand a chance after i complete my review this time no more durable stainless steel construction wanted let me try a different construction which is even some hundreds of bucks cheaper than this thing here both prices reduced today if it keeps months without breaking its a good deal compared to this one isnt itplasticthe product i received is good just started using it will update in the future about its pros and conseasy to usegood productit is referred to me by my friend who is using it for months and he is very much sure about the accuracy of this and then he reffered to me very value for money

3,seller cloudtail india private limitedprice price can drop as low as delivery one day prime bangalorepackage big carton box with air pack no damagerecommended yesreturnable yesroom heaters which one do you needbefore my review i will let you know which one should you buy an oil heater is best that you can buy but that is worth spending for places where the weather will be colder for more than months and well below deg for normal winter uses i recommend buying convection type heaters with fan and thermostat please avoid conduction based ones they can consume less power cheap but they are very slow plus burns oxygen also note whichever you buy make sure it has a thermostat settingproduct reviewthis product from usha is a convection type room heater and i have listed the below features and information twin blade fan thermostat builtin like ac will turn onoff as per temp changes ww operation w means faster heating fan only mode for normal table fan type cant adjust speed onoff power led when it operates fan noise is high and a bit annoying if your room is very calm a power plug and m cord length retracting stand to elevate height about inches year warranty for the productthe room heater uses a powerful fan to spread the heat no swing option very directional you must position it correctly and securely the thermostat option is good to have and i suggest buyers to buy with thermostat as this will help reduce your eb bills as well as give comfortable weather inside the thermostat is not very accurate like in air conditioners but works the user manual gives clear information about using ithow to set up power on select ww the switch is not easy to operate set to thermostat switch to max anticlockwise let the heater run till you feel comfortable warm inside reduce the thermostat slowly till the point where the unit turns off leave that setting undisturbed and let the heater on till morning note if you have mistakenly set it wrongly turnoff and turnon once again follow the same step abovei use this for my sleeping room which is about x size in bangalore it is about deg at night and can drop low in another few weeks and it took about minutes to bring it deg with w in almost closed room please note if your place has a room temperature not outside temp well below and it not exposed to sunlight then it will take a long time to reach comfortable temperature in such cases only use w setting it does not burn oxygen but reduces relative humidity which can cause dryness so keeping a bucket or a better a tray of water will help but you must keep your window slightly open never use it on a closed rooma or ai see this as a main problem as in many of our houses we only have a for washing machines and ac socket which is not easily reachable this unit can only be plugged into a socket the reason is when you operate a v unit with a socket you can only draw a maximum of watts v x a from that socket however since this unit operates also at w it requires a as that could only provide up to w v x a like acs etc however you can safely use this unit from a normal a socket only if you are using at w always just buy a a to a converter socket and use this do not worry it will work just fine but never use w though if you house has mcb tripper then its much safetips always keep some space from all sides of the heater unit first try with fan unit for minutes before using for heater using after a long storage keep a window slightly open for fresh air air can feel dry after sometime can cause nose irritation and dryness room must be ventilated adding water tray can helpdrawbacks fan noise sometimes unbearable in a calm room average build quality and finishingfinal wordsi recommend this product a cheap and effective unit for a small to medium size rooms and it does not burn oxygen but makes dry air which can easily be overcome the prices could drop around sometimes so please check price before buying thanks for reading this if you have any doubts comment belowon first day i had faced some minor problem in this product but day after that day till now it working with no minor and major issues i am happy on this product good purchased this usha t heater which got delivered to me on th dec we use it moderately for just hrs in dayit was working fine for days howeveron th day ie on jan night after around half an hour of running it suddenly started making khadkhadkhad sound and all its coil were red hot since we were awake i just switched off the power from main switch it could have resulted into burning or fire if i would have delayed for few more secondswhen i picked up the heater in hand it looked some part was loosened insidethen on the next day on th jan i lodged a complaint with usha customer care na di was told the technician will visit within hrs however no one came in hrs so i called up the technician on the number shared to me by usha on th after that technician visited me upon checking he found that out of fans one fan has loosened completely and fallen inside that is why it was making sound and coils were getting too much heatedi was relaxed that its not a big problem and would be fixed quickly but to my surprise the plastic coupler to which the fan was screwed is not able to hold the screw tightly there was a problem with the coupler what kind of quality it is that within few days of usage screw automatically loosenrd and coupler not able to hold it anymoreadding to my surprise the technician was not having the new coupler for replacement he said he will check tomorrow and come back of part is available but he didnt came back when i called next day he said part is not available and has informed the company but cant say when it will be availableso i called usha customer care again and they said yes techinician has reported part is not available na dwe are forwarding your request to service team to arrange the part asapsince then i have been calling usha customer care as well techinician everyday and both are throwing the ball on each otherusha customer care is worst saying everytime that they are forwarding the request to concerned department and as soon as the part is available it will be replaced i asked them how many days it may take as i cant keep on waiting for a month they just said they cant say when it would be availablesince it is too cold nowadays and heater is not working what is the use of purchasing this usha heaterif they will replace it after a month winter would have already passed by thenthis is a worst after sale service from big brand like usha and it was not expected from usha if they dont have the basic parts available with the service center what is the use of sending technician empty handedfrom now on i will never recommend usha to anyone and if any usha representative is reading this post i request to them to service my heater asapthanksgo ahead the cord is very short and required amp plug point it eats up available oxygen in closed roomusing since one year found fit for house use
4,the mixier is very asthetically designed and performs well i am very much satisfied and would definitely recommend this machine to all potential buyersusabilityi liked this product but one thing is that there is no light indicater of electricity onoff soits little bit confusing that wheather its on or offgood productthe package was not done with amazon packaging but like a gunny bag type pack not expected very poorly haphazard packing will any body look into thiskeep in mind it makes quite noticeable amount of noise and after using it for more than years one of the utensils rotor broke and start making more noise other than that a good purchase and good modern designgoodlid of small jug very loose
4,good productit looks decent has decent space and serves the overall purposegood products size could be little biggood in qualityits about knee length height the ring at the top is broken inside the loop otherwise it is very good need to check for durabilityhandle material is so much good the stritching is not tight in some sides it will get loose in few weeks if u buy u have to once again make stritching then the durability is longergoodthe bag is worth the costing however the picture gets a little misleading as its not as sturdy as shown in the pictures the capacity is also not much a very handy bet in case if we are trying to get something in pocket friendly price

3,ikea sales this product for only its not worth more than that quality is not top notch at first i thought orginal product was replaced with first copy but after doing some research got to know it was orginal product costing only directly from ikea seller i guess buys from ikea and sale here coz the mrp tag was removedi have tried many frothers but this is the best one so far since i finally found one where the steel rod does not fall offthey should have given one set of battery with the item these batteries are not easily available and my frother is lying useless in my kitchenbad product brokenthe product suddenly stopped working completely today after about months the speed had deteriorated after one month of usei use this product sparingly about once every few days for frothing three four cups of coffee hence there is no reason for this to malfunction there is also no recourse available to meaverage qualitythis product is not powerful enough
4,value for moneyno likes no dislikesvalue for moneyplug needed am adaptorthe element is heating too much need to shut down each time the product is beautiful designed but quality wise crompton greaves has comprisedthe basic feature of any heat convector is element if it is getting heat up then its broke downits to good value for moneyplug is too large for this type of plug you have should have amp socket board

3,i usually dont write review but this product is amazing everyone should give it a try u will not disappoint after buyingno words to say amazing you can see the picture i hv shared
4,the main concern is power cord length it is too small overall finish is good functionally it is ok thick piece of bread can be toastedgoodthe only reason i bought this product is its country of origin is india as compared to its competitors but they have mentioned it wrong in the description im not complaining the product but they should have mentioned correct informationbookbrowning settings are done very well rating has been given for this price point well worth the pricenice product easy n safenice performance have used of them cleaning up is difficult thoughtoasting up to mark
4,hi i used this fin heater in a x feet room with roof hight at ftit tood hr minutes to raise temperature by degree from to room was closedi retirmed it bought blackdecker fin which is too fast and surpass this bajaj finbajaj name in itself a guarantee of excellence a very product heats up the house in no time like a boon to elderly people like usthis is my review after days of usage firstly i feel i got a used product as the packing was already unpacked inside the box and normally with a brand new unused oil heater on first usage you get a smell as the oil and fins heat up for first time this did not happen for me anyways i just thought to see if all is good and hope it performsthe heater has very very slow heating you need to run it at max thermostat and with full load or w and even then it will take very long to feel the warmth i was able to touch the fins for a second even after operating it for more than an hour without cutting off thermostat cut off works but quite below max and then it wont heat up as it gets cut off and onfor such type of heater the room should have just one entry and that should not keep opening often if you have doors opening every now and then it will not keep room warmover all for the price it has i didnt feel like its worth to operate it when it has so slow heatingthis clearly is one of the best oil heater out there at a very good price in offline i was getting fin model for k to k but here at amazon i got it at rs this is very silent and heats up the room in to minreally worth for the money spent easy to use and can be moved to other rooms without any difficulty the performance is goodthe product is good but the desired product was not deliveredi am happy with my decision to buy this heater room gets warm and comfy the radiator works very well even in the cold kullu weather has heat settings and when youve turned it on for a while you can turn the heat settings off and the fan will still blow warm air very effective and doesnt give you headache like the rod heaters do has auto cutoff as well
4,i like this value for money compared to other company overall is good productgood product that is value for moneynot that high speed as shown in videos not satisfy with the speed over all its easy to use easy to installthe product mechanism is like any other exhaust fan in the market i realized that the size of the exhaust fan doesnt really have a noticeable impact on suction power of airnonetheless its drawbacks are that because of the small space between the fan blades it is ultimately impossible to clean any dustoil buildups on the inside rods and the shutter walls the only way to clean the aforementioned areas is from the posterior side of the exhaust fan which is difficult to reach in most housing situationsokgood quality and works as per my requirement not that great
3,the product really looks good and classy unless it was not damagedthe kettle looks sleek but there seem to be some design defects the base and the bottle dont seem to fit exactly so that the entire contraction wobbles about when the water starts boiling then while pouring hot steam which enters the handle thru the steam sensor hole makes the handle too hot i had to tape the handle to insulate my hand from the hot handle the switch doesnt fit the slot on the handle perfectly and i also noticed some water drops condensing on the inside of the switch on the handlei used a prestige kettle earlier which had much better workmanship but these are all made in china anyway i have nothing against china here with the wipro kettle there seems to have been a bad lot which possibly explains why the price is lower than that of other models offered by wiprothis is a problem with shopping on amazon that one gets sucked into price comparisons and going for the cheaper option which are mostly defective products without any disclaimer in this case i consciously went for this option on the hope that it would not be a serious defect lets see if my hope is allayedits too good and using it formore than months nownice product to use as simple as the product is good but it makes too much noise while heatingits an ok product but price is little high same things same features u will gey on some brands at cheaper price lets see how long ittill now working perfectly
4,coffee filter is just the right size for a small family it has a good finish and is easy to wash and cleanthe size is compact good for making a strong filtered coffee for pax what else do you expect just go for ituse it everyday no complaintseasy to use and maintainclean size could have been bigger overall good for one personyou can get it for less price than this in a retail shop or even in big bazaarits compact easy to use and makes a great cup of coffeegood coffee filtersimple product works well the filter holes could have been smaller decoction goes down in a minute and does not get the strength probably i should go to a grinder and ask for coarse grinding of the coffee beans
4,it is okay so farthis product was amazing and easy to usehave used this previouslyrepeat orderdifferent sizes make it use for various pantry itemsgood its usefuli like this products for a long time when we were in london good quality productsa life saver when you run out of containers not too sturdy like the one you get in miniso but not bad eitherquality is pretty good at an affordable pricethese are good solid and sturdy clips the clips are in sizes quite big and can easily clip big packets but the other are half the size and somewhat small it would have been good to include some medium sized clips which i find most useful neither too big nor too small but overall good quality and sturdy hence stars
4,the battery was not fittingthis time the filters have some change in design and filter the water faster i dont understand why amazon sent it with direct item pack instead of packinggood regular and useful productthe product quality is going down day by daygoodproduct packing is not at all professional its not all expected from a reputed brand like hulnicenot good product

3,it is big to travelling purpose other wise it is goodif you travelling out side with your baby then it will best option for you to take it and use it for hot water and khechadialso you can make itili on thisone minor concern is this product is sensitive to water it means if want to cook food without water then it will torn off automaticallyfor example if i want cook some fried thing then i should use oil first then at that moment it will not work because you used oilso you cannot fry anything on itonly you can do using water everything that can be done by using that be done using itso keep this thing on your mind while purchasing this itemapart form this everything works greatउपरकतit is good for small family and easy to cleanplprovide at least meier cord for immediate use and mak eplace for movement cordsize is very smalli think its a good producti had to return it because off size its very small and i doubt its useful for rice cooking its good for steaming and boilingnot wasy to use and quality of moulds etc is really badcomplicated process of how much water to fillno clear instructions on cooking
4,i have been using this for about six months now it is quite handy and is able to make pretty good fruit shakes and smoothies i add a couple of ice cubes and it manages to crush them but needs more than one cycle battery life is acceptable i charge after every uses the motor runs at full all the time i thought that i would be able to tell when the battery gets low but no it will simply stop at the last second with no way to tell if it is getting low initially i wondered if the exposed charging port would lead to any problems or not but i have been careful with it and have had no issuesi find it to be a great and useful product for one person get a proper nonportable blender if you want to use it for blending hard dry substances or for multiple peopleeasy to usebest blender used so fargreat product very compact and easy to carry cant blend hard items but works for soft fruit smoothies or milkshakes we liked this productbuild is solid and the motor is powerful enough for its purpose it would have been perfect if the charging port was not exposedgood onesatisfiedi am using this product since weeksit is good upto now i am using this for only milk shake with banana onlyits blending is good
4,good product for basic dry ironing and a must have for every household temperature ccontrol is not that great and could have been a knob instead of a circular disc that everyone makes innovation overall i would recommend thsi product as it does all your basic dry ironing and better than philips i bogutht sometime back that has a sharp steel edge that kind of rips soft clothes i recommend ushai had previously purchased on it was running fine from last years and i got job in a different place do i have ordered again worth for moneyworth for moneygood product in this price range however i recevied a bit damaged product at the handle throug i fixed it using itvery good productits amazing product in this price rangequality is good also look goodeasy to use and overall good productgoodproduct is not heating aa per expectations and therefore not ironing well
4,good producteverything is okay but its increasing heat at workingwhat i observe in few days to use with this kent hand blender that is very sleek design and well built with steel body and there is some issues with this it is become very hot in minute of continuous run that hot u cant even touch that and there push button you have to continuous press button to runeasy to handle and comparatively nice blender then othersdecent pricebest kent producteasy to cleanhaving been using this for months working as per standard and it is easy to clean but getting over heared if we use for more than min and the cooling time is moreseller should check the item before shipping it will reduce the negetive feedback and also return shipping extra charge will b reduced to themno one is going to take defective product

4,once you start using a bagless vacuum cleaner you will never turn back using it on a weekly basis since nov so its a long tern review coming from another vacuum cleaner that had bags this one is truly a hasslefree cleaner at least you are away from the hassle of maintainingcleaningreplacing bags which is truly a mess and you would understand only if you have used cleaners with bags further devices with bags tend to get chocked now and then leading to less suction inside box vacuum cleaner unit flexible pipe with integrated retraceable brush and suction adjustment knob turbo brush nozzle multiclean nozzle high suction flat inlet nozzle telescopic extension pipe user manual warranty cardthe power cord is mtr and device comes with a mechanish to retrace it back into the machine it has normal amp pin top which can easily fit in or pin sockets both amp or amp but better to connect it to amp ones only considering its power consumption observations pros device has high suction power and can be cleaned easily with a bagless design where dust collects in a chamber and you can empty it in the dustbinno hassles of cleaning and replacing bags components are high quality such as the telescopic extension is metallic though its also a con for this attachment even plastic components are of good quality device easily moves around owing to its big and smooth wheels you dont need to pull it by force default flexible pipe itself is long and has an integrated brush that can also be retracted its a highly useful attachment considering its attached to a primary flexible pipe and is easily available for use each attachment here is multipurpose when you open the package you feel like very few attachments are provided but when you start exploring you discover that all attachments are multipurpose details below attachments are easy snap fit and remove activelock in the companys terminology once you insert the attachments it click locks and can be removed by a press of a button or release lever both the turbo brush and multinozzle have flexible neck and wheels on the bottom for easy movement and effective cleaning dust collector can be opened with one press and has removable filters attached to it these filters can be washed once in a while to prevent clogging the main unit has h filter system to filter fine dust dust mites etc and is equivalent to hepa as per the company this filter is accessible from the backside for cleaning purposes device obviously makes sound but is not in the range of causing irritation to the ears its in the bearable range observations cons telescopic extension is metallic and heavy so its a bit of trouble to use for longer durations especially when you are trying to clean ceilings reduction of suction power is via a bypass valve built into the flexible pipe and has no way to reduce the power of the machine to reduce suction so effectively this valve makes cleaner suck in air from in between to reduce suction at the end but then consumes the same amount of power if there had been a control mechanism to reduce power it would also save electricity device comes with a amp top but its pin so if you are going to use it with modular power sockets with self closing mechanism for holes it will be a trouble to plug it in everytime i miss the blower system in this cleaner which is handy at times was there in my previous cleaner they could have easily implemented itfor the cons reducing star but its definitely a star device attachments flexbile pipe comes with an integrated brush and you can easily retract it back onto the pipe multipurpose nozzle has a button to increase its suction power and with one press it goes nearer to the floor turbo brush nozzle sweeps the floor or mattress with rotating bristles along the length and if you want to turn off the rotation of the brush there is a button to lock it main unit has a system on the back and botton side to attach the multiclean and turbo brush nozzle primarily for easy sweep or for storage purposes final verdictthis bagless vacuum cleaner is a hasslefree device and requires very less maintenance but it comes at a cost and if you are willing to stretch your budget its definitely worth it i have had no any issues so far in the past year when using it regularlythis is a nice bag less vaccum cleaner with a rotating brush that does a great job of cleaning it also comes with good set of accessories i found it also cheaper to order it online compared to the croma store two drawbacks not a deal breaker i found and i hope philips addresses them were it comes with a two pin ampere plug and you need to buy an adapter to use with normal ampere plugs in the house i was afraid to use the adapter thinking that it may heat with the use but had no issues with heating of the adapter or the plugs in the wall during minutes of cleaning each room in the house i do not see a point in having that plug during the use one just pulls it along but it has no handle to lift the machine i believe that one can use the handle of the dust canister to lift the machine but i am afraid that repeated lifting like this will break the clickon mechanism so ended up lifting the machine as a whole all the time while moving the machine without the hoseas i mentioned earlier these are not deal breaker but enough to take one star off and can have the star back if philips addresses the issues on this great little machinesuction power is good suitable for cleaning carpet window curtains floors and carpetscleaning the dust container is also very easy only concern i have is if some length power cord is not pulled out from machine the power wire that still reamins inside the machine is getting heat from suction motor after using the machine for nearly hour and i pulled out the cord that was in the machine it was actually liitle hot to touch not sure is it safe for the live power cord to warm up like this would have been even better if this had blower functionality alsogood productcord length and suction power is satisfactorygood quality heavy noisethis is the first vacuum cleaner purchase for me and i can say that i am a happy customer i bought this back in august and it is serving me well it comes with attachments that are convenient and reach high places it has three modes of cleaning tiled floors carpets and sofas and with pets in the house it has made my life that much easier thank you phillips for a good product and thank you amazon for a smooth transactionwellbuilt topnotch quality suction power is too high
4,lead should be strongi had a fantastic first day experience with this product and because of the wire it works so quickly i plan to use it more oftenits an excellent product at this price does what it promises to do the best thing about it is that its made in india and runs on electricity and not batteries i immediately tried it on two lowers that had lot of peeling on them it cleaned them in no time and made them new again i would recommend it for every householduse full to remove linta very useful and affordable purchase makes the cloth as new after using it easy to use and does what it claims worth the purchasethe product works well and does the work it promises build quality looks good too and it is easy to useit is easy to use

4,item is good but bottom lid should have provided along with the itemonce after blending juice or protein shakes we can use the top bottle directly as a sipper but without bottom lid we cant close the juice bottle and the liquid will be spoiled if not drank within minsi request seller to provide bottom lid to close the bottle even low cost blenders in market are providingelse the product is okgood and compact good for travelersto prepare the juice blends dry fruits withfor me its very helpful as i carry it while i travelextremely handyvery good for smoothiesprice on the higher side thoughgood for travelling with babies or kidsits good although it did give some start issue its just that fruit veggies pieces should be small bought with too much expectations and found out ml to be too low for blending a shake with one full apple gm oats milks and gm nuts it struggles to start and we need to turn it upside down to give the blade some momentum and then it starts blendingfor someone who is going to carry it is your best bet but for stationary heavy blending buy something else with direct power source
4,pros most affordable option year warrantycons no inlet and outlet pipes are given you can purchase that offline or i found one pair on amazon for inr it doesnt come with any installation service or manualan installation from urban company will cost around taxes which is about inrhowever after product delivery lifelong sent me a whatsapp message asking about installation they charge for technician and for pipesso the cost is better by lifelong support because within you get technician and the pipeshence choose to go with lifelong servicei am writing this review after using the product for months it is working amazingly the company doesnt provide installation support you need to self install it at the end it is value for money go for itthe company should provide technician for installation and conneting pipe should also be provided by companyoverall easy to set up look of the geyser are premium with well insulated coverproduct is good i was using this item from years then again i brought more for new bathroom i very happy with this product fully satisfied with yearsworking well worth buyingworth for the moneygood product value for money but accessories missinggood product in price range but power consumption is high if this is ok go ahead

4,i am pleased with my purchase the installation process is easy and the product is very reliable the level safety feature ensures that the water heater is safe to use and prevents accidental scalding the water heater heats the water quickly and the temperature can be adjusted to suit my needs the only problem i am facing is with the indicator ideally the red light shows that the water is getting heated and it turns off when the water is heated enough but in my unit its vice versa the green indicator is working as red and the red indicator is greenit is worth buying it works wellfirst of all packaging was poorsecondly crompton says it is good for family of members bath bucket but for that waiting is too longgo for higher rated geyser from cromptoninstallation is not hard instruction book is given only lacking point is warranty card is sign n seal warranty card is valuelessworks just fine but i must say it is useful more for kitchen purpose and in bathroom if u dont use shower cuz after running for a couple of seconds the temp of the water drops heating is not that effective being instant if anyone wants to take hot shower must go of geysers with larger storage capacitythe packaging was good and intact no connecting pipes were inside the power cable was very short that made things bit difficult i bought a m lengthy connecting hose for cold and hot water supply i installed it myself and registered online on crompton site if you have drill machine or if you can borrow it it just takes two holes to complete the installation working well and makes hot water in minsdo not connect using any extension box unless it is rated for w otherwise the wires will melt better always try to connect directly with the socketvery useful product

4,i bought it for dont think that because this is cheap it will be a poor quality product these clips serve the purpose perfectly i fail to understand what can be improved by paying more for other similar clipssecond qualityin this photo you can see my old ones on left after one year of use still shinythese are on right side in comparison colour is very dull probably due to recycled material still very useful product worth the price paidthe clips are okay colour is a bit dull compared to the picture given material is okay but its serving its purpose can buy itconvenientcheap plastic but worth the price does what it saysgood qualitydoubting on its sturdiness average product
4,for this price range product design look spec and features provided is good it would be great if havells pay attention in packing as the product box i received first had manufacturing defects and mising parts flexible pipes after placing a replace request with amazon received other box which also had some minor scratches in the heater body and also found fastners were missing in the boxgood product at this price heating is also very good the major cons of this brand is installation problem the installation workers never come for installation at your home so you can arrange installation workers otherwise every things is goodhavells should send trained technician for installation the technician was asking for additional rs charge for installing a tap of rs and labour charge which i personally did it very disgusting guy havells to look inti the matter technician do not have proper tools with him and he asks from all tools from customer including nails pliers hammer etcthis geyser is worth to the money product as it only takes max of minutes to make iced water very hot as well as the indicator of the product is very good as it can be be clearly seen by low vision persion due to its size and colour deptness and also makes the look of geyser very goodoverall a good water heater deducted star as the circular piece covering the light keeps coming off did not replace as it did not impact the function of the water heatervalue for money good installation service attractive and suits for my bathroomits a good product and value for moneygood product at this price

4,used it to keep the air inside as clean as possible this model does provide clean air over a reasonable sized space if the windows and doors are kept closedgreat product with a capability to reduce dust by approximately eg if atmosphere pm is ppm it will be reduced to upto ppm inside room only if minimum ventilation is provided to take care the co we generatein my case i have found in my area that the ambient has co at ppm if we open one window door to only by mm clearnce the co is being maintained from to ppm with adults inside the room based on wind velocity and direction this adjustment mm clearance was achieved measuring with calibrated stand alone co cum pm measurement meterone more example with above ventilation arrangement the machine is in auto and ambient air pm at ppm room also at ppm the fan speed reached medium sound audible it took some time to reach ppm and then it took min from ppm to ppm now fan speed changed to low speed in auto sound is inaudible this ppm starts increasing gradually to ppm in minutes now fan speed increases to medium again and the cycle repeats as long as outside pm is ppmsimilarly the fan speed so its sound can be very high if ambient pollution is very highit needs external cleaning of its hepa filter every month based on pollution the sensor may need cleaning every months for accurate readings if sensor mal functions it is to be cleaned first and check before taking to any service centerit has a simple filter element with spare availability and capable to give atleast times the specified life if we clean the hepa filter element externally with vacuum cleaner regularlyit does not have ozone producing uv rays or ion generators which if not properly designed specified to customes not worry may pollute the air with ozoneit has particulate count pm meter which is very accurate in addition it change display colour according to pollution zones to know the condition of air in the room the readings were authenticated with above calibrated stand alone meter co pm pm and pmwe have to keep it on auto to facilitate to change flow speed based on pollution level itstemperature and humidity meters are also usefulupdate still under warranty it developed some abnormal sound just audible when we go near to it like kitch kitch kitch at lowest speed doubt was on loosening of bottom locknut of fan and sound is ruled out from fan bearings this diagnosis also strengthened by the observation that the above sound disappeared when it is made upside downbottom cover opened side covers opened the bottom grill was moved down by lifting lock with columns and it was found that the button lock nut was in slightly loose condition as anticipated the abnormal sound and mild vibration problems are resolved after tightening the nut with mm tubular spanner already available with me holding the fan nut is a self locking type and assembled back but opening of side covers is a tricky and risky job some locks may be broken use hand gloves to protect hands from sharp edges they may open in jerky motion i have made some top grill locks bottom side open by cutting modification so that i can open the panels easily in future however another mi air purifier s is working almost continuously without any problem from last yearsupdate high abnormal sound observed this time i want send it to service center but while lifting some material flied off from grill so when i run it upside down many foreign material came out like some bodies of flying ants their wings and one baby lizard now again it is working normalactualy ther is no need of any smart features for an air filter in practicality we just plug and use it yes air quality is improving but it does not reduce any allergic issuesreally liked the product i like how it shows the current aqi has a auto mode night mode that is super helpful with a babythe air purifier is is quiet filters well and quickly will wait and watch for long term reliability plus the replacement filters are expensivebut the seller shipped an item in an open box turned out to be a used product filter says remaining meaning it had been used to a good extent earlier not sure why second hand items are sold as newworks well since months more comments will be updated sooneri like because the performance is good and effective very easy to installit works well but pollution level indicator is not reliable and keeps changing number very quickly in vide range so in night you cant use night mode
4,everything was good just issue i found with the rubber which is used to tighten this but i replaced that with my old one rest all goodits slightly leaking from the side after installationits bottom should firmly stick to the surface and seal properlywhat is the logic of tape sealing the top flap when the cartridge can be taken out and replaced back through the unsealed bottom flap of the product carton in contrast the carton of the pure it cartridge is sealed both at the top and the bottomtata swach should correct this anomaly star likeneed to change frequentlygood qualitygood quality product

4,nicethis fan is working fine ive been using it since month the thing which bajaj can improve is the noise level of both motor and while cutting the airdesign of blades but considering the price its a perfect deal comes up with nice looking design and qualitylow cost but does the jobnicegoodrecently purchased for extra room actual performance will can be measured in summer onlyrpm is less bajaj quality is not maintained bearing sound in the initial start and low speed the trust in bajaj has come down after this purchase the bajaj fan purchased in is still working with out any complaint just i changed the capacitor for rs the price is competitivevalue for money better at this rate
3,like this productthe product is good my only complaint is regarding the cellsalong with the machine the cell were sent separately which were of no usei had to purchase them separatelywhen i bought it worked really well light weight and portable makes it convenient to use initially it was a great product not sure what happened after few months it was difficult to tare when i switch on and display shows zero immediately after it start moving to minus and takes long time to tare back to zero which makes it annoying and inconvenient also not sure about its accuracy seeing this instability to taregood product for kitchen itemaccurate and easy to carry loved itgreat same day delivery of item received just nowalso very user friendly no issues in usage with batteries included all inside thatgood enoughgood quality thanks
4,good and easy to usevery goodgoodoverall a good product to buy just not understanding what temperature is best sometimes it burns the bread at sometimes gives the best roast and sometimes it doesnt roast the whole bread so a little confused with thatits a simple device functions as it should setting the temperature and cleaning are easydo not forget to preheat every time the toaster is put to use thereafter adjust the control as needed for soft toast or for crisp roasted toastthe quality of baking toast is amazingnyc
4,lights inbuilt in this create psychological effect as they changed according to the quality of air but apart of that no visible change i have witnessed yetbought it after reading a lot of reviews it is boxy in shape but a no nonsense and powerful air purifier easy to assemble easy to clean and good air flow the silent mode will be more than sufficient if it is pm that youre trying to get rid of the purifier is so effective that it draws out moisture also so do not be surprised if you feel a dry throat in the morning i run it for a few hours in silent mode and then switch it off to avoid the dehumidifier effect worth the price and great customer servicei am extremely happy with this purchasethe purifier is very sensitive to impure air and makes sure to trigger purification of highest level to bring the aqi down under good qualitythe hepa filter has longer life than most other products also the aqi indicator is through at led indicator that is more accurate than the digital interface which comes with other productsthe installation and functioning is extremely simple and can be done in minutesthe best part is the support you receive from coway the day the delivery from amazon was supposed to happen i got a call from support executive intending to help with installation and related things a follow up call was also made to describe morethe product comes with yr warranty and additional two years was provided upon registrationmy flatmate also purchased the same after seeing mine functioninggoodonly drawback i found is that it does not show any reading for the pollution level after turning it on in auto mode it turns from red to orange and then to green within mins but showing the pollution level along would have been more convincingi wanted a no nonsense machine for the childrens bedroom to control and allergies and dust especially during the winter smog season here in lucknow my kids are happy with the machine since it is very easy to use and i am happy since it seems quite easy to maintain as compared to the other brands models rajnish gave a nice quick demo of how to use it and maintain the device and also how to register for the yr warranty for now i am quite satisfied with the service and the producti got this product as second purifier in home amazed to see the performance with simplistic looks and no jaziness works well i think two things can be enhanced provide a handle to move the product around and color optionrest all no complaintsfor testing i opened the windows and then ran this purifier and in the same room i kept my dyson to monitor aqi level within mins it brought down the aqi level in room which was monitored by dysonhappy with the quality and highly recommended

3,firstly i got the cracked jar but the product replaced the very next day i like the new and compact design of the product easy to clean and assemble and the powerful motor with no speed option chopper choped and blender blend wonderfullythings i dislikes the most is the noise its fully plastic materialthe only thing which is not a plastic to open eye is the blades only and the juice extractor which isnt a juice extractor actuallyi always wanted a juicer and then i found this it works like a magic so easy and so quick the blender is also good i using it almost every day for my juice and milkshakes the major problem with this is that it doesnt have a regulator and also no on and off switch thats the major drawback over all i liked it no other issues good productthe product is so goodbut i got cracke in chopper jar after using just two or three timeso let me know can i exchange it only chopper jarthe product build quality good using the product is very easy and after use cleaning is very easy too build quality is good and jars are nice the first impression of the product is its very sleek and easy to use and handleits very much good for spices and chutneymasala specially dry masala grinding was very good its juice making skill was so so niceits very easy to cleani bought this mixer grinder and juice blender combo it is very handy and effecient in usage grinds all dry and wet material nicely the juicer gives fresh juice and removes all seeds without giving bitter taste crushes ice also well blender makes all kind of shakes and smoothies great for everyday usewe can use easily good product for alli use it inmy daily routine

4,good mixer under noise level is slightly high but quite efficientproduct is ultimate supermixer quality was very nice bt juicers jar not up to the markvery noisy but works fine would have loved if it had extra bowl for that extra blade hectic to change blade into another bowl for using the extra blade suggestion one inverted jar would be nice too the juicer has the loose locking system all others have good locking systems some plastic from mesh was cut when using it that needs better alignment overall worth the purchase even with the excess noise also the screw tightener for changing blades broke after changes of blades but that is not big deal it would have been better to have durable nut tightenerrecommend to buy this good quality attachments and powerful watt motor not less than bosh grinder at less pricei had purchased active kw earlier from amazon but the item being imbalanced was returned for replacement the replacement piece received has the same defect which was returned for good then in view of the reviews i went for this item and so far its performance is satisfactory although some of the reviews were discouraging if you want power as well as reasonable rates go for itvery good item
3,product is very handy but the water capacity is too lowdisappointed with the products pricing considering its wattage and usage time you cant iron more than clothes before water refillsince the mouth area is not that much youll need to move it so many times slowly on the whole clothsteam amount is fine but design is such that you cant press it hardly on to the cloth during ironingso overall do keep in mind before buying that its only for emergency travel purpose for dewrinkling already ironed clothesgood product does what it says though the water tank could have been biggerbetter to buy normal iron boxtakes a lot of time and is not very easy to use you will need to use the conventional iron even after using this steamer for most of the clothes works only for the synthetic fabrics its better to stick to the conventional ironhiii the water tank is too small and can only use for one shirt or t shirtso plz concentrate on this alsoabsolutely good easy to handle and flexible movement it took me less than mins to iron kurtiadvice to users please follow the instructions carefully have some patience and it works greatnegative water chamber is very small and it takes full tank to iron shirt kurtithe product is good unfortunately it came withou a manual i had to figure our where the water tank was and use it otherwise the product works wellvery low water storage is what put me off otherwise its just ok does the job but at times need to refill water even for single garment

3,this product is good its only customer support and service that is pathetic if not for that this product would have had real good rating i received a slightly defective piece where indicators where not working i initially raised an issue about it but there was no immediate support for that as filter was working fine and we didnt require indicators we didnt bother to follow up after several days the service guy came and fixed it first time when the service guy came there was no one so he came again and got it fixed for immediate support its better to reach out to local authorised dealer or service as going through the official support delays the process so considering all these i feel product is decentfree services are limited if we change the filter during the free services we will be charged filter is not free of charge during the free servicesproduct is good but the service is worst till i experienced if your staying in rural areas and your planing to buy this than i will say dont prefer because i have called minimum times to the custer care they always saying that they will send the service person but even no one is calling you to response if your product is in service period the service person even dont lift your call and say the answer once the lady has called me and asked some details after she say it is not come under there area and she will forward it after i think five days has been completed and i called her back she replied rudely and saying i told you this is not come under there area and i asked her atleast give me my area service person number she gave me atlast and i called the service person and he replied he didnt recieve any complaint id so raise a complaint on service request then he will come i am frustrated and take my product and went to guntur to repair it previously i done a service with the company servicemen he put a cap on the nozzle of the water pump so it stopped working and it all damaged they told me you have to replace the pump it cost around i have changed it and decided not to call the service person and write a review on amazon so the people will know about the service centreinstallation guy didnt install propery due to which water was not being purified for last one month poor service from eureka forbesmost value for price from aquaguardgoodoktap leakage issue

4,here is a try at a review of this product after using it for an year nowuse case i am a ncr resident and the air pollution is as we know one of the worst possible if not the worst i have it installed in the bedroom about sq ft so well within the advertised max room space while using the purifier the room is kept closed to minimize pollution additionbuild quality the purifier is sturdy in its built and aesthetically pleasing it has a large front grill that acts as the air inlet and an arched back that has a larger grill for filtered air outlet the arc helps the air to be released vertically upwards and hence does not add to direct cooling for anyone sitting in front this helps the filters use in winter which is the main season where it is required the top of the filter has a dark panel with touch sensitive buttons and a decent sized circular led screen the buttons are power night mode fan speed and child locksetup the air purifier is shipped with its parts packed separately thus on unboxing the same has to be setup for use the setup is pretty straightforward the main filter units front can be released and the individual filters aligned in order on the central space the installation order of the filter is as followsfirst hepa filter the same has indication on top to correct installation you can also go with keeping the phillips branding on the top left cornersecond active carbon filter the same has indication on top to correct installation you can also go with keeping the phillips branding on the top left cornerthird pre filter this one actually clips in place and is used to filter out the larger dust impurities so that it does not clog the other main filtersthus the filtering order is pre filter carbon filter hepa filterworking the air purifier can be set to different modes one of them being the automatic mode that automates the purifier working thanks to the inbuilt air quality sensor the pollution level sensed regulates the fan speed accordingly levels are programmed and are indicated on the small circular led screen by means of circular rings of different colors blue min violet pink red max red level would put the fan in maximum speed and blue would turn off the filter automaticallyif you are not a fan of the automatic mode you can use the fan speed button to move through the option of different fan speedmodes they arefan speed indicated by on the screenfan speed indicated by on the screenfan speed indicated by on the screenautomatic mode indicated by a on the screenallergen mode this can be only added on top of automatic mode it essentially bumps up the speed a bit on all the different color levels this is to suit the sensitive people as this improves the air filtration rateturbo mode indicated by t on the screen this puts the fan in the maximum speed possiblethats pretty much the major functioning of the air purifier additionally the filter has an automaticforced night mode the purifier automatically detects the lighting in the room and once it senses low to no light it automatically goes into night mode the same can be forced by pressing the night mode button the purifier what this does is that if the filter is in automatic mode the fan speed is reduced on all the levels so as to minimize the noisesummary so as to summarize my review and add my view here the filter works pretty well for the use case i have on regular winter pollution days its able to keep the air quality in control even when working in automatic mode its able to go down from red levels to blue switching on an off intermittently as per the air quality levels on drastic pollution days it has a tough time managing the air quality in automatic mode and i have to force it in turbo mode to get the air quality in control if not too much of an air change is happening in the room throughout the filter is able to get the air quality to a much acceptable levelsthe air quality indicator is a great value add on to the product much that is missing in similar priced competitorsi am little disappointed in the night mode working as it compensates air quality over noise i believe the purifiers task is to ensure that the air quality in room is as good as possible by reducing the fan speed to reduce noise works ok on normal pollution days but is totally useless in any thing even a little worse when i dont want to use turbo mode just yetdurability of the filters has been decent i have used it all through the winters last year and intermittently the summer this year but am yet to get an indication to change the hepa or the carbon filter on yes that reminds me the air purifier would automatically sense and indicate when a filter needs to be replaced by displaying an error code on the screen it even does that for the prefilter which does not have to be replaced but just cleanedwashed that i have received times this past yearoverall i still strongly recommend this product good performance with a decent price which has been slashed a good amount from when it launchedgood productthe product does not stand out notably but it probably does the work it is supposed to it is too late now to return this product and try another makeover all good productbeasy to installwell designed product yet to experience filter replacement and consequently the recurring costthe product is working nicely and worth buying productwriting after almost years all pros n cons everything is good only problem is i live in delhi and hepa filter will cost you around and it took only months it become totally black few advice dont run it near kitchen it will catch all carbon n pores will b blocked if you live in delhi check it after every month clean with vaccume cleaners seal your doors most dirt mosquito come from there open windows only that too seal them and put anti dust and mosquito net on them run it all day as when u turn it iff after hour your room will be as dirty as ut was you can clean pre filter only dont clean carbon and hepa filter being and indian if your hepa filter become black get some jot water put some detergent and dip it inside all dust and carbon will come out and use it again haha its paper but its so hard you can wash it times keep it under sun light for hours sometimes u get error of fo clean all three filter with vaccume or brush careful while cleaning with brush that dust is dangerous can cause problems so wear mask after cleaning hold ur finger on child lock to reset and it will start working bhai delhi m pollution bhot h so family k lie monthly rs padta h filter mother wife bachy pura din gher p rhty h so its a must buy to protect them update fan speed got slow down power consumption on st watt nd watt rd watt max watt best is keep it on automatic mode when room will be clean power consumption will reduced to watt and whole night it work in power efficient mode do not left your room door or window open it will continue to be red room should be closedroom is still dusty not much functional

4,first of all i wanted to buy one juicer to have juice instantly so i reviewed many juice blender and finally i bought this philips hr i made carrotapple orange promoganateetc all i did and had fantastic juice fruit pulp and waste all collected in one tray and it is easy to wash thanks for this instant juice blendergood deali find this juicer amazing endtoend it takes me around mins to extract the juice clean pack it back that easy it is to usethe product is very good and user friendly exactly as demonstrated in videoi used to have juicer many moons ago but it was a cheap model and never really produced the juice i wanted and i couldnt afford the mega posh ones which juiced fruit and veg to within and inch of its life so i was excited to be able to start using this new one first off this is a nice compact design it really doesnt take up much room and it has small suckers on the base to keep it in place on the kitchen surfacethe juicer is simple to take apart and put together instructions are not really needed though there are some basic pictures provided on the boxthe juicer spout where you put your fruit and veg in is quite small i need to cut up my apples into quarters to fit them in and although this is not a huge flaw it is a shame as you wouldnt need it to be much bigger to get them in so far my juicing attempts have all been successful apples raspberries grapes cucumbers carrots have all yielded a fair amount of great tasting juice i also unwittingly popped a chopped up mango in there without realizing it is one of the starchy fruits that is apparently doesnt work with it seemed to work fine for me i can see how a banana or avocado might not work but the mango did produce juice so you may want to experiment the pulp left at the end is still fairly damp and i found i could easily squeeze liquid out but its in no way dripping and i would say a decent job had been done i know that there is a lot of goodness left in the pulp so if you want to use this then just make sure you clean your fruit before juicing and remove anything you wouldnt want in the pulp that way once you have finished juicing you can just scoop out the pulpy goodness and do whatever you want with itjuicers produce different quality juices there are really key areas to judge a juicer on its juice quality some juicers produce a higher amount of juice per food item you can tell by the drier pulp that is extracted some juicers produce frothier juice and warmer temperature juice signs of lower quality because the air and heat are evidence of the oxidization of nutrients a faster spinning juicer centrifugal will often produce more heat and froth which is why the masticating style juicer slower chewing action creates better quality juicein terms of these key areas this philips does an alright job producing dry pulp and an excellent job with low froth and low temperature juice the slow masticating action is excellent and on par with other juicers to get more descriptive i like to run the pulp of the philips through the juicer time to get extra juice out of it running it a nd time and i get hardly any juice one extra run of the pulp is sufficientthe specs for this juicer claim you can clean it in under minute i think this is a little optimistic but that said its not too far off all the plastic parts rinse clean easily and quickly with warm water and the only part which takes a little more effort is the metal sieve and grater this has teeny tiny holes in it to help separate juice and pulp and so it does get clogged up with stuff that said i have found that using a soapy scourer sponge and gently rubbing with the green side does the trick pretty swiftly it certainly does not take much elbow grease and i found it very easy to clean off unlike my previous juicer where you needed to scrub for half an hour and you were still finding bits the next time you used iti think this is a pretty decent juicer for the everyday user yes it could produce a little more liquid from the things it juices but it is certainly not bad and the stuff it produces is on the whole clear from bits the anti drip spout is not quite antidrip and you do need to watch out for juice on the fruit plunger when you put pieces in as i have whipped it out too quickly and splashed drops of fresh juice all over the place for the current price i would say it is well worth ithigh quality premium juicer with low noise and excellent ability to squeeze max to juice out of fruits and veggies the look and feel is outstanding and way above what other options are availablei have been using this for a month nowit is easy to use and clean and assemblebut at times i have seen that the pulp is also coming in the juice and sometimes it makes a different sound while it is grindingi feel the carrot and beetroot pieces should be cut a bit smaller and not like a slice cause if i cut like a sliceflat one carrot slice got stuck within the blades and the machine made a different sound and it was not giving more juice but i could see the pulptry to cut the carrot pieces of atleast inch size like a round one and not like a slicebut overall good experience as i make carrot and beatroot juice and it takes minutes to cut grind and cleanvery easy to use and very easy to assemblethanksperfect home juicer easy to clean assemble and comparable i loves it

4,value for moneynot as effective as claimed just an average product built quality medicoregood very good product very easily to use good working but charger cable is very vary short i lick thisthe product is that good as the rating show it to be and the reason for it is that the seller is bribing people for ruppee paytm cash and rating them start this is cheating the quality of the product was not up to the mark and it didnt work after daysworstrechargeable speed modes and it gives perfect and creamy frothvalue for money percent
4,product is good easy to use but there is a misleading information on amazon about warranty in amazon they mentioned years of warranty months of extended warranty but when i contacted customer care they told year of standard warranty year extended warrantymotor only on registering in thier website and only months warranty on jar bladesvery simple to useeasy to use easy to cleanthe product is goodover all very nice blender easy and convenient to use i can prepare varieties of juice and it can blend nuts as needed it works as expected recommendedeasy and quick to use especially in the mornings when there is time pressurewithin months the motor stopped workingthen after raised a compliant they picked the product and checked then informed technician confirmed that your blade is not in condition to function properlythe blade has months warranty and according to the invoice its out of warranty so you have to purchase new blade from us and they shared one video for checking the product its like one road side shop so balzano having road side shop as service center
3,the vacuum claims to have a powerful motor but it struggles to pick up even basic dirt and debris i have tried using it on both carpet and hard surfaces with little successadditionally the dust collection feature is practically nonexistent despite multiple uses the dustbin remains almost completely full after each use the lighting feature is also fairly useless as it is not bright enough to be of much use in illuminating the areas being cleanedoverall i would not recommend the swiss military vc wireless car vacuum cleaner it is a poor performer and does not live up to its claims there are much better options available on the market for car vacuum cleaners goodgood one go for itcleaning suction power as claimedsuction power is not very impressivedoes the jobstruggle for duct that sticks to the floor visible and easily removed duct is suckedworks better than the previous ones i boughtproduct seems good but months warranty card not received inside box box was damaged from one sideeasy to use and friendly
4,the first time i tried it send the eggs and the milk cream all over the kitchen big mess so i suggest that you try it with water in a cup or bowl to get the feel of it then you will fall in love with this gadget easy to clean just rinse under the tap the charge holds up just about for a job so you dont burn or heat up the motor frothing for a cup of coffee or creaming eggs for a fluffy omelette is easy peasy flimsy for ruff use but hey you cant complain for the price your payingthis is nice for people who wishes for a durable device to blend and whisk their eggs coffee milk etc for a luxurious vibe nice as it doesnt operate on battery but electric charge i feel the price might look steep but otherwise the product is a good product and easy to use and it very reasonable price i loved this product but it think that they have to increase the capacity of battery power except this all is goodits a good handy product works well and is easy to use it will definitely make your work in kitchen simplerthe product was easy to use and reachable in few minutesuseful product very good easy to use excellentvalue for moneynd easy to use

4,after going through many reviews and checking multiple brands decided to settle with philips ac not sure how accurate is the pmi number it is displaying but we can feel a noticeable difference after using it for over a month cleaning the filters also easy overall im happy with the producthighly recommend so much so that i bought another one its been month and just had to wash the first filter once and works very nicelyeveryone in the house is breathing nicely and clearlymonitors the pm level in the air exactly when i installed it in the kitchen the pm level went up as soon as the cooking started and the purifier automatically switched to higher speed and brought it down during karthigy when everyone was cracking crackers the pm level went up in the purifier indicating increase in air pollutantsgreat product no issues and work very efficientlyeasy to install no noise and air clean quicklyi did not receive an invoice and there is no serial number marked on the product i am unable to initiate any request with the manufacturerit reduces pollution indoor but take timegood purifier with almost no noise and good display of impurities in air

4,takes space and not convenient if in a hurry the handheld model would be better suited and more useful for frequent usei used this product once after reading the manual the first impression after using it on cotton shirts without starch and one pant is pathetic none of the shirts got wrinkle free on full steam hence you could guess what it would be in trouserslater i found it is satisfactory on silk nylon shirts t shirts etc but none will get an iron effect wrinkle will be there in small amount and a slight wet feel when the steam cool down but it will go if fastit is mainly useful for ladies who wear embroidered nylon silk materials stone work fabrics etc etc men who use t shirts and nylon rich trousers otherwise dont even think of buying it in my case i use cotton whites and white trousers mainly at office as i am a lawyer hence for me it is totally useless no females at home and hence it is another product that grab my home spaceregarding comfort while using it i would say i am totally disappointed as the board behind it is not much of use while using g shirt because of its size which is not that long the last two button downwards will always hard to press it to board and we have to take the hanger hold high on one hand and thus another difficult part as the nylon material needs another hands to hold it firm secondly the long full sleeves are totally difficult to do it though steam is applied the wrinkles wont go easily add we are not pressing it to board and it will always go here and there the top stand is a hanger shaped but the clips attached as useless as the board comes in between for trousers the product itself wont work good so if we use the hanger it comes with you need to put the switch off place the handle in slot take the shirt out and then only we can use the back side to steam after waiting again to steam up switch on etc otherwise steam will go on coming out of itany way the product is more useful that those similar without a pressing boardthe next negative thing is manual says for better lasting of product and to avoid decalcification the water after use should be drained and cleaned hence it means you cant use it daily morning in rush while going to office that needs little time at the same time you cant press all dress in a stretch and cant fold it like we do with iron box it wont work that away so if you have long large cupboard with hangers as in mansions you can try thatin effect buy it if you find exceptions and usages apart from what i mentioned aboveps i am seriously thinking of olx received a broked packedge with broken itemi thought it would make my task of ironing easy but its useless on cottons and silks its great to use it on chiffon and polyester do not buy thinking you wont need standard ironing anymoreit is fantastic for marriages where there are many dresses net based where you cant use iron quick good for suitsit looks like an imitation product pieces dont match properly and some look very weakvalu ed for moneyits not effective and pressing clothes effectively seems to have an issue
4,very isedul to chop veggies in a very short time elders in family use it very easily to help cooking much time saving onegood and sturdyvery nice qualitygot the same product as mentioned very much happy about the results im getting of it quality product must go for iti gifted it to mom and she lives it she only complain about cleaning but plus point is it got nice sharp bladethe plug provided with the machine for power connection is of poor quality it is loose when plugged into an electric socket one quality should be improved as it is it is not according to isi or international standards this is a c class item and the poor quality reflects very poorly on the quality control system of the manufacturereasy to use and super easy to cleanjust absolutely very good go for itbest part easy to use chopped every vegetable very smoothly
3,smoothies and dry grindingconsumes less spacemost third class product motor is not able to take load and everytime smoke comes outservice is too baddont buy this productits after months feedbacki received the product and the rotor blade along with the washer came off the grinder jar in the demo itself exchanged the product and received a piece which had scratches on it the lid of the big jar the body of the big jar the blender lid doesnt seem to quite be leakproof because of my first experience with wonderchef product i definitely had high expectations about the quality and i would say that it did not fulfill my expectations i had bought it for dhanteras and the exchange and all delayed the plan also was a lot disappointing for me now i am anxious to even use the exchanged one already the scratches have put me offit is very easy to clean there is no switch its very difficult to use without switch in the mixieasy to use easy to clean space saver handyi used this product for making pureetotally waste of purchaseone jar not working
4,the product is quite small easy to learn and light weight working finethe only sad thing is no warranty card givenmachine cover also for machine is good the free kit is also goodmachine is excellent for beginners however the package was missing the sewing kit many people have complained about a broken box but for me the entire sewing box is missinglittle difficult to get bobbin thread out from the machine saree pheeko is task maximum of times saree get stuck in the bobbin area used for basic stitching company has not provided any demo at doorstep as they are not serviceable for few pincodes need to learn on youtube only ok ok product need lot of patience initially for beginnersonly for the brand name we spent this much better buy a cheap one if you are a rarely user and beginneramazing product precise stitching and very handy loved itits very useful to all quality gooddidnt get warranty card and fabric is not moving
3,quality product but not very useful as far as ironing is concerneddelivery was on time as mentioned by amazon so keep it upthe product is kind of gift so not having much info or data in hand but whatever is shared i put it on herethe product is used twice so limited information at presentthe product is just okit is not a replacement to iron and cannot be considered so yes the steam is somewhat better than philips as the user has used philips also but as compared it should have been price competitivewell yes it is able to remove crease from jeans and even tshirtwe prefer stiff shirts for office wear so no good for formals or casual shirts neither that good for pantsthe water filler should have been round shape being a conical shape it does not give idea as to what level the water has been filledbased on the water container it can steam to clothes at a time also after to clothes the hand get pain so you cannot steam more garmentsalso you need some kind of support at the back just hanging on the hanger is not enough the manufacturer should have given a though on this and could have added an accessory either free of cost or at additional chargewell so if i get more information i will update and change based on the samegood not besti like the product but the only drawback i found isa according to the water capacity tank in just about min of usage you have to refill so that way for each cloth you have to refill the tankb its quite heavy so i dont recommend this for long use if you want to steam clothes than its fine also the cloth must not be hung up above your height other wise it will be painful for you to hold this heavy steamer above causing more pain my tip is that place the steamer on a table after pressing on the steam button once the steam gets coming out you can hold your clothes swiftly move in front of the steam inches away that way you will save yourself from the pain of holding it also pls use a plastic hanger never steam over a metal surface is a nice product but only reason i gave star is that it becomes too heavy when it is held with water filled in the bottleits only days we used this product however its awsome and really a great worker when it comes to ironing its effortless and very quickif you want to purchase a steamer go for it it weights around gm without ml water so the only concern is weight and how long u can hold it in your hand during steaming process otherwise performance wise this is by far the best machine available quality and finishing of the product are also very good certainly recommended

4,product and service reviewbuying price during prime day sale with discount from hdfc debit cardproduct reviewrating this is a new model launched during prime day from eureka forbes aquaguard line of products named aquasure delightthe product is pleasant to look and comes with a capacity of l on paper but holds only liters of water equipped with reverse osmosis ultraviolet radiation lamp and manual adjustment for total dissolved solidscan be manually adjusted only by service engineer the liter tank fills at about mins but the water wastage is very high for every litre water purified there is a drainage of litre from the drain pipe please collect the water and reuse it for washing utensils or bathing shaving or watering plants the drained water is same as tank water just with higher tds the water taste varies according to the level of tds you choose very low tds will give a good taste to water but at a loss of the mineral content of water which i will not recommend the default tds after purification is set somewhere between drinking water should have tds below manufacturer reviewrating the manufacturer of this product is eureka forbes i am giving a rate of because the product that is now installed at my home is a replaced product because the first product that i received was a defective one the drain pipe would not stop draining water even when the tank was full i asked the technician to check it and he said the valve is defective so i received a defective product out of the box i ordered for a replacement on amazon which they processed and i got another one in which the led lights were displaced i dont know it happened during transport or it is some manufacturing defect i would have been disappointed for the second time but i observed it and reported to the technician who replaced the led lights to their original position so that the led indicators were now visible outside the replaced products valve is functional and now operating without any hassleservice reviewdont expect to have a very comfortable installation experience its going to be a heartache the reasons are the people eureka forbes has employed as technicians are thieves i am saying this because aquasure delight comes with integrated diverter valve this is a stainless steel structure that is fitted to water outlet coming from the wall so that it can act as converter to be joined to the aquaguard inlet as i hadnt opened the package when it arrived because some or many of the companies void the warranty of you open the box containing the product mostly electrical items that need installation like tvs washing machines taking the precaution i didnt open the box so i was unaware that diverter is included in the package the technician after fitting the diverter charged rs saying that he fitted that from his side and diverter is not included in the package i came to know this when i opened the package of the replaced product and found the diverter included along and confronted him but he defended saying some purifiers have diverter in them and some dont i still have to confirm this with eureka forbes the pre filter doesnt come included in the package so the technicians sell it to you at higher prices my technician sold it to me at rs which is available at amazon at rs but then if had ordered it from amazon i have to install it by myself i dont have a drill etc so i had to pay him rs so loss of rs on the technician my opinion on this is that eureka forbes should sell water purifiera with pre filter even though it raises the cost of the product by rs to rs platform reviewthe platform in which i bought is of course amazon i am giving it a rating of because i received a defective product the first time and amazon refused to replace it because installation request was not raised by amazon amazon never raises an installation request unlike flipkart which raises an installation request from its side which actually makes your life easy as in case if you receive a defective product which you notice after installation flipkart directly consults with the technician and may even resend him to verify the authenticity of the problem for installation you have to call the eureka forbes toll free number and raise an installation request so amazon representative was demanding an installation report a video or photo proof of the problem now how could i make that thief of a technician to write an installation report and about taking a photo or video i got the water purifier uninstalled as soon as i found it defective to put it up for replacement but i didnt know replacement request has these many hassles as it was my first time replacing an electronic productsummary product is good for the mentioned priceaquasure comes with integrated diverter valve a stainless steel device that is attached to your water outlet and the aquaguard dont let your technician charge you for it the technician will overcharge you for pre filter be ready for that technicians are cunning and mostly thieves so be sharp around them make sure product is not defective if it is amazon is going to give you a hard time replacing it amazon will not raise an installation request you have to raise it by yourself by calling eureka forbes customer careoverall verdict if your family in members you have choice eureka forbes delight rouvtds this product is very effective and efficient agua guard provides installation with in hours of delivery before the installation had tds level is and after the installation had tds level is nice product by aquaguard water taste is also sweetthis is very good water purifier but i see service guy for installation seems in hurry he just installed and went off he did not show how much is tds how to adjust it dont buy this product on amazon buy it from local stores if possiblei purchased this product on a heavy festival discount there was problem initially after installation due to defective water holding knob i reported this issue and immediately replacement was arranged although i had to wait for about two weeks the serviceman came and installed another piece since then it is working excellently in all the best part was that the services were good and responsiveamazon part of the business was smoothdelivery done within timelines payments exchange cashback all done hassle freeeureka forbes another storyfor installation i had to call them daily for daysfinally on escalation and on hold with eureka forbes customer service for close to minutes installation was doneeureka forbes now calls me every other day to force this reviewmy main reason for writing this reviewi got the purifier installed and before that i was having bislery water reason why i have so many bottles which thankful came handy the deliver and installation was smooth after installation the agent mentioned to let the filter fill up completely and then throw away all the st batch of filtered water since its the st time filteration process so it will basically clense it overallso i decided to let it full up and once it was full i turned off the switch so no more whater comes in i used the empty l bislery bottles to fill up the st batch of filtered water which as shown in the image which is around l as mentioned by the companyafter i emptied the filter to its last drop i turned on the filter with another set of empty bottles at the waste pipe side it took quite a while to fill up the tank fully but as it did it filled up almost l worth of bottles as seen in the image this is roughly or more than twice the amount of filtered waternow the company claims water saved in comparison to other rouv filters and i have no knowledge of how much water wastage they do but i think its a bit much regardlessfir every l of purified water it wastes lmy tal water tds is filtered water tds is and the waste water tds is maybe its because of the tds levels due to which it wastes as much water ky does and its possible that the amount might vary for different tds levels at sourcebut i recommend to have the waste water collected and used for something else if possible rather than just letting it drain down l almost everyday wasted is l per month and this is considering you only filter l of water per dayill redo this once more to see if theres any difference in values this is juts to keep the potential buyers informedi like speed to fill water n less wastage i like tds adjuster and easy to install i dont like internal plastic body though i believe its steel need confirmation overall good product we are satisfied having it installed from weeksdeserve a star on product however ran into a problem when it comes to installation the technicians of the servicing centre at my local area gave me a huge problem by delaying the installation at last one technician came forward
3,been months since i got these i can slowly see the fabric coming off and the bare cardboard peeking through but it depends on how you handle it in my opinion but they can be folded flat and stored in tiny spaces which is greatcost high but goodsuper very good thing to keep casual clothesave been using it for a month now and this is the current conditionvery nice product good to store items
4,this is aesthetically the most appealing digital kitchen scale out of the available choices though it is also by far the most expensive it is value for money considering the followig pros functionality it has only two touch buttons which integrate all the functions like units of weight volume multiple tare weigh with overload indication and offon it can give volume idications for water and milk two of the most frequently used liquids while other liquids can be also measured if a glass of water is calibrated for a certain volume say ml ad same is marked on the glass the plastic food grade bowl fits snugly on the scale and also doubles up as a cover when the scale is not in use duraility because of its squat oblong shape and sure footing the scale wont topple also since bowl fits snugly on the scale upside down when the scale is not being used it prevents dust from entering the display and buttons material is tough plastic with a recessed top which seats the bowl firmly and there is no exposed space for ingress of any spilt liquid with all this theres a one year warranty extendable to two years which speaks about the confidence of the manufacturers in their own design battery life the device has an auto power off and a digital display which consumes very less power hence battery is likely to last longeri only encountered two cons scale is very sensitive and takes some time to settle the display backlight goes away after some time and the lcd reading is difficult to read in bright ambient lightoverall this device serves my purpose of practical diet management very efficiently and effectively and am sure it will grow on me recommended if you want to get much more utility and eficiency at a slightly higher pricelitt to adjust all timeok price wise it didnt last long
4,bestonly issue is that you might misjudge its size its kind of too big especially if youre living in hostels like me using it for anything other than boiling water usually turns out to be pretty inconvenient for that reason even washing it at times but overall quality is really good its a good product only suitable for specific use cases though good for homesthe kettle is very handy to use and the capacity of it makes the work easier i loved the new colour choices they are offeringthe size is sufficient and may be a bit large for single person usage one suggestion is that a temperature control knob could have been provided in this price range otherwise a very good product finish is excellenttakes a little longer duration for boilingthe problem is the outer of kettle which easily charms the dust smudge no matter whatever available kitchen cleaning products u apply the blotch stains are signified to be permanent go for other than white colourvery useful product and it is working good price is reasonable worth itlike the metal base
4,the decision to buy thispurely on the cost of similar branded item is around rs i use this vacuum cleaner only occasionally and based on my need and i feel floor requires vaccum cleaningunder the above condition this item serves purposeconssmade in china and they importing and marketing in india sound i feel not at my comfort zone but others also make similar noise lenth of power chord smaller compared to other brander ones no demo was arranged youtube video was their reply for my request for demo even in metro like bangalore no customer support or services in case instrument goes faulty over time in bangalorei donot know how they service the instrument over phonewho has to bear to the cost of transportation and how it will workoutprosworks as per the specificationsuction power is good noise level ok free movement there can be an improvement in the sponge quality since while using the blower the same gets sucked in the steel tub further if the company can provide a video on how to effectively use the product it would be great and also how to avoid pressure on the motor since the hose pipe bends while using the productnice product i liked suction power but on right side extra blowing out apart from blower side i dont why and steel body build quality is too low if small partical touch it ll get dent its ok over all product is good ok okthe suction power of the vaccum cleaner is really good only drawback is that after using it for some time i observed that the suction hose is leaking the air which is making a whistling sound i tried reaching out the customer service and they informed me that the whistling sound when using the blower mode is quite normal the outer container is made of steel and is of good quality when i received the product i observed a dent in the bodybought recently and initial usage is quite good its convenient and easy to use performs well on floors mattress and sofas blower function works as expected a bit tough to clean mosquito mesh through grillsi have been using this vaccume cleaner for the last month and i am very happy with the product i have been using it mostly for sofa cleaningits suction power is really good pipe should have more length cant reach slabs other wise nice
4,its very easy to use and easy to clean it does its jób as described only drawback is that the motor unit heats up v very quickly even with very little use i have only used this product twice so far so i cant speak for its durability also the price has been dropping steadily on this product wondering whyonly time will tell how long this product will lastawesome built quality with perfect packagingblender is working goodworking good till noweasy to use to clean n all i make a lot of sauces purees and dressings i use my blender almost every day but the construction of the blender is such that the food often falls below the blades and i am constantly readjusting the ingredients to get the ingredients blended it can take a considerable amount of time and a lot of patience but this immersion blender can puree fruits and vegetables in less than minutes and do it evenly and consistently it is easy to use and lightweight cleaning consists of removing the shaft with the blades and handwashing it you can wipe off the handle with a damp cloth and stick both in a drawer my standard blender requires thorough washing of the various parts pitcher blades screw on attachment and lid so i am moving the standard blender from the counter to storage if i need it i have it i highly recommend this powerful blender go for it
3,its good product you can face challenge in starting but once you learn this is easy you can sew clothes from anywhere you wantthe product works well we can use for quick fixes option to use power adapter is very usefulcons cant change direction of stitchcant stich fabric in middle if its big only edges can be stitched comfortablyadd ons especially the threader given are very flimsyits an ok ok product easy to use but you have to put knot to hold the stitches together portable and good for emergency purposeits good overall just it need to be tied everytime u sew its really smooth working and good quality of the threadoknice product budget friendly worth itnot so easy to useeasy to use

4,over all good easy to usebut do remember there is no existing button to set hard medium and soft boil its totally depend on how much you have fill water levellike ml for hard boilit just different way to fool people to show up soft medium and hard boil facilitygood product and does the job as advertised autocut off is there but the power switch doesnt turn off automatically it should be done manually which we can forget once cooled down this will turn on even water is not there so switching off is mandatory i have kept a smart plug with mins count down to overcome this issueoverall it is a good equipment to boil eggs but there should have been change in button it says automatic off but machine is not really off it will restart again when machine cools down because power button was kept on button should turned off automatically to avoid restart hence star lessused three times so far boiled eggs each time and perfect results each time very happy with the product will provide long term review after couple months thanks amazon thanks borosileasy to use producteggs r clocked perfectly follow the manual properly then it will be easy to usea very user friendly products makes boiled eggs very quickly also the feature of making poached eggs is usefuloverall a very good product
4,a great product of convenience the only drawback being the heating or grilling time seems to be a little more after regular use than it was when brand new but otherwise a great product to reduce all the hustlecame with a small scratch on the casing and box was not sealed otherwise its okpros good brand value two year warranty easy operation evenly cooked food decently pricedcons weight distribution is not even tumble when press on handle cut off time is confusing mostly power cut before food is fully cooked there is no locking for griller no power regulatorover all its a good buy for domestic usethe product is great but its size isnt good im not able to cook even jumbo bread sandwich in it the bread comes out of the griller and some part of sandwich is left uncookedworks fine no issuesi am in love with this griller toaster it is so sleek and compact in design with complete ss finish for safety use food is cooked in minutes because of watt it is so good i frequently grill my veggies paneer etc on this comes with auto cut feature to avoid food from burninggood in griling its w so fast grilingbut one problem power cord lenght is too short

3,this machine can easily brew coffee for a family of members at a time some people asked whether this can be used in a cafe the answer is simple no reason is that this isnt a sophisticated machine like a professional commercial grade coffee brewernow my experience with this machine was good and a bad thing was that i did not get the steam pipe sleeve except that everything was well packed when you buy this machine make sure to rinse the internal passage throw the first water from the machine thoroughly wash the caraffe puck filter and measurement spoon remember to never use dishwash gel or soaps to wash carafe puck or anything such it may ruin the coffee aromamethod efficient as per my opinion fill the water in tank no need to measure it as it can be controlled with the selector dont run it dry it may damage the heating element or pump switch on the machine after that pour the ground coffee powder inside the filter level it and press it to compress i use ratio spoon of coffee powder to spoon of water at output before changing over to drip mode open the steam valve and check if sufficient pressure is built placing carafe under the puck slowly move the selector till europa and quickly back it to steam icon this will let the coffee bloom inside after seconds slowly move the selector upto espresso the decoction should be not too slow or not too runny wait till your desired quantity is reached and quickly change the selector to steam mode take milk in a tumbler which is slightly larger than the level of milk place the tumbler under the steam pipe such a way that the tip should immerse just slight under milk meniscus slowly open the steam valve located at the side steam it as per your need mix the milk and decoction thats itremember to not uncap the top lid after usage as there may still be pressure inside open the steam valve and let all the pressure get releasedcoffee used bombay island espresso grind medium roast use only espresso grind or maybe south indian filter grind dont use aeropress v or any other grind as it may not produce desired tastei personally like this machine for the price its good and build quality is moderate please watch some youtube videos if you are new to coffee machines its very very easy to ruin coffee without proper knowledge you may also watch james hoffmann he is world barista champion and shares tips about coffeeim a fan of espresso every time i go to a coffee joint i tend to order a doppio a double shot espresso but those prices are way too high if i wished to drink a cup of espresso twice everyday so ive decided to buy this machine one thing to say the quality and durability depends on the user if you take care the machine would take care of your cup of joeso how do you properly clean this thing is the question raised by many guests after seeing always rinse the drip tray use dish washing liquid with water to clean the carafe do not hit the filter basket to drop the used grounds run water over it forcefully to loosen the grounds this is crucial because dents can affect quality before and after your brewing activities make sure that you clean the internals to do this fill the carafe till the mark with bottled water assemble an empty permafilter switch on and set the strength to max in about a minute you can see steaming hot water flow into the carafe check its color if its yellow then rinse and repeat if it is white dry everything and switch it off then either do your coffee brewing or assemble it back and call it a day always let the steam out when you froth milk immediately wipe off the residual milk with a lint free clothwarning never ever use hardtap water it causes serious limescaling issues which can greatly affect the taste quality of your coffee it may also cause digestive issues always use softcan waterthe water must not taste salty or sweet take this seriously please do not post misleading reviews stating that my machine brokethe steam knob is the worst part of this machine the machine was used just for days then the steam knob decided to loosen up and fall off i called the service center they told me to bring it there the problem is im just and i cant drive and the service center is far away so i removed the rubber casket and fixed the knob directly it comes off but i think ill use it only to ease the pressure because i always drink it black but this issue makes me reduce a startips for using the machine use fine grounded coffee i use narasus pb or royal elite bold currently im using phalada pure sure organic coffee powder for the best results you must grind the coffee on your own if you cant make sure the coffee is fresh mind that using instant coffee powder or using coffee mixed with chicory can lead to disaster both for the machine and your stomach respectively you can also go for lavazza but it makes a hole in your wallet deeper than the mariana trench only use good quality bottledcan water maintain a good cleaning discipline in case youve used hardtap water immediately do a descaling refer your instruction manual always tamp your ground in the filter you must apply about pounds of force this is about kg of force hold the force for about seconds and slowly rotate the tamper before removing it make sure the filter lock is up when doing thisas you can see this is a real espresso maker it produces crema provided that you use fresh and the correct coffee for me it produced about mm crema for a double shot this is good for a steam driven machine note that this is a steam driven machine you can never get the finish of coffee joints because they use dual boilers powered by thermoblock pumps although the tastes would be similar provided you use the correct beansplease look at the pics to see the finish the cirrus clouds like crema was from coffee powder a week old the brown and rich crema is from that organic coffee powder ive just bought can you notice the finish being directly proportional to the freshness this applies even to taste the white crema cup tasted a bit bitter and left a bittery taste in my mouth the brown crema cup tasted like coffee at its best leaving a crisp and nutty taste also after i did some research i came to know that an espresso must have three layers a bitter crema a sweet middle and a nutty acidic bottom you must mix these before drinking to have the best shot if you see the glass picture ive attached you can clearly see those layersoverall this is a great espresso machine for a beginner it makes great espresso and it is economical too as i said if you

3,its good and easy to usethe product appears cheap but works alright as you might know from the product description there are speed settings decent product for this price rangeits very nice n poweful but needs proper care n cleanup after every use also u should keep changing batteries when u see the power low been using it for years now however piece lasts for about a year if taken proper carethe compartment to insert cells should have been a little bigger it might break while trying to squeeze the cells inthis a useful product very easy to use and clean looks very light but is of good quality froths milk efficiently a must buy if you like frothy coffee or milk waste productdont buy this by its brand name or by its pricevery delicate productthis is certainly a great product saves time as getting a froth in a conventional way you need to be very patient nowadays everyone needs something quick this served my purpose bought extra that i am planning to gift thank you
4,writing this review after a month of useworks absolutely fine i use it for my tailoring projects i had a question regarding water dripping bt the company was prompt to send salesman and resolve my queries also a tip that i have heard from alot of technician and sounds logical to increase the life of ur machine is to use filter was tap water has alot of impurities and gets stuck and reduces the life of iron i have seen that myself with my other steam iron as it leaves small dust particles on the waterstorage area so do that will solve leaking issues if u ought to have anywanted a heavy steam iron this works very well lots of steam and easily irons out clothes very easy on fabrics too so you are able to use the high steam setting to remove out wrinkles on clothes without worrying about the fabric setting too mucheasy to use and all types of clothesnice its did its purpose nicely happycup to pour water must have been includedheat up very quickly no water dripping steam is good and dont stick i use filter water to keep it clean
3,okthe product works very well the support is also good the product was not delivered with the required water inlet and outlet connecting pipe and a pin electric plug had to run around for procuring them wish bajaj packaged this in the producti bought this three months back till now no complaints and using with out any issuesits taking time to get hot waterthe screw required for installation is missing is good but installation charges are high
3,good to usereally good product in this price as compared to other expensive products does its job properly roller doesnt come out if you scroll it properly adhesive is good in removing febric lints doesnt come with a cover but you can keep the used sheet wrapped till next use then you can remove it to get fresh sheeteasy and handyworks but adhesive could have been betterits exactly as the pictures of the product the roller works well and does the job go for it if you need one i have pets at home cats and i need to use this everydaywill definitely repurchase the roller and the frame is loosely tied and cuts hand every time i use the whole roller disassembles quickly while in use the adhesion is not very good and finishes when rolled timesi ordered this because my pets hairs always stick on my clothes this product removes those hairs easily but in one jeans or shirt you need at least two sheets and also the roller comes down which make cuts on fingers so for cleaning really good but not at all easy to useeasytouse can go for it
4,apart from it leaving a watermark on table its been a good experiencegood product but one issue i found that the head from where cool mist air comes should be flexible to rotate to any direction now suppose you are keeping in table and sitting on chair then all cool mist will go above instead of coming to youmy sleep quality improved by this product and it gives the feeling of freshnessoperating manual inadequately written the nd diagram is not labeled water filling method not mentionedmost importantly the cord length is too small why being so thrifty most switch boards are at about ft height cord does not support this height as said can be a great productnice productthe quality of the product is normal very thin plastic refilling water is a tricky job as we have to fill it up side down the instructions are not clear if the product is tilted a little it behaves differently the led lights are delicate and i think loose as wellits an awesome product humidifier helped my baby to sleep better due to nasal congestion so relieved as a mother

4,no doubt product is good but after month product auto power cut funtion not working so try to claim warrenty but havells said talk to amazon and amazon said talk to havells both the comany raise our hand by the way product gave year warrenty but they gave me only excusses very bad experiences with havells never expectedits good the ony pro and cons can be the flap pros us can say is that the flap can be used for wider bucket of water for heating cons u can say is the again the flaps bcoz while not in use flaps must be closed and you cant hang the heater anywhere bcoz there is no option given flaps can cause issue bcoz it have to be kept on the ground while not in use rest all is good auto cut feature is bestcord length is shortenergy efficiency good temperature control too goodi realt like the design and auto shutoff features of the product but theres is also design flaw that you cant insert it into the half filled bucket and water should be fullawesomevery good productenergy efficiency is ok not good
4,overall nice poduct just one problem is that is the cord length only rest awesome easy to clean and easy to handlewe used this for sandwich making and it performed well the plates for grill and waffle making are readily interchangeable the cord length is adequate although slightly longer cord would have been greatthe device is readily portable because of its size and weight overall very useful quality of product is goodused a couple of times and sandwitch came goodi wanted a sandwich maker and refused to buy one from a store since it was all kk and didnt have half the features that i was looking for saw this and love ibell as an upcoming indian brand own an electrical sander too so didnt think twice and got this dont regret it one bit pros are the interchangeable plates for different ourposes grill one is just fantastic to hear all kinds of sandwiches and rolls and other food all the plates are easily removable and washable too only con that i saw to this was the latch wasnt properly latching while making a heavily loaded sandwich in the sandwich maker otherwise its a top of the range product in comparison with other big brandsall the functionalities works pretty well only thing is it should have had auto switch off feature nevertheless it is a very good product and worth the money sandwich also gets made fasti ordered vguard removable plates sandwich maker but it came in faulty the plates eject button had an issue later i ordered this one as was recommended by someone i know its of good quality only that could have been somewhat lower price
3,bought this almost a month ago so far it works well suction power is above average blower feature is a nice addition only con is its a bit loudvery nice productreally amazingits very sturdy wheels are very good so u can take it wherever you want electric cable is longdeserves the purposejust value for moneygood for domestic usevery powerfull motor best product i like itthe product is good honestly i have tested it for cleaning the dry dirt and in that this works greatgood long power chord and nice attachments that gives the cleaning abmngle a better approach
2,not sufficient powerthe product is more like a toy for kids cant use it as a proper juicer power back up is very pooroki had to replace this product first time because it was leaking and now after replacement the new one has no battery backup and vibrates too muchthe mrp is above rupees which is not at all justfied by the productafter buying the product i found that with the product they are giving a cashback offer of to rs if you give star review probably thats why it has good ratings i feel i was fooled by the ratingswaste product as the juicer is leaking which creates the whole place mess and the juicer doesnt grind properly where the pieces of fruits remain ungrinded i generally dont write reviews but i was forced to write this one as this is just waste of moneyspend it wisely for something betterits does not work properly at all after charging for hours the battery last only sec very bad productand they have given a cashback coupon to attract good ratingmisleading information is given on the detail pagei bought this mostly for milk shake and it does an amazing job and it is affordable but it didnt worked while charginguser friendly blender very useful for the pg accommodaters i am using this to make a protein shake from day one when i was received from amazon

4,the pricing is good using is very easy but the product is not too much worth to buyi have been using a similar coffee percolator for over years now and my old workhorse a chinese nova is still capable since it was white and therefore a very unappetising sight now i needed a new onepackaging the design of packaging was perfect stiff corrugated sandwich board box foam profiled panels stuck on board for bottom and top board wrapping around the glass kettle the whole unit inside a thick ply cover frankly this sort of packaging is more common in high end audio equipment plus for the packaging designsize this is a small machine and will make about ml of coffee sufficient for mugs in one go if you need a larger volume look elsewherebody and finish the plastic body is well made the matte finish looks good the bottom metal plate is seamless and black will have to wait and see when spots appear the kettle is good quality glass and though no branding is present feels thick enough to withstand minor washing bumps the filter bucket and the holder with the flow control spring is ok hopefully the spring and washer which are fixed will last the lid moves smoothly and the hinges and the sprinkler also look sturdy switch is firmfunction it worked very well on the first use i had used an extra coffee filter paper on top of the nylon filter bucket the flow was smooth coffee liquor starts weak and then picks up strength the drip stops well with the removal of the kettle and though the manual cautiously states a sec gap for drip stop i did not find any leakage on longer removaloverall very satisfied with my new coffee maker recommend buyingproduct doesnt work within a montheasy to use and it turned out better than i expected it to be for the pricejust magnificent saves lot of timethe plastic quality for this product is poor it feels like a toy i had bought a amazon basics air fryer it had great build quality comparing to this amazon basics productif you try to find a replacement part it costs twice its valueits cheap and breakable and the coffee is very very lightwaste of coffee and also not a good flavournice product and simple to use

4,purchased from amazon for full price under no offers still beat competitors by rsorder was placed on thursday late in the evening at pmwas to be delivered on thursday but arrived early on monday at amquite satisfied with the delivery packaging condition of the item and also happy with the early arrivalalong with the vacuum we received a basic instruction manual and warranty cardthe invoice was missing from the parcel so it had to be downloaded from amazonto register your warranty you require to scan the bar code on the invoice and whatsapp the detailswithout any delay excitedly we got to assemble the unit which was a fairly easy task took approximately minutes which i guess is ok for the first time while getting familiar with all various attachments etcfirst impressions the vacuum itself looks sturdy built wise but some attachments could be a little stronger especially the extension pipes could be stainless steel same as the drum and telescopic in feature operation the main vacuuming head attachment used for floor hard surfaces could also be stainless steel as it gets used the most and gets banged around quite a bit would extend its lifeits a pin plug instead of a pin which could have been better with a surge protector fusethe cord is of decent length quite impressed with the quality of the cord also the cord which has no autowind and cannot be inserted within the body of the unit after use can be rested on top of the drum in a winding fashion it kinda works and does keep in place without being a nuisance hose same solutionthe side latches are reasonably strong wheels are easy to install insert and work fineit would be absolutely fantastic if the various attachments could be stored latched to the main unit while not in use storage wise but can understand the limitations in this regardfirst demo was for the vacuumnoise average not too loud or unbearable reasonable with any other domestic vacuum of similar powerinside the lid the dust bag clings on to its inlet would be better if it could be secured locked with a clipin vacuum suction mode the air gets forced out of the blower outlet this outlet is directed on the opposite side of the unit and is directed straight onto the floor level now imagine if you had not yet cleaned that part of the room and that dust gets thrown around or blown onto the already cleaned surfaces it would be an unending job like a dog chasing its tail if this outlet had a removable or having the ability to rotate something like a flap or adjustable ac vents like in cars then it could direct the blown out air upwards while vacuuming the surfaces and this could have been of great design sensesuction is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing does the job which is importantthen follows the demo for the blowerthis feature should technically be equally as strong as the vacuum because the force of the air sucked in while vacuuming is supposedly the same force leaving the blower outlet to make things interesting there are fish gill like vents on either sides of the lid these vents are the fixed kind cannot be closed or opened one of the vent very faintly can be felt takingin air while the other vent blows out air at a significant force this particular phenomena i am bewildered with cause as i understand the escaping rate of air through this vent will weaken the force supposed to leave the blower outlet so make of it what you will still does the job if youre looking at blowing leaves or scaring the neighbours petfinally the demo for the wetperformance is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts and as other customers have described in their video demonstrations again nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing does the job which is important may need to dry mop even after using the wet functionin closingdefinitely do purchase it use it often as required and also helps keeping fitdo not allow dust to settle on your vacuum bloweralso ordered extrai american micronic replacement dust bag for amivcdwdx amivcdwdxii rodak mm mattress and upholstery nozzle for vacuum cleaner wet and dry cleaning eu importit have the best suction power among the wet and dry vaccum cleaner even better than some of the dry vaccum cleaners i bought this for my mother inlaw she likes it for being easy to use its simple and easy to connect and remove dust covers and pipes extension pipes are little loose though its easy to clean those cat hairs now and dont have to worry about accidentally sucking the water from the floor because its wet and dry vaccum cleaner hope the customer care is a good one incase of any needs arise they send me already opened package but not used i think they could have send us a fresh unopened perfectly sealed package no complaints untill now i liked the reusable dust cover feature also its easy to connect it inside easy to handle dont have too much weightit would have been better if there was an auto winding of power cables with a switchthis is a domestic beast great suctiononly thing that should had been ther is speed controlnoise level is high but with such suction is ok as long as it cleans it all without ne to redo it again and again i am okrest how it will stay with time will be something to seeit is very easy to clean as the suction power is great very powerful machine indeedi have been looking for a good vaccum cleaner for a long time now i recently came across this and read the reviews etc some were good and some were bad but at the same time i couldnt find any better specifications in any of the other vaccum cleaners in this price segment so i finally bought itit came in a big amazon box well packed and secured unboxed and it was as perfect as in the stock images here is the list for you to understand the pros and cons as easily as possible very good quality steel and plastic build the suctionkpa is really really good even with the thick carpets etc the wheels are really good toothey move effortlessly you get a lot of accessories to clean different surfaces and theyre good quality the blower function is really powerful the bag insidewhich collects the dust dirt is big and can be cleaned washed easily the noise level isnt much its okay not loud the cord length is mtrs which is enough the overheating protection is good all the accessories can be stored at the given spaces on the basecons the only thing that i think should be improved is the locking mechanism of the extension pipes they are good and fit well but if its a carpet or some other mats youre cleaning you need to tighten it well otherwise it loosens and needs to be tightened again and again overall a product which fits all your needswet and dry cleaning of course better than any other vaccum cleaners in under k price range go for it ps ive tried some other vaccum cleaners too which are in the k and above range but this is the all in one op vaccum cleanergood suction with great built qualitygood durabilitygood suction power and quality productvacuum cleaner is very fine suction power is quite good drying power is also just oknoise level is high as i expected cost is high as compared to other brands overall i rated it four star

4,very happy with the product performanceinstallation very easy to start using had to wait for days for the technician but with the instructions from box you can start yourself without waitingin the box disposable mops washable mops side brushes main brush mopping plate deebot dust chamber with hepa filter charging dock cable user manual cleaning brushcleaning performance superb cleaning with power options quiet normal max and max lower suction means lower battery consumption with higher suction power even the minutest dust particles will be cleaned up good if you have children in the house higher suction also means you need to clean the dust chamber more frequently in all the power options the house will look clean and will collect most visible dust the higher options are for deep cleaning also if you have groves or areas that accumulate dust over time in the flooring the higher power will pull out dust from these tiny placescleaning pattern st edges of the room are cleaned and then it will run a northsouth or eastwest cleaning pattern inside the edges no specific patterns like y or spiralmopping performance the mopping also has electronically controlled water usage low medium high ultra high the app shows warnings when using high and ultra high the robot may slip due to water on the floor but i have been using high water flow on ceramic tiles and have not faced such a problem the wheels of the robot have good grip which help with the higher water settings the mopping will become more and more effective over time with usage of the reusable mopping pad as it gets older more area will touch the floor than a new mopping pad for the st week the mopping is not as good as the mopping pad does not entirely touch the floor but with usage the shape of pad will adapt and you will get better resultscorner cleaning cms of wall corners may not be cleaned esp if you dont have straight walls eg if you have a bathroom door which has a cm cutout in the wall then the corner area around the door might not be cleaned degree wall corners may have a cm area which is not cleaned however the side brushes are large enough for most of these corners all other areas with obstacles such as chair or table legs will be properly cleaned deebot may run around them or timescorner mopping as the deebots mop is round it will not reach the corners expect a cm area in the degree wall corners not being mopped however on straight walls the cleaning is very effective as it may only miss cms which however will be cleaned by side brushesimportant if you have black furniture black stone wall tiles mirrors or any reflective furniture at the height where deebots top mounted laser is located the corner area near that black furniture will not be cleaned by deebot the laser is not able to properly recognize that it is a wall and will run a few centimeters away from that wall this is important to consider if you have substantial amount of blacks in your house as the cleaning will be less effectivemapping the st run will map the entire house and you need to follow deebot as it maps so that no areas are obstructed subsequent runs will update the map with any obstacles eg chairs and tables if they were not initially mapped the n version does not have additional sensors as the pro version so it may crash into smaller items that the top mounted laser cannot directly see also you can save at maximum of maps at a time floors the st run will be a very random cleaning pattern after the st run you can edit the rooms divide or merge areas and rename the rooms based on some preset options like living room bed room kitchen etc once the rooms are mapped deebot will clean each room in the subsequent run and then you will be able to see proper cleaning patternthe created maps are not editable you cannot move or adjust boundaries you have option to add virtual boundaries as a line or as a rectangle box where the robot should not go this is extremely useful if you have mirrors or reflecting furniture at the height of deebot deebots laser reflects off the mirrors and assumes there is area of the house where it may be able to go behind the mirror so you need to manually block this mapped area behind the mirror with a virtual boundary or box deebot will automatically detect carpets and not mop over them if you have installed mopping plate then deebot will ignore carpet area also there is an option to mark areas as no mop areas similar to virtual boundaryapplication use i used the android application for setup and regular cleaning functions the app has an advanced mode which works as per the stored map if you turn it off deebot will start cleaning wherever you place it eg i have a balcony which cant be accessed by the deebot directly i can pickup and place it in the balcony turn advanced mode off and start cleaning once it is done it will return to the place where you put it and notify that docking station is not accessiblethe app also has cleaning modes with advanced mode turned on area cleaning select a room or multiple rooms to clean auto clean clean the entire house custom cleaning select an area on the map to cleanyou can preset the sequence in which you want to clean the rooms you can also set different vacuum and water levels for each room or can use a common setting for the entire house you can also preset how many times options are once or twice you want to clean a specific room you can also set multiple cleaning schedules based on which room you want to clean at what time of the day deebot will start working automatically however this is not advisable if you are mopping as per the technician you must remove mopping plate after use if any water leaks onto the parts it may void warrantythere is an option to auto boost suction on carpets to max you can set the option for continuous cleaning ie whether you want deebot to auto restart cleaning if it runs out of charge midway deebot will only recharge partially based on the remaining cleaning area resume the cleaning and then return to recharge this saves timethe app also shows usage period of accessories in hours and the total expected usage time it is an ecovacs recommendation to replace the accessories side brush main brush hepa filter this area of the app also shows how to clean or maintain with images which is really helpfulthe app shows a history of cleaning cycles with maps this helps to check if any areas were not cleanedcleaning and maintenance expect that instead of cleaning the house daily you will be washing the mopping pad every day and cleaning deebot once every week depending on the size of your house cleaning will take around to minutes remove all hairs from side brush main brush and wheels remove the dust chamber remove the hepa filter and wash the dust chamber wash the main and side brushes if needed clean all the sensors of deebot with a dry cloth let the washed accessories dry and then reinstall them also remember that the investment in a robot is not a onetime cost you will need to replace the accessories every months based on the usage and maintenance consider the replacement cost also while evaluating a price point for investment in a robot vacuumoverall rating the cleaning and mopping performance is very good and better than a house maid in most circumstances eg deebot goes under the sofas expect manual work such as clearing the rooms before running the cleaning cycle and cleaning areas out of reach of deebot in this price range i am very satisfied with the performance
4,quality very good but injection syringe must be add in this kitit is an original product got it at a discounted price everybody should consider itgenuine product from kentkent gold optima gold spare kit is a very good product i purchase this product nd time it is very good for usenicegood producti bought it for second time good product with no complaintsಉತತಮ
3,filter not effectivethe best water purifier i have ever seen it purifies the water and their is no impurities present in it i have used other products but this is the best the quality is also very good and durable highly recommendedim literally value for money very easy to install everything written on the description box also its budget friendly value for money and easy to installthis thing doesnt hold on to the tap even if you use the attachments given the screw cannot be tightened and as such it does not hold on to the tap once the tap is opened it slips and falls away a very cheap product and i am unable to return it nowfilters wellextremely poor quality with no manufacturers identity useless product i advise everyone to not buy this productdont buy this product dont serve the purpose
2,the heating capacity is zero moreover i have initiated return request noone has come to collect itbest heater at this price quality is very good suggest everyone to purchase this heater amazing product to buy
4,good product to buyvalue for moneyeasy to usegood productmixer grinder is good easy to use and sound bit high but all the jar lid is not good so cheap quality lid its get removed top lid plastic handle comes out from top but overall is good and easy to usehis cap system is not goodgoodnice
3,to useitems tap is not good for usersvery good value for money working fineit is not suitable for my tapi likedso product good so happy amazon liked amazon products provided sum like this
3,plastic material not good just oknice pedestal fan for havells companysupplied without remotei cannot fit the oscillating knob of of the fan so the fan cannot be made steady i am afraid that the inside fitting for this knob is broken or misfitted hence the problemplease rectify the problem immediately if unable to rectify please give me replacementfan safety grill clamp very low quality plasticim impressed with this fangood quality
3,nice product low noise and good suction power in price range received damaged packet and without hose pipe but over all product is good worth of moneyreceived the product on time have used it once to clean and its easy to use works well the heating concern mentioned by prior reviewers is apt however dont a damper for a purchase at this price its a decent product in the affordable category the floor attachment particularly works very well it is light weight and so cleaning lower end of ceiling fans was easy the suction power when using sofa attachment is quite good in cleaning dust stuck in stitching corners overall if you want to spend minimally and get all relevant attachments and your usage is for a bed or a smaller sized apartment this product is a good startcarpet bohot ache se clean nhi kar paata baaki normal cleaning ache se kar deta hegot this vacuum cleaner after a lot of research and it has been a good choice till now i wanted a handheld vacuum cleaner for both car and home cleaning purposes my primary requirements were cleaning my car and gaming chairssofas a car vacuum cleaner only wouldnt have suited the purpose also i wanted a powerplugged vacuum cleaner as the one with a battery can be used only for a certain amount of time and there is a long charging period of waitthis product ticks all the requirements it has a m power cable that is long enough to use comfortably the suction power is good at kpa unlike the kpa of most batterypowered cleaners noise is okay i mean it isnt so much to disturb someone until and unless someone is really allergic to noiseit has several components that helped clean my car and even my fabric gaming chair and i was also able to see a visible difference in the window meshesyes it gets heated after several minutes of usage but i could use it with a wait of minutes each time its weight is ample for horizontal and downwards usage i havent used the stick provided and i think it might be a little bit difficult to use it upwards on walls if i need to use it continuously for minutes or morei had to be sure that the accessories were available after purchase such as the filter which i was able to confirm with customer care its a good buy lets see in the long runits made in china the company provides months of an extended warranty if a review is given and shared with them this is a bit weird requirement to go ahead with however this isnt a sponsored review and is based on hardly a months usagesome photos are attached for helpnice product but the filter strain was teared in one place it needed to repair but otherwise satisfactory build quality is very deplorable they are just forcing the buyers to give star by any means to give better service and warrenty assistance by a card inside the box this seems really threatening but overall working of this machine is somehow oki would rather suggest if you have options to not choose it then go for that optiongood for surface cleaning build quality is not adequate but good to have at this price
3,average productsthis isnt useful for smoothies good for lassi or cold coffee that too was leakingnice for light fruitsnot continue worksoverall good but can blend only softer food or fruitsi am using this blender for weeks and now i must say its worth you money go for it i am college student and i usually make oatbanana milkshake for breakfast which to my surprise it did really good job in blending thembattery full charge will give you blendsbuild quality really goodso just dont think its perfect for college students go for itproduct is not good its very very worest item banana also not griding atleast nd charging issues battery is completed min and it will stops automatically
3,hi viewers so i bought this product after watching the endless hauls of amazonfinds as much as i was excited for the use of the product it did not prove to be as useful the sealing side does not heat enough for a packet to be sealed well the cutter side works fine but mostly the heating side has to be pressed upon so hard that the cell case opens up as it slides with the pressure of the thumb so i feel we can totally work without this product in our house its definitely stylish comes with a manual cells and a hook to hang it but the slipping cell cover fails my convinience with itgudeasy to use worth the moneywhen we press to seal lower part get open automaticallynot heating enamous power to heat and pack the plastic coverquality of the product is not good the hold and press part for heating and sealing is not consistent sometimes it seals sometimes it burns the plastic also the seal comes off of right pressure is applied so it is not reliable toothe sealer quality is too good and its sealing well the only thing is you hv to press it hard while sealingtakes only few seconds to seal an entire packet good when you are travelling with a toddler and carrying lots of snack packets pocket friendly and cuteaverage working
4,very good productonly thing i found lacking was quality of non stick should be little more bettergood to usenice but lock has little rust as shown in pictureperforms as expectedgood productits a light weight productgood product toasts well size also a little bigger comparatively to other products happy with the purchaseproduct is non sticky but not upto the markrs this is great purchase from amazon after four unsuessful or failed purchase finally this item get delivered to me before this i ordered four different items not this one which were of very low price for one minute but after my order and payment the order get cancelled automatically on the very next day but this time it get delivered i am very satisfied
4,like the product with decent looknewely installed now there is no issuebatter than buying k k branded ro just use yrs and buy a new one best hai switch should be there after water is filteredsatisfactory performancei have purchased this item weeks ago u have to call authorised technician to install the system as it is complex and cannot be fixed by local person also to check the tds the system work well although lots of waste water is been flushed out during the water purification
4,i take it my food habits in three weeks better resultlightgreat designeasy manouverabilityfast heatingwhat else can one want absolute go for productgo for itgoodsimple light and easy to use best at its pricetemperature control prits too light to handle and works good with this sole plate as dry ironthis iron box does the job its light weight and irons well
3,very short wire to connect to my switchnicevery good productgoodturns on heat initially and then doesnt heat up eventually needs to cool down completely to again start heating again wouldnt recommend buyingexcellent product pls buynice
4,very good product go for it and save for your moneynice productgood and easy to usegood work done with a whole familymust buy genuinely i would recommend this for boiling eggsit boils egg so fast and i wonder how does it peel so perfectly just on love with this it really makes my work easyalso i dont need vessels or cooker for boiling eggsit also boils the egg so fastlove to recommendit just boils in less then minutes every easy to use no need of much water and has an auto off option so dont have to keep and an eye on itreally love this productits a good product
4,it gives hot water but only after min of running which i feel a bit slow lets wait for years now to come up with its performancegood very goodi am already using liter of the same geyser but no issues till date good product one con very noisy like boiling watergood productthis is my second purchase ao smith geyser are amazing but sad to share that their techician are very rude and never came for installation so i had to get it installed from my own electrical personplease work on the technician part otherwise ao smith geyser is quick installments very easyi have been using this geyser for more than months it has been working great without any hiccups so far it heats the water pretty fast it stay in high rise and no issues due to high water pressure i have never tried its temperature control feature so no clue how it performs i have set it at max temperature and it meets my requirements buyers may go ahead buying this without a seconds thought
4,fan with perfect performance great air with no voice as in picture looking same months in using product good looking dust resistant only issue i think of its heavy by normal fan standard fans are easy to install but no remote control price is little high i think for this it should be around rupeesnice productproduct is good but colour is dull if colour is light then look really niceoverall goodcolour showing in app is not same in physicallooks classy
3,device was sturdy and handy suction power is quite strong all the attachments are good except the extension pipe was so weak that it gets crumpled when it comes in contact with any objecti bought this to get rid of dog hair on my bed and it does the job quite nicely it gets rid of dust very easily very handy and durable productthis is very strong so while that is good for certain things it can also be a little difficult to vacuum as the it sucks in the surface making it difficult to glide along the surfacealso it does heat quickly so you have to keep pausinghowever overall for this price its quite an amazing buya good product that cleans dust from upholstery and floors variety of attachments help for different surface cleaning good suction capacity long cord makes it more useful since you can reach greater distances from the plug point only reason for stars overall is that when using it some dust comes out from the collection compartment the closing seal could be made more firm so that there is no air leakage outeasy to suction the spider nest on the wall and other corner dustgreat product works great for the price it is coming for as usual it is not a heavy duty vaccum so that means it is will get heated up give mins break and useaffordable and easy to use fits the purposegood nice cozy machine easy to use and good looking
4,the product is working fine but at this price range there should be a temperature regulator we are always using silicon spatula but the teflon coating is coming off on its own product is functioning with in the described specificationscompactgood and reasonable easy to usethe machine is super easy to operate and use watt is hood enough and works fast as expected happy with the productvery good product all and every think is good only cord wire is very short so company have looki like to all features and service from i bell customer care service i can reffer to another person for buy this brandthe product is goodfollowing cons according to mecord length could be longerthe toaster doesnt closed fully which is something that should be mentioned in the product descriptionna
4,good servicegoodi like this producttaste is also good worth for money productoki am updating my review hope it will get published and the whos and who of the brand will pay attention to it after every two to three months the unit is having problem with the inlet system many a times the inlet stops taking water but the indicator shows tank filling it was rectified by the service person again now the indicator showing tank filling while the inlet valve is shut it should show the purple light means low or no pressure its a faulty unit the installation guy and the service persons were right who stated that the faulty and low quality units are sold online whose statement i ignored thinking that every offline seller says so alas i was wrong i want this unit to be removed immediately and want my hard earned money backat this price this product is very suitableesy to install
4,i bought havells lts instant geyser kw whiteblue and im really happy i made this decisionlet me start with why i went for instant geyser instead of storage geyserstorage geysers have a tank to store water and heat itfor example a litre storage geyser fills up the litre tank and then heats the wateras it has to heat high volume lts of water it takes time of about to minutesinstant geysers on the other hand heat water instantly within to minuteshowever the catch is they dont have a huge capacity tank which means at a given instant it has only small volumedepending on tank capacity of hot waternow who should opt for instant geyser and who should opt for storage geyser is the question if you like to have a shower bath for which you require more than litres of hot water continously then you should go for storage geyser since storage geyser of capacity more than lts will store lts of hot water and provide it to you as soon as you turn on the shower without any pausesinstead if we consider instant geyser of lts capacity for shower bath it cant provide you lts of hot water continously because for every lts it takes time to heat water againhence for a shower bath better to go for storage geysersif you like to have a bathtub bath then instant geysers are good to go becauseconsider using a bathtub a bathtub generally is of capacity ltsif you even use a storage geyser of high capacity as much as lts still you will have pauses of to minutes eachbecause at one shot this storage geyser can provide you only lts of hot water continously and then you will have to wait for mins for the next lts to heatso to fill the entire bath tub you need to have times lts of hot water ltsso the total wait time would be times mins on an average minsin this scenario of bathtub bath its better to go for instant geysers since they provide hot water almost instantly and eventhough there will be pauses for every lts of hot water still the pauses being very small youll have a bathtub full of water with enough amount of heathotnessthen you might ask what should we consider for bucket bath both storage geysers of lts or above and instant geysers of lts or above are good to gojust choose based on price time taken to heat instant takes less time energy consumption instant comsumes less now coming to havells lts instan geyser of kw why i bought this havells is a great brandi wanted to have it for bathtub bathkw heats lts of water in just to secondswhat i liked about this producti have been testing it from a week and it is really ossum as it is heating lts of water in just seconds i have used a timer to note that the installation was totally free however remember you will be charged if there is any plumbing work do be doneno need to buy any extra accesories like pipes everything is provided in the box you just need to buy a amp plug which would be less than rsas soon as the product was delivered by amazon i got a message from havells saying they have registered my installation request and the very next day the instalaltion was done thanks a lot havells this might differ for you based on your location i live in hyderabadi really like havells customer servicethe geyser comes with years of warrenty for the whole and yrs of warrenty on the tankit has auto cutoff feature to stop further heating or wastage of electricity if you forgot to switch off however please switch it off once done because eventhough it has auto cutoff still once the water in the tank cools down it will again start heating and the cycle repeats it shows color indication blue when its heating and orange when it has done heating have a look at the pictures i have attachednotego for the kw model if you want hot water instantly in to seconds the kw model might take to mins to heat lts of watermake sure it is kw model because i see reviews from other customers who say the mustard colored geyser is not kw but kw better go for white and blue color to be sure very nice productgood productkw rated heater is able to heat water in minutes and maintain that temperature for continuous flow of hot water good productgreat product at great pricevalue for money and instantly warm water comes in just minhavella water heaterwater heats up in secs depending on the weatherthis review is after using this water heater continuously for days in december in kolkata with one of the days being extremely windy and lowest temperature at degree celsius during afternoon early evening hours on the coldest day so far it took around min seconds to heat up completelyif you dont have chronic pain or arthritis or this is not going to be used for very old people whereby really hot water is required for bathing i think it can work perfectly for winters with lowest temperatures upto degrees because i have chronic pain and use this to get really hot water and for a shower not using a bucket and its manageableobviously cant be compared to steaming hot showers using a storage geyser but this heats quite quickly so can be used in the shower even with the low capacityfor that same reason it can be used for multiple people because by the time one person leaves the bathroom and the next enters youll have fully hot water only of lesser quantity so if you dont live someplace cold or dont need very hot water but mildly hot water this can be used for multiple people as wellinstallation support was also goodno cons only that if havells introduces a l instant heater in the kw range then that would be a game changer and might give storage geysers a run for their money because this is perfect for anyone who doesnt have their own home and might need to move around because its compact and provides instant hot water
3,good product received and i give you this full review after daysvalue for moneyeasy and handy to operatei received my frother machine its good for price and the motor is also good works well have different speed one can adjust as per requirement however i have received a different variant frother not as per images which is displayed but is working fine lets see now how many days it survives easy to clean and it makes quick froth can also be used for eggs i must say area of improvement would be selling details need to be update build quality area off improvement and the battery charging indicator as well should also show how much battery is remaining that feature is also missing in the variant i receivedcan purchase this product and can give it try for me its working doing the jobi ordered black one but get a white build is not good as i think easy to cleanit is indeed a good product the only thing that can be improved is speed adjustment buttons as it starts directly at the full speed you can reduce the speed but it should be in an increasing order speed buttonthe power adjusting buttons are greatfroths in only two minutes one charge can hold up to times od frothing totally worth the pricei ordered this product for beating coffee but this product is also best for mashing eggs lassi making and other kitchen works also great battery life and rechargeable in short time period

4,pros looking at the picture i thought it would just be the blender with some cap to cover the blade turns out the cap was actually a pretty nice container to blend small amounts of anything the container itself seems of great quality has measurements on the side and also comes with a lid so that nothing splatters outside when youre using the blender there is also a holder with some nails if you wanna mount the blender on a wall the blender itself is amazing to hold looks great and is pretty easy to use the blender can even stand on its own if you have to leave it and attend to something else if you place it vertically you can leave it as it iscons after over seconds of continuous blending that is if im not just pulsing it but continuously blending there is this smell of some sort that starts to come from the blender im not sure if thats a sign of overheating or if its normal theres this groove right above the blade and every time im done washing theres always a little residue that was hiding in that groove which always comes out a few seconds after im done washing and i always have to go back to clean that so thats a small inconveniencebut its overall great and id highly recommend getting this productgoodmaking the life easygreat durability and original productsvery nice product for small or moderate usagegood productvery goodvery useful product in day to day work

4,its very useful in winter when it gets cold and curd does not form properly it maintains fixed temperature enabling fermentation process i gave one star less because it does not have any handles so holding the apparatus can be tricky as it has this smooth surface so it might slip off from hands you have to be very careful while holding and handling this curd maker if they give side handles and autocut off feature then it would be bestpackage arrived in good condition now need to contact company for warrantygood product to settle hassle free yogurt only thing is it should automatically cut of power once yogurt is ready else yogurt tastes amazinggot the productlooks good checking nowi am writing this review after using the product for three weeks i have chosen this as agaro brand seems to be more trustworthy and has years warranty year months extra after registeringgood things it works as expected for my taste and local weather conditions it takes nearly hours this will vary based on individual taste and local weather conditions very light weight cleaning is easy and there is no problem even if there is a bit of spillnot so good things quantity is not liters it is few ml more than literplastic covers are delicate and there is chance of them getting damaged while cleaning in my opinion manufacturer should have a provided a optional spare set of coversconsidering the cost build quality is sufficient as it is made in chinalength of the wire is cms and usually requires an extensiongood productgood productits just amazing this sentence is enough to comment for this unique thingi never ever had ever imagined to make yogurt in quick time and even in winter without any compromise in taste

4,suction power mentioned no where on product spec or packaging but surprisingly its having good suction do most of the cleaning effortlesslyi purchase ltr version which having button to control suctionits some what true that suction reduced when dust cylinder is somewhat full but i resolved issue by emptying dust cylinder and cleaning filtersits somewhat tricky to remove cylinder itself for cleaning do it carefully ow u will break plastic locksits very similar to midea vaccum cleaner available in uk with kpaall extension pipes are of steel make is it difficult to work with due to weightbtw it dont have blower functionthe price of product and performance make it best buy vacuumits worth for the price givenand does its job perfectlyonly concernon my personal experience i had was the extension cord provided is made of steel and its bit heavy and we cant hold it for long while cleaning the spider webs in roofs rest all goodsuction power is okayish its a good product value for money but can do much better with a good suction power it doesnt remove most of the dust takes too much effortit is a good choice if you are looking for a vacuum cleaner under k it is worth for the pricenice product worth the moneysuction power is good cord length sufficient for home purpose noise level is also low right nowplease go for it it has excellent suction power easy to carry around and has different options for cleaning things good product for this pricevery usefull and comparatively very good when compared with costly vaccum cleaners in k dust cup is just awesomeonly drawback is no blowing out

3,overall heater is good but its size is small but it can make small area heat within few secondspower cord length very very short and function knobs have no written marking of the functionsmaterial used is not of a good quality no after sell service available at my locationthis room heater is portable and quiet efficient it warms my room perfectly it was really a good dealit is very useful and easy to handlesufficient heat is blowing with air very nice product in this price best to use for single person in office and home also not making noise like other productsi like it
3,its been just a week so yet to know the performance overall but till date its working finegoodgood qualitybattery capacity is very poor of powerproduct is fine but i was disappointed by seeing made in china lable on png version also seller sent lpg model first instead of png so check your model once received product is working fine seems to be working fine till now but very very poor service by bajaj servicemanhe came and just hanged the geyser on wall and said his work was limited to that onlywe had to call another technician on our own to complete the installation and do the plumbing workeven pipes cells did not come with the geyser and were sold by bajaj serviceman separately marks to bajaj for service

4,perfect for wintermeets all my requirementgood but expensive product with working processsince i have tried bajaj fins oil heater this fin heater is not worth it the quality is good just for the looks however the fins are very thin and unable to produce the same heat with same power as bajajalthough i am comparing it with bajaj fins still the room size was xft and borosil heater really struggled to even put the room to a comfortable temperature with bajaj it was done within half hour however borosil took even hrs and still we were feeling uncomfortablethe fan placement is low and it doesnt converts that much heat for faster heater even with max settingsplease check both physically if possible bajaj is on a heavier side and fins are of good qualitythough i received defective bajaj heater physical dent on body from cloudtail i have again ordered the same hope this time it turns out to be goodno company is providing the details of the oil quality used in their product good lucki have used bajaj oil filled heater before this feels more sturdy i think havells and borosil make the best quality oil filled heater in terms of sturdiness and finish although its a simple assembly but still i wanted to buy a good brand as it draws a lot of power and i was concerned about safetyit makes the room warm quickly based on the power mode you choose it will make the room dry i have seen people using water vaporiser alongside but on low power i havent felt too try in hours of useoverall since it was borosil i expected an even more beautiful look but since it works well i am happy easily k costlier than its peersusing rd party offbrand blowers for years i finally took the leap and bought the fin volcano from borosil it has transformed the way with its reliability and efficiencypackagingthe item was secured and packed very well with amazon packaging along with the original borosil packagingassemblyusing the provided guidebook was easy to understand the unit comes as assembled but you have to attach the castor wheels which was pretty easy then all was left was to plug it inusagethe heater warmed up the ftxft room with relative ease it has power levels for the fan attached and a temperature regulator the heater takes minutes to heat up and bring the room up to temperaturelooksthe product looks very well and the black fin structure helps meld well with any decor you have in your roomadditionally the twoyear warranty and the safety features make it a mustbuy product for winters would buy againdid not give the expected resultordered this ofr a month ago and have had used it since then it is a powerful product to warm up the room pretty quickly although the first few minutes are slow but then it picks up the pace and evenly heats up the entire room it is quite and doesnt even vibrate i already own an otg and an egg boiler and now the ofr borosil has stood up to the mark providing good quality appliances at a decent price tag
4,i have been using this geyser for almost two months it heats up the water in just minutes and quite power efficient uses almost half a unit for two person and if you leave it on for the whole day its around unit very power efficient and looks stylish in the bathroom and due to the form factor doest take much space go for it you get all the pipes and installation material in the box so no need to buy them separately which is the case in some other modelsi had option while purchasing this geyser havells vs this one i opted this one as this was cheaper then its havells counterpart but this geyser does not satisfies me at all the only pros is its heats up water very quickly but rest is all consi keep the know to maximum temperature but still the light does not move from orange to red even if i put on the geyser for hrs it does not holds hot water for long i have used recold ao smith even amica earlier they were not as quick as crompton but they used to hold hot water for long i have another havells at home whose light goes from green to orange to red to display water temperaturepaisa wasul haithe product is not that good just given star energy efficient but it takes more time to heat the water also dont holds hot water for atleast hrs temperature control also not so good after getting liters itself water becomes cold even if it is on from minim using ao smith geyser in our one room from five years no issue again purchased geysers for other two rooms one is ao smith and other is this crompton even though i spend more for this geyser im not satisfied better go for ao smith or racoldwaranty card are missingएक हम गजर म ज हन चहए व सब कछ ह सबस अचछ बत ह पवर आफ हन क बद भ गजर क टक म बच पन घट तक भ गरम रहत हgood product using since months working properly
4,my only concern is longevity so lets see how long this one lasts otherwise its quite quite useful especially during wintersgood looking but light weight not easy to cleannice producti bought this as it is made in india it is light weight which is good and does its job well the lid must be manually opened and must be pushed all the way up to hold initially it fell back but it needs to be push back to hold upright positionam happy with itafter using it for two daysexcept for the cord length of the kettle which should be a bit moreotherwise thank you for a good productvery nicegood workingheats well less noisy and looks elegant cord is short and partially opening lid makes it difficult to clean has worked well so far
3,good product and superb fast heatingas it was small tank if u need to get bucket water on geyser and wait till water gets heated mins on tap and fill bucket with hot water off tap and wait for another round of water heating then again fill bucket and leave the tap on untill bucket filled with warm water if u need more hot water repeat steps cons one need to purchase inlet outlet pipes which costs around as this was not provided by orientwriting review after days usuageheater is so slow as compare to bajaj heater currently i purchased this but its not goodi have ordered two of them installed in bathroom as well there is a trick to use it in bathroom either turn tap really slowly or by turning on tap at full sppeed whenever the the water get cold again switch of the tap after to minutes again on and fill just this compromise you have to make in place of storage geysersproduct body fitting is average be prepared to spend another rs on installation pipes a plug and installation charges no installation plate with geyser to be mounted on screws no safety valve supplied with geyser overall average product better go for havells which comes with all accessorieseasy to installtemprature controller is not available with this producttill date working good on th feb received as per delivery date on opening found that the unit is wrapped with plastic and found water droplets maybe they tested the product before delivery coming to the product it heats water to boiling temp in minutes and you can expect jugs of hot water onlydeliverypacking since no bubble wrap or anything to protect the productproduct you should not design a product with such low capacity now i am struck after buyinglookswill update more laterfirst of all this is not a storage geyser this is instant water heater so better to understand the feature before using it just switch it on and wait for min it will start supplying hot water as i told this is not a storage geyser like ltr it comes with lts capacity only with kva so once the set temperature reach then open the hot water tap in normalslow running speed so that it will continue supplying hot water warm water if the hot water tap will be fully opened with full speed then this instant water water will not get sufficient time to warm the water hope this review will be helpful

4,im really satisfied with this geyser im using this geyser for all my home purposei give to it average ratingnot bad but goodenergy efficientvalue for moneyproduct is good and experience has been goodafter installation of geyser for ltrs we are facing the voltage issue which occurred couple of times and was repaired instantly can anyone help me to fix this issue permanently regarding voltage issue due to geysertechnician has charged for connection pipes he told connection pipes wont come with this l modelenergy efficient and easy to install attains max temp in about mins from room temp value for moneypost purchase service is very goodelectrician from the company installed it very next day upon deliveryinstallation very fast
4,very niceefficiency is good cost is little more compared to its competitorsproduct quality is good but after sales support from lg local services center are grossly disappointing dont misread into the installation charges you will be in for a surprise with discrepancies on installation charges please ensure you check with lg installation service team before handproduct is good and no issues with cooling or any other functionalitythe installation was expensive amazon installation says tax but the total installation cost is tax stand cost others also the copper wire was missing and the lg installation person told that i need to contact amazon and they will reimburse i called amazon customer care and they said they will reimburse upto the wire costed me some amazon reimbursement is in form of amazon pay balance so i actually ended up paying cash as below to the lg installationinstallation cost wire cost total amazon should look into why copper wires are missing from packages it seems to be a regular issue as installation guys were aware of it even before opening the package it is unnecessary issue and headache for customer buying from amazongoodnoisy at full speed fan mode but quiet enough at medium to low fan speedcooling is good and features are more than enough for normal use room temperature display is useful remote is good enoughoverall no complainseverything is good and fine i love it
4,though i bought a pack of two after seeing the pictures and checking model i received only one compatible with my aquasure the other is different and not compatible with my unit so essentially my money for the other is wasted because the return window was overusing product regularlyeasy to installpoor quality doesnt stay more than month its kinda duplicateit is available in rs in csd but its not available there thats why we choose to buy it onlinebut its duplicate and very expensive hencenot satisfiedgive the address where we can buy it offlineonline also whats the warranty of this product mention itgoodits easy to useinstallation is difficult if you dont or cant understand the fitting procedure but once you do aokay and super easyimportant lasts me well over months but i recommend changing it after you think the flow of water has slowed down a lot or you think the water tastes funnyfor the last few days of its life the water will not be completely pure and it wont completely stopthis filter has a good water flow rate for a family of four it disperses enough water fast within minutes youll have several liters of water to drinkalso the main thing about this is it is chemical free it also filters out viruses take a look at who recommendation if you fold a cloth ten times over and pour water over it it can filter out cholera virusi would recommend this to all home owners since i got this cartridge delivery i didnt need to run to the storereally liked the product but amazon packing is really made me disappointed really broken a trust on amazon filter kits were completely separated from the box cause the external box was too small and made the filter kits squeeze completely i just pulled the filter kits to get its normal size please amazon dont do this kind of weird packing atleast pack in a approximate box not this kind of flat huge box thank you
2,it is broken and it is not useful please change this productproduct is so so the plastic quality is not so good as per the priceit claims that it can be stuck in the metallic areas like fridge but the magnet is not workingthe first one was not working and the replacement was sent without box with a used piece the battery had water while i received it and even the delivery person was shockedthis is marvellous product to use such a small product but does wonders and that too given batteriesgreat product and lovely packagingi dont like it the product it not workingnot satisfied

3,after days uts tubes not workingwaste of moneyfuse earlythe item is nice light weight and good to use the only issue is crude finish the grill is coming off from sides the reflector surface is bulging out and appears that it may break with heat i requested for replacement but e mail sent to me says you will refund me the money after receiving the item this was not the arrangement kindly replace the item with one which is free of defects in cold conditions of hills in uttarakhand i would like to use this item kindly give your views on my point so that i am prepared to receive defect free item from you and i return this onesleek body and the colour and only product of three rods with two year warranty light weight too and beautiful stand and can be rotatedvery good option in this range working efficiently and giving good temperature to my room one of my friend using this product for last years without any problem good point is that it does not gives any smell as other blower givesone suggestion increase power cord length by inches so that we can use any whereitem broken after some time customer care not picking the phone even a single callwas very useful in the record breaking winters this yearyou have up to levels of heating this is the best part the only thing is that the light gets too bright so as to hurt your eyes but this is the issue with all such heater
3,thought it would be enough to warm room and passage but its heating fan is so small even room heating took hours to warm they have btc but it doesnt help to warm quicklyit is a good product and this month i bought pieces the last one looked like a used and refurbished heater the wheels provided with the heater are old and worn out they do not rotate smoothly and there is difficulty in moving the heatera quality product which will keep you warm not heating well it works but radiation of heat is very low i have other radiator heaters like havells venus which hear comparatively much more for same power consumption will not recommend purchasing this surprised from this brand as kenstar is usually a good brandused for season good quality the only issue was humidity in room on long usage hours continued power onliked very good in operating easy to usenot getting heatkept hr but no luck waste this
4,i installed it myself in my kitchen and it is very usefulgoodheating of water good but water become so hot u cant put your hand in it if it mixes the cold or running water with the hot water it will be good or water temperature can be adjusted it will be greatthe product is very good easy to install and easy to use the water spray jet is also good with movebale outletwater comes out either hot degree centigrade or cold same like your water tank temperaturei thought i will getting mixed water as there is no provision of controlling the temperature always the water is more hot that you even cannot put your hand and if you bring the knob towards cold it immediately cools down so it is either hot or cold not botheven if you slightly move the knob towards the hot side within sec the temperature rises to degree centigrade from degree centigradewas expecting a reostat to control the temperaturenot able to use for the required purpose for kitchenpls do not purchase this items water does not get hot at all you reduce or increase water pressure its biggest weakness that there is no option to increase the temperature or last one its price totally worth lesswonderful product in this segment and value added product for home during winterthe water gets extremely hot when given in hot mode and quickly gets cold when cold water option is switchedideal should be like geyser it should have the option for both hot and cold water running parallelly so that a nice warm water flows and things get doneone cannot wash dishes with hand when water is very hot or very cold
4,its easy to use and amazing product by amazonthank you waffles came out nice crisp the product did a great job rather than spending high bucks on branded ones like borosil or prestige i would recommend this waffle machine its value for money for single waffle maker this is bestthe product is worth buying if you like making waffles in the breakfast or give a new texture to the sandwiches you makeits become a daily part of our kitchen its cute easy to use and clean can make a range of waffles sweet or savoury i like to cook each waffle twice till its more crispy absolutely go for it makes a great gift tooconvenientnot giving it stars as there was no measuring cup as promised otherwise i successfully made a very cute yummy wafflebeen on my bucket list for a long time after seeing shivesh video kinda promotion actually i decided to buy for my daughter on her bday very easy to use n to clean as well but takes time to bake but maybe thats how it is with any waffle maker i dont know but for beginners its a good buyvery good however size is small
3,best performance i buy it twicereally best for medium roomwithout power plug deliverednever expectedits small and body is also poor qualitydamigdurabilitythe product is durable and value of moneyits very good product in this rangethe quality is good and the air blow output is best
4,i like itits a good investment to always be accurate about the grams in your purchase but its comparative small in size so its not good for ambitious individualsgood accuracy but if someone wants more higher accuracy eg grams this product might not work for themniceek bharosemand aur nice product goodniceeasy uselight weightcomes up with battery
3,thik hairecommend for youriturn my product it is brokeni like the product but the wire is too smallmetal used is too thin in thickness as it was dented while delivered and same was rectified with bare handscord was also smaller in length but overall in this price range not much expectedvery niceso far so good it gets a bit overheated i hope the base does not melt or get over heated have only used it once when the performance was extremely satisfying will have to wait and seeproduct was good and value for money
4,its been days of using this product heating is quick though it caters only half of the bucket thats expected in l quick delivery i read the reviews earlier so i opted for local electrician to install i had the accessories of previous geyser saved my moneyonly issue i am facing is indicator there are two lights red light is not glowing since the purchase what is with that i am confused apart from that its good to go for a family of even in wintersits very useful for getting the hot water instantly its very comfortablewater becomes hot in no timeperfect best gyser dont know about energy saving becinstall just now but performance wise bestgood one for regular use energy consumption found little more good option among instant geyserlikedproduct and performance is very goodworking fine from last month flow pressure is low so not able to use shower i need to install pressure motor for shower using within second hot water come
3,this product of yours company is heating liters of water in minutes its wastage both electricity and moneyvery bad quality of wire and rodthe product is just ok but the quality is a bit low but you cant expect a premium at this costvery fastergudnicenicecord length is too small
4,the steel quality could have been better but it is adequate the second major problem is that neither the upper nor lower container has a handle and so when you try to open them after minutes they are still hot making it difficult for children to operate it the flavour depends on the coffee you use we use genuine south indian chennaimade coffee bean powder so the aroma is fantastic but that has nothing to do with this particular product because any authentic filter coffee will have the best aroma i can return the product very easily but for such small cost product that doing so would put the supplier in loss due to the cost of the return courier so even though it would be difficult to use without a handle i wont rather buy some better onegood quality easy to use and wash is bit expensive for ml capacity rs available with same graded steel very good detailed literature with the product txmy husband used it he can cook much well it was easy for himgood productgood product to buy if you are far from southern statesquality seems to be good till nowno unusual stains or withering of enamelfiltering action is consistent with designi got rusted piece material quality is just upto the mark worth it if the price is under rs size is enough for or cups of coffeevery thin steel has been used to make thisexcellent
4,the quality of coffee maker is excellent a dm very ease on making coffee and getting served hotthe silver color is much better compared to stainless steel finish lov my coffee made in this this should be advertised as suited for cups not does the job well and even after placing directly on the stove there is no discolouration steel quality is upto marki have been using this product for a while and have no complaints makes amazing filter coffeelooks and quality are at par with other brands in its price bracket in function this kind of a mokapot design is flawed at the cleaning aspect including this particular model in my observation in it the pressured boiling water pushes through the coffee powder in bulk together thus rendering the flavour inferior to what is brewed otherwise when the water percolates little by little secondly the portafilter type coffee powder container positioned just above the boiler chamber sends some dissolved coffee back to the boiler water through the upward pressure pipe rendering the entire remainder water mixed with coffee go waste thirdly the coffee powder containers gasketted mesh is sedimented too while filtering the forced brew upward so when a person like me thinks of preparing a brew in a mokapot like mechanism the very thought of the predicament of dismantling the the tiered chambers separating the gasket and then wash the pot thoroughly because coffee is lurking everywhere therein to cause unhygienic residues dampens my desire to go for it i am no debater if the idea is to leave the pot just rinsed and washed and not rid it of the residues all this is not the case with the downward filteration method of the other types of coffee machines that are absolutely unmessy no offense meant for any system this is my personal opinioni like the convenience of making coffee for people in one goits very easy to clean it up after every use its rust free and looks beautiful while kept on kitchen counter even idlylike and good productordered this for my stay in india it worked the way it should be it has silicone washers easy cleaning product quality can be improved ok product not wow
4,good quality easy to usenicevalue for moneyvalue of moneygood filter im using for kent roits an excellent product at this price i used to call the ro service guy for changing the sf ro guys charged ne for candle and for service charge so in total i was paying for changing the sf this konvio sf i got at per piece and i got sf changing tool from local market now in th of price i am abke to change the filter by myself and most importantly the outcome is same the quality of water is same as before so no downgrade of water quality i really recommend this productproduct quality is good and easy to install

4,an easytouse coffee filter at a reasonable pricevalue for money fit and finish is goodgood for glasses of filter coffeei am relishing the original filter coffee taste in north indiai give it stars as it is the same as shown and good and easy to usei mostly have instant coffee but this time i bought some filter coffee from araku valley during my visit i was not aware of the process that you cant have it like the normal coffee so i tried it like normal one and it failed miserably because the coffee seeds wont get dissolved there is no coffee smell in it then i went online to understand the process where i came to know about this coffee maker i bought it for cup coffee which cost me you can get bigger one also for or cup you can go through the process of how to make south indian filter coffee online to me it does job very efficiently and finally i am able to have a good cup of filter coffee now about the product its not premium quality steel but its a decent one and its very easy to use you fill the filter in morning and you can have the raw extract till night so to me its a value for money if you want to try filter coffeethe press doesnt work perfectly but does the job size is small you can only make one cupthe steel quality is world class gives a proper filteration

4,this neat lightweight device responds without delay no waiting with the button pressed and counting seconds before a figure is displayed a single tap is all it takes to change measurements start up or switch off this sleek beauty can weigh something as light as gm provided the substance is placed directly on the plate great if accuracy and speed are what you needgood productgood one got on a affordable price quality is good definitely would help for planning luggages for overseas travelnice cute scale looks good in kitchen does its job perfectlyamazing product with perfect and accurate weightsi had seen an amazon brand kitchen weighing scale and every time i was about to order it was out of stock and now that i found this i did no hesitate and ordered it for i am sure if i had waited for some sale period i wud have got it for but didnt want to take a chanceas ive checked the scale the following things are good accuracy tare function light weight ease to use large backlit display stainless steel basewhat cud have been better a hook or a hole to hang it on the wall the weighing platform is slightly elevated from the base and possibly debris rubble can stay in between where its slightly difficult to clean with cloth will have to use some kind of small brushoverall my recommendation is to blindly go for it and is really worth the price durability is yet to proven which only time aging can provethanks amazon and sellerdont go for or rs product if u gonna use it for long run more than month this is the best product to buyit works fine light weight and accuraters product might show you incorrect reading like gm and doesnt last more than monthit is working well good product

3,easy and quick heating price is best in class year month additional warranty on registered device is very good in class best product for those who uses occasionally times in year because it will last for years if use is limitedoverall very good productis better automatic but heating temparature is not good manual is goodproduct works best and quick just its quite light weightoverall the sandwich maker is good the length of the power cord is not sufficienteasy to prepare sandwiches of any thickit is a very good product decent cord length the grill marks on my sandwiches and panini come out excellent value for money is good considering i bought this for inr its totally worth the spent you can make one sandwich panini at a time but i only cook for myself so i dont find any issue with that but again it depends on the size of the sandwich go for itvery nice product ideal for small kitchen needs very light weight w power capacity get heated very quickly i say only one drawback powercord length is really very small it should be longer atleast metre to metre would be ideal otherwise its a great productthe best thing i like about this is the facility of big sandwich maker in a small size there is no other company offering this design in this size very good thanx
3,very small it is hardly for less than heavy clothesvery good for single person but not for family too small for home use good for travelvalue for moneyi like the productvalue for moneynice productim happy with the product as its highly portable due to its folding ability into its pouch and its sturdy enough to stand on its own but size is smaller than i expectedmaterial is not good for these price you can buy any bagone of the bag is damaged but overall product is good
3,the only issue is that the built quality is very poor it broke on nd use rest the adhesion is goodthe product is not sturdy the handle broke after a weekthe adhesive is working but it is too diffuct to peel the tapeproduct is okay but the stick is very delicate so it broke now it very difficult to use the productthe handle of the product broke when i used it second time so its very poor quality would not recommendits value for moneyeasy to useproduct of good use wish the handle of the roller was easy to usewe have a beagle dog so we have extensive use of lint rollers in the household have been using the m but its very expensive if you consume to rollers every month so thought of trying this one as i though how bad can a lint roller be the stickiness of the glue paper was good enough to remove the dog hair but the quality of the handle is really bad it did not even last days so ended up using a wooden stick or long pencils for the job if the makers had spent some more on making a good handle even if the cost would have been rs higher then it could have been a great product especially for those households which have pets as they need it more frequently so i might go back to buying the m product of look for something in between

4,gooddont wait to juice your fruits from sujata this variant is powerful and effortless just that it is delicate to calibrate the juicer to the motorsumit juicer mixer grinder is a very powerful and useful machine for my daily usebest qualityi liked so muchactually very tough machine made life much easiercleaning the juicer sieve is little tough but then thats true with all machinesa good purchase for entire home purpose but juicer assembly is not much easy i thoughtthe juicer is good for every day useonly thing the noise of the juicer is too high
4,everything is niceincluding design functionworks as intended and mostly as descriptionbut here are things that couldimprovedthe upper lid should be able to open up a bit more to the back if we want to wash it more thoroughly since having lid not open in a way that it goes a bit back enough for the lid to not feel a bit in the way its not as comfortable as it could be this shouldnt become a point which should make ppl avoid buying it though since many other models seem to open up till the same angle as this one does unless you found one that opens up more than this one if you already bought it or still want to buy it you can use a big bottle brush to scrub it even tho your hand can go in but you ll feel like you have to be more careful while washing to not accidentally hit the lid you can see from my imageproduct imagerest of the body seems sturdy but the handle feels a bit lighter than the body so it makes me wonder if handle would fall off due to daily strain when i pick up the kettle by handle alone may be it wont breakcome off but i hold the kettle with both hands on both ends just in case to be safe these are two things i d like to be improved if agaro makes any changes in the model features in futurei didnt return it though because chances are other models are the same or similar and apart from all that it works well so yeahvery good kettle and big in sizecord length is goodit is very robust in temperature control that is to say on and off manual and automatic off regarding cord it is watts kettle which is on the top of ordinary indian domestic non power a plug they have given one meter quality wire with a plug this means if your home wiring can stand watts on ordinary non power plug you can use it in any socket anywhere the switch in the kettle is bit wobbly not sure whether it is purposely designed so initially i was not pleased now love it because of majestic performanceproduct looks good value for moneyseems good until now hope will last long good purchase kettle is nice and cord length is also good but package is not goodat the time of delivery it was opened
4,i gifted it to my mother last month it was like love at first sip easy to use easy to clean easy to flex a blessing for any indian adult still new to french press coffee so i used south indian filter coffee for the past few weeks and could instantly feel the difference between a cup of freshly pressed coffee and one of instant coffee although i have been advised to try grinding my own beans for optimum enjoyment i seep my grounds for around minutes after heating the press for around a minute or so with hot water and am amazed at how heatresistant the glass is i would however still advise taking precautions the markings inside also provide a great measurement of how many cups i would end up making not only have i used it for making coffee but also to froth milk and to make tea attaching photos of a coffee i made using this french press with a layer of frothed milk ngl one of the favorite purchases my family made am thoroughly pleased and highly recommend it to anyonetime saving coffeefilterbeen using this for many months now and its great love that it has line measurements only thing is i wish the top surface had an arrowtype bump on the plastic to point where the holes are you so you dont have to look down but you can just tell by touchdelivery amazon delivery is always reliable and it didnt fail me this time toopackaging both outer packing and the product packaging were intact product packing had the right information and was very usefulproduct very compact we used several coffee makers in the market but all required electricity to run we wanted to have a non electric one which we can easily carry for outdoor and this one fits aptly to our requirements just add the coffee powder and hot water after a while when we press the central pipe coffee comes out the nozzle makes it convenient to pour it a cupfor this price in great india sale i think its worth i am inclined to give star but reserving star now will use it for a month and come back here to change my rating if it still satisfies megood one for a black coffee loververy very happy with cafe jeis french press it has become an important part of my daily ritual now in past days easy to use and maintain and would recommend buying without hesitationinstruction manual could have been a hard copytoo much steps to get the ebookgot this french press last year and another one few days back one for coffee another for green black teatotally value for money the built is solid and filtration is on pointsuper happy
4,purchased this last month its good as working fine for me size is bit small but you can easily toast normal breads at one go just make sure you fill same amount of stuff in both sandwich so that both gets heat properly from both side cord is bit small but its good if you have plug near your kitchen at first use it smells like wire is burning but after next usage that smell will not appear cleaning of the product is bit difficult as you cant wash directly under tap you need to use clean cloth with wetted with water you can use some liquid soap but make sure it gets cleaned with clean cloth apply some butter or ghee on both side of bread before making sandwiches else it will stick to your plates in grilloverall goodit is ok but does not look sturdy enoughthe top and lower heaters are not parallel if the sandwich is a little thicka little better design would have avoided this problemmakes the breads go crunchy from soft would recommendvery nice easy to use except there is no temperature control knob i like my sandwich more crisperquality is good and easy to use received in hoursproduct is good i post review after months from purchasesufficient for to family memberi suggest go iteasy to use and easy to cleannot bad at all issues the hook is on one side so if your sandwich is a bit bulky then the upper half may be tilted and loose on one side the hook is also flimsy so there is a risk of breaking

4,i like the price where it comes and the features it offers but one thing i dint like is its plastic fan can cover the quality of the plastic used to give protection is very light due to which it can break easily so we have to carefully lift the product the cost cutting is done in plastic buildover all the product is fineconcern for inlet pipe folds hampering the water flow foam container too small so contains half water half froth must do something for this considering customersthe product is working fine as expected and the pressure is also good for in house cleaning purposes like two bikes and two carsrecommend product the inlet pipeblue color quality is not up to the markand also reset button is missing on the product i received but later i contacted the customer care and found out that i received an updated version and it doesnt need reset buttonthe warranty period of months is too short for such an itemhigh noise and machine heating to highonly bucket filter are missingplease send me the bucket filter only immediatelyi dont wont to return as soon as possible send me bucket filter only i like this machinesend me replythnk ueveryone shd have it its not only to clean your or any vehicle even you can clean washroom flooring in minutesgood product best under k
4,ok okquick heat and auto cutaveragea very good product easy to handle easy to clean can bill water as week as milk cord is little shortsteel quality is very good you can buyquality itemi think that the thin plastic lid may get broken someday you cant open the lid singlehandedly and it isnt easy to clean it due to its designer shape on the inside also i think the base coating will also fade soon normally after a few months of usage you can see the area of coil heating directly when water boils in my case i can see that just a few days after purchaseoverall i wanted a l kettle with a big lid so my major purpose was fulfilled it is just that i find it of low quality than expected

3,not much durablecannot close propergreat for storage the product is as advertisedboth sides of the bin tend to bulge out when clothes are inside hence the lid might often slip inside the bin the both sides need some support to keep it sturdy so that the lid stays in it placethe material is flimsy and cardboard is not strong the side latch or handle stitched is not the strong a box cant hold the weight when its full cheap price cheap valueappears to be very weakmay get damaged with in a few days of usagehence returned ittoo early to question its durability however it looks sturdy it is bit different from the product image as you can see in my pictures the entire top isnt designed as projected thats a bummer good for small families onlygood product
4,it was goodok with the priceit depends on the dough you preparewith little practice we can make pluffy rotisonly thing is we cannot touch the steel part of the roti maker while preparing rotisthe steel part gets heated upso we have to carefully deal with it without touching the steel partother concern isit is inches onlyfor making alu parathas like that if the size was bigger than it like inches like that then it was more easy to make stuffed parathasits worth to have roti maker with you cooks fast rotis and all depends on practice i cooked methi parathes too and were good i found parathes was much good in roti makeri am lazy its me and my husband here for two persons rotis making i found its much easy it should have in each kitchen if you have atta maker also than making rotis are not much hurdle for roti maker dough must be soft and atta maker makes soft dough too so must have both than your rotis will be goodi like the productfor one person it was hard to make dough pressing and cooking now by this chapati maker everything become easyextremely good value formoney clear instructions and easy to usegood for making parathas more than rotisits an excellent product kids and males can also easily use it really the best value for money dont even think for any other brands just go for for libra chapati maker truly gathering guests is no more tension

4,the material of bigger measuring cups is a bit thin so feels like cheaper quality the material of the smaller measuring spoons is thick and good quality the edges of the handles for the cup sizing are way too sharp if you are into regular cooking of variety items go for itgood to buyi bake cakes for that needed measurements this gave cheaper price with good quality with my purchasegoodno brainer good product for the purpose involvedit is good for price atleast not plastickits steel

3,the iron had water still inside it the plastic clips were half opened and the box looked like it was opened the amazon box was intact just that product box was taped up expected to get a new product and not a renewed item if i knew i was buying a renewed item i wouldnt have paid full price good productthe product is good but not for steam iron water dripping outside of the iron box wetting the cloththis product is easy to use as no problem of wire and works fine and take more time remove wrinkles w is not enough for cordless design quickly looses heat while usage takes time to re heat you often end up waiting for the unit to get reheated corded design is better for w range models though this has continuous steam option this drastically reduces the usable time and once you return the unit to base excessive water dripping issues can be noted condensed water flows down the base to the table user manual does not cover all necessary detailsoverall this is not a well designed product not happy with real life usagenice producttemperature drops down very fastsocket of the holding station seems loose sometime need to press down hard on the holding station
4,my review of using new vacuum mop pro for days the product is a bit tricky to setup with the app and you have to follow youtube videos to get it setup i wish xiaomi provides video tutorial links in their user manuals they dont mention it but we need bluetooth and wifi connection to be setup for the app and robot to work together this tip is missing in user manual wifi connectivity does get lost sometimes but that is because my router is far from certain places in my house that time the robot needs to be brought back to the wifi range ghz connection does not work with this model the robot takes anywhere between minutes to completely vaccum my sq ft house battery life is really good in the new model or more is still left after one complete sweep or mop cycle of my house charging is also not bad it took hrs for it to charge full the first time couple of times it got confused in a specific area in my house and i had to reset the entire house map for it to work properly again once the map was created and the device has sweeped and mopped that area for a couple of times it would not repeat this behavior dusting is of a quality each time the amount of dust collected is staggering we never knew we had so much dust in our house mopping is average i would call it light wiping and not mopping hard stains or sticky stains or dry stains are not affected by the mopping only light dust or weak stickiness gets wiped out adding a bit of floor cleaning liquid or vim liquid in the water helps vacuum mop mixed mode is limited in its effectiveness in this mode mopping sometimes wets the floor and causes dry dust to stick to the floor which the vaccum is not able to pick upi recommend vacuum and mop as two separate cycles keeping mop extension attached to the robot all the time causes mopping cloth to accumulate dirt and when it gets dragged along the floor it causes wet dirty mop to be wiped around the house this is not ideal so its important to remove that extension from the vacuum bot when you are only vacuuming and not mopping the mop works horribly on door mats main door or bathroom mats it gets very dirty when it moves over mats and then that wet dirt spreads all over the place so please remove all the mats esp during mopping session noise levels are pretty low in medium mode sometimes we dont even know where it has gone it gets so quietpros battery life suction power noise levels vacuumingcons mopping is average its at best can be called as light wiping setup is bit tricky user manual is insufficient xiaomi does not contact or send any demo person at home you have to figure it out using youtube videos i can see old people or non tech savvy people will highly struggle with this thing once the device is confused it doesnt correct itself automatically it needs a map reset door mats make the mop even dirtier so please remove them or other items on the floor before moppingsuch tips nobody gives you and you have to learn them on your ownbut i still recommend this device as it is very effective in sweeping the dust in the house cleanprosfor cleaning dust it is very good we can set daily scheduleeven if we forget to do so it will automatically does the work by setting schedule cleaning the box after its work is also not very hecticbrushes are providingwe can set restricted areasconesmost of the hairs n threads are stuck through the round main brush little difficult to clear the brushit has been more than year iam using thisone time the movement is low when icheckedso many hairs are stucked in its wheelit was little difficult to clear the hair strandsmopping it is average onlyonly takes very little amount of waterso oily things will remain in the flooronce or twice in week we have to do mopping with plenty of water and lizolit cant reach the sharp corners alsoonce we create restricted areaby the time of using it couldnt detect the proper area we markedso it enter those area and get stuck most of the timesit is main thing i hate about this productremaining things are okaythen we have to reset the map and set restricted area againit is bit annoyingoverall it is very good for memy brooming is almost completely replaced by this once in week i do the complete cleaning with broom to all areas that didnt covered by this machine in all other aspect like price batteryapp feature suction and cleaning its really very good producti find it very useful and nice to have productso will directly make note of some drawbacksimprovent area i observed sometimes it gets confused or leaves a specific section of bedroom even though there has been no obstacle its little noisy or i will say not a silent thing in standard suction power though that with any vaccuum cleaner xiaomi could have provides extra hepa filter with it vaccummop doesnt clean properly and rather sticks dust to floor because of wet brush so i do vaccum and then only mop subsequently is best option charging is super slow if compared with any mah battery with mobile fast charger its times slower despite such a big docking chargeri am a bachelor and i do not like maid coming to my housethis solves the purpose it is great at vacuuming my sqft house it can do it on turbo mode with dual cleaning in single battery life was surprised with the vacuum power and battery life it collects way more dust than the manual broomingit can skip corners and narrow places once in a while i just broom the corners and bring the dust in the middle before turning the robot on for navigation and room mappingmopping is equally bad mop does not cover whole area and it leaves trails it leaves the floor looking worse than the un mopped floor also water tank broke in just few cleaningsrecommended for vacuuming purposevery good product very helpful product in my homewe purchased the product in april and now it is not workingafter charging it is running for less than one minute and getting stoppedeasy to use and working well little bit of noise is there but acceptablehelping hand more reliable than maids does the job well once in days you need to mop yourself good suction power

4,cost effective this is good for heating your personal self and you will need to sit next to it over hours it will heat up a big room the auto switchoff does work very light i would have loved if the cord has a bit longerits light weight and convenient to use but the jali gets heated need to work on it to make it remains cool like havellsfinebe ready for increased rs electricity bill monthly in winter during this device usea bit costly otherwise better than the competitionuseful for very small room only and consumes lot of energy doest blow heat too far very less heatdoesent heat room properly it is not able to hear my small sized room i think you should go for rod heating heater

4,cord is small and sound while heatingwell built and the buttons have a smooth positive feel to the action the kettle heats efficiently and does exactly what it was designed to do and does it very well well worth the extra cost highly recommendexcellent this is better than expected easy to use really fast nd above all its safe the length of the cord is okay if you have dedicated spot the vessel or else a half foot more will be better and comfortablei can recommend this to allwire length is very smallproduct quality is excellent using the same model for the past yrs without any issues we use it for boiling water we boil the water for drinking and for making tea we use the kettle atleast or times a day an twice in a day we boil water with its full capacity so we boil water or cups to full capacity everydayrecently the lid got detached so purchased a new one with the same capacity and model to my surprise the kettle comes with bigger plug for which we dont have suitable socket hence returned the product and received refund promptlythere is no mention of the plug size in the product description i give star to the product and wish to buy again only if it is provided with a plug hope philips takes note of thisadvice please use it only for boiling water and there will be no trouble works for years the kettle opening is not so wide compared to some other makes but that will not be an issue if it used only for boiling water as intendedchord length is less product is worth
