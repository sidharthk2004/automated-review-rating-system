REVIEW,rating
even without the endgame content temtem is worth a look for anyone who has enjoyed a pokémon game in the last twoandahalf decades especially those who have wanted a steeper challenge to go along with their critter collecting its a familiar imitative experience in so many ways yet we came away satisfied with just about every tweak made to the wellestablished formula sure the main quest becomes a bit of a slog and yes the nintendo switch does struggle to keep up at times despite these qualms temtems engaging battles enshrine it as one of the most innovative additions to the genre in recent memory,1
splatoon is more of the same but refined to borderline mechanical perfection its the most fun weve had with an online shooter in years and for series veterans it makes splatoon feel entirely redundant for all but its unique singleplayer content it feels like the development team has solved every problem the splatoon community was bleating on about and then fixed some more that we didnt even realise were problems until they were fixed theres nothing revolutionary about it compared to its predecessors and its perhaps missing a big new idea that you might expect after five years but splatoon is the pinnacle of the series and the pinnacle of shooters on switch,2
while you wont find an evocalibre fighting game here depthwise jojos bizarre adventure allstar battle r is miles ahead of your typical darena anime fighter affair it would be a hard game to recommend to someone unfamiliar with the franchise as without the fan service aspect youre left with a basic fighter with some barebones modes however for those who adore jojo its an excellent example of how to do fan service right and one where you can feel the love and adoration of the franchises year history flowing through every part of the package,1
pacman world repac isnt a game that wed suggest you rush out and buy at once but it does a good job of reviving a decent d platformer for modern audiences tight controls lots of collectables and enjoyable level design ultimately outweigh minor performance hiccups and a general lack of imagination if you dont consider yourself a fan of platforming or pacman nothing here is going to change your mind and wed suggest you pass if you like classicstyle d platformers pacman world repac will absolutely prove itself worth your time even if it doesnt impress like the best in the genre,1
tmnt the cowabunga collection is indisputably the best thing konami has released in a long while meeting all expectations and then some bar absent difficulty settings for the arcade games its an anthology that finally gets it totally right digital eclipse and konami have done the fans justice offering a comprehensive library that doesnt hide content behind a paywall while going above and beyond in terms of features and bonuses with online functionality and rollback netcode being the icing on the cake this is now the gold standard for retro collections capcom pay close attention,1
ultimately wave of mario kart deluxe doesnt quite knock it out of the park we know weve been bashing these courses left right and centre but when it comes to mario kart we have pretty high standards you know however none of the tracks on offer are straightup bad most of them just feel like bside filler when compared to the main tracks created specifically for mario kart theres still a great deal of fun to be had here particularly when you crank up the difficulty to cc we have to keep reminding ourselves of the bigger picture too weve now got sixteen new courses for mario kart deluxe and were not even halfway through yet weve still got a ways to go,2
digimon survive is one of the best visual novels to come out so far this year with plenty of heart and tension to carry you through to the final act fans looking for an engaging story with wellwritten and presented characters that deal with lifeanddeath situations will enjoy the ride while players focused on the combat will probably find that the game comes up short despite its sluggish padded start digimon survive is well worth the long wait,1
xenoblade chronicles is a genuine masterpiece and the highlight of monolith softs superb series thus far theres an emotionallycharged and surprisingly edgy epic to get stuck into here a sprawling and hugely engaging narrative populated by a cast of unforgettable characters thats backed up by some of the very best combat weve had the pleasure of getting to grips with in this genre to date over hours into this one were as captivated now as we were when we first booted it up and it has more than delivered every bit of the adventure emotion and action that its key art promised it might aionios awaits its time to seize the future,2
live a live has been well worth the long wait this remake reintroduces an influential unique jrpg to the wider world with aplomb with a cacophony of different gameplay styles music and visuals that somehow hang together beautifully despite looking like octopath traveler and perfecting the hdd visual style youd do well to remember that this is still a super famicom rpg with many of the frustrations that come with s rpgs still intact in this remake still we admire that square enix decided not to change too much with this remake instead delivering an authentic and faithful update to the game that the majority of players outside japan missed nearly three decades ago this is a piece of gaming history we have loved getting to experience for the first time,1
make no mistake klonoa phantasy reverie series is the best way to currently play these two platforming classics and namco has done a decent job of presenting these titles in the best possible light with around hours of dreamy retrostyled platforming contained in this package klonoa veterans and younger platforming fans will find lots to love in the whimsical worlds and puzzleplatforming level design on offer here some performance issues aside its tough not to fall in love with this duology catch it when you can,1
wreckfest is one of the more impressive switch ports weve seen taking a game that already had performance issues on more powerful hardware and delivering a relatively stable version with reasonable loading speeds and all its debrisflinging carnage fully intact handheld play is a little less visually acceptable and the switch tax rears its ugly head again but just like the roughandready roadsters in the game we ultimately had a great time behind the wheel,2
ai the somnium files nirvana initiative is one of the most interesting visual novels weve played through in a while the murder mystery at its heart is brought to life by some great writing and quirky characters alongside the satisfyingly integrated beautifully balanced psync puzzle elements even with some minor control issues there is a lot to love in this game even if you never picked up the original highly recommended if youre even a little bit curious,1
fire emblem warriors three hopes is a thoroughly entertaining mashup of musou mayhem strategy and relationshipbuilding aspects that should more than satisfy fans of both the franchises involved here it improves upon its predecessor in several ways most notably in providing a far more engaging story featuring a narrative thats ripe for several replays with impressively solid performance on switch and an actionpacked campaign thatll see you blasting your way through tens of thousands of foes for a good hours in a single playthrough this is right up there with the very best omega force has served up thus far,1
demon slayer kimetsu no yaiba the hinokami chronicles is a very solid action game presenting a gripping story and thrilling action combat alongside an art style that almost perfectly matches the popular anime though combat can sometimes feel a bit shallow and the performance isnt always perfect wed still give this one a strong recommendation even to those who dont have any background with the anime or manga,1
mario strikers battle league is a masterclass in competitive game design what it lacks in options is more than made up by just how much fun the game is and its absolutely gorgeous to boot as it stands it already feels like a complete product but the promise of future updates down the line gives us even more to get excited about if arcade sport action isnt your bag itll likely do nothing to sway your opinion but if you have even a passing interest in this kind of caper mario strikers battle league is the best sports game on switch right now,1
for fans of pacman and his historical pedigree this is the best roundup yet spanning decades and featuring his most notable titles its the kind of collection the current wonder boy release should have been the arcade overworld is a nice touch although the frame rate is a big letdown and really should have been ironed out and while you might spend a while tinkering and designing your arcade space the attraction of the gimmick is ultimately shortlived presentation deficiencies aside though one cant really fault the comprehensiveness of the collection nor the quality of the titles themselves well except pac in time its a pacfestival and while it certainly has limited appeal it offers countless hours of gaming fun and an interesting historical insight into the yellow orbs evolution,1
kao the kangaroo may have been on hiatus for a while but were glad to see that hes back in good form wellpaced level design an appealing art style surprisingly satisfying combat and lots of collectibles to snag all come together to make for a thrillingly retro d platforming experience that said elements like an occasionally misbehaving camera and performance issues hold this adventure back from being the really excellent revival it could have been if you still find a lot to love about games like a hat in time demon turf or banjokazooie then were confident that youll have a great time with kao the kangaroo despite its minor issues if youre a bit tired of such games however this isnt going to do much to change your mind overall wed recommend investigating kao the kangaroo if youre the slightest bit interested despite some rough edges this is a charming platforming experience,1
nintendo switch sports is a charming but barebones offering its not a bad game by any stretch but it lacks an awful lot of what would make for a solid recommendation online play is the best option on offer with unlockable customisations and a predictably broader pool of players but its limited scope means youll be doing the same thing time after time local play is hobbled by a lack of any unlockables whatsoever and with such limited options to change up how each sport plays out solo play is a slog,1
despite us making numerous comparisons to the super nintendo game pocky rocky reshrined is for the vast majority a completely new entry in the series and thats worth celebrating for several reasons tengo project well aware of the originals pedigree was smart enough to only use it as inspiration rather than attempt to follow its lead beatforbeat within this modern framework the developer has constructed a thrilling tapestry of light colour and actionpacked junctures for hardcore gamers to get their teeth into is it better than natsumes venerable outing no but its about on par albeit for slightly different reasons pocky rocky reshrined is a blessing a gorgeouslooking delightfully artful new interpretation of a muchloved classic and a noteworthy example of what can be achieved creatively with the d medium if youre even mildly into the application of oldschool gaming disciplines it should be snapped up without a second thought,1
zombie army dead war is a surprisingly solid switch port of one of our favourite rebellion titles thus far theres a ton of zombie nazislaying sweetness to get stuck into here and although the graphics have taken a hit and the frame rate has been halved in comparison to other platforms whats here is eminently playable in both docked and handheld modes whether youre taking on hitlers undead hordes alone or with a few friends in tow this ones a ton of schlocky bmovie fun that gets a great big thumbs up from us,1
the ultimate question is whether you should play mlb the show on switch well it depends if its your main or only platform and youre happy playing cpu and offline games then yes its not bad and holds things together just enough for gameplay to be enjoyable if you want an onthego version to accompany a more powerful home console version perhaps on game pass then its another yes if you want to mainly play online in diamond dynasty no this isnt the way to go mlb the show is admirably packed with content and features but its not entirely comfortably packed into the diminutive switch it lacks the fluidity and crispness found elsewhere which is perhaps expected but doesnt change the fact if youre happy with the compromises though then step up to the plate,2
sentinels aegis rim is a wonderful achievement for dynamic storytelling as it puts forth a compelling and multifaceted narrative thatll keep you guessing right up until the very end this excellent story combined with enjoyable combat portions a striking art style and some topnotch voice acting make for an experience that you wont want to miss out on its the kind of game thatll have you wishing that you could play it again for the first time just so all its best elements could be new again wed give sentinels aegis rim a strong recommendation then to anyone who has even a passing interest in visual novels even if that doesnt describe you wed still say to give it a shot you might just be surprised at how well it grabs you,1
lego star wars the skywalker saga is a fantastic experience on switch a great big celebration of everything star wars thats made the jump to nintendos console in surprisingly fine form the upgrades to the series core gameplay here the combofocused combat flashy space battles boss encounters overtheshoulder shooting action and cover system all combine to make this the best lego star wars has ever felt to play throw in a humongous open world setting thats bursting at the seams with secrets and collectibles and youve got an absolute smorgasbord of all things star wars to dig into turns out we were fools to think we could ever get tired of jedis and lightsabers and the pewpewpew of flashy space guns,1
touken ranbu warriors is a game best suited for players with little experience with the dynasty warriors series in general if this is meant to appeal primarily to fans of the freetoplay games with far lower expectations when it comes to action games as a great big slice of touken danshi fan service this will be a great addition to their collection for players less versed in the world of touken ranbu this is a much harder sell offering a rote repetitive game loop that does little to slake your thirst for a more meaningful evolving game experience this criticism could arguably apply to all of the warriors games but where the bigger licensebased games add to the formula touken ranbu warriors feels like a distillation in a lot of ways and for certain audiences this is perfectly fine by this point in time the dynasty warriors machine is a welloiled refined and polite product the video game equivalent of a honda civic but even with a wellloved product as reliable as that there comes a point when its just time to get with the times,1
kirby and the forgotten land is a great big colourful joyride of an adventure for our little pink pal this first fully three dimensional mainline entry in the franchise is bursting at the seams with fun and inventiveness managing to transpose everything we know and love about past kirby games to this allnew arena whilst adding plenty of delightful new aspects as it goes mouthful mode is just as daftly entertaining as it looked in the trailers each and every level is packed full of secrets and dripping in wonderful detail and there are enough side activities collectibles and coop fun here to keep you entertained and coming back for more for a good long while what a grand way to celebrate years of planet popstars finest,2
is rune factory for you well that depends do you like rpgs or farm sims if you answered yes to either or both then youre sure to find something youll love in this release even so it might be worth waiting for a modest sale before you take the plunge the relaxing pace rpg elements and charming aesthetic make this a compelling experience but issues with poor performance disappointing visuals and sometimes clunky gameplay hold rune factory back from greatness if d visuals arent a dealbreaker for you wed recommend you pick up rune factory special first as its cheaper and oddly feels more modern in some respects despite flawed execution wed still give rune factory a recommendation if its precise and unique genre blend really clicks with you youll forgive many a flaw just know that it doesnt truly excel in any area,1
gal gun double peace knows its audience almost too well its entertainment factor is centred around crass perversion dressed up like a saturday morning kids cartoon and if anyone attempts to tell you its a play on satire addressing the difficulties japanese women face in a largely sexist society feel free to laugh loudly in their face that said this is admittedly more of a game and an altogether better game than most that fall into the ecchi category while simplistic theres nothing particularly broken about it and its expert mode does offer a playable enough game to be mildly involving but if you dont have a particular affection for its windowdressing theres not a great deal here to keep railshooting fans engaged,1
persona arena ultimax may not be the persona game everyones been clamoring for on the switch but were certainly not complaining pau offers up an approachable yet incredibly deep d fighting combat system a neat rpglite mode that guarantees solo players will have lots to do and all this is presented in arc system works signature and striking handdrawn art style while the story mode is a complete bore and theres no rollback netcode in this version we think pau on switch is still absolutely worth your time although if youre going to be playing online youll likely want to investigate the game on other platforms first for portable fans however wed give it a recommendation whether youre a fighting game enthusiast or youre just looking to give the genre a shot this is definitely one of the better fighting games on the switch,1
triangle strategy is an absolute triumph for artdink and square enix a fantastic mix of satisfyingly strategic battles an excellent choicedriven campaign narrative and topnotch worldbuilding all of which come together to form one of the finest tactical rpgs weve played in a very long time theres an absolute ton of content here with a huge story featuring multiple paths to take depending on the choices you make and several properly impactful endings to enjoy on return visits serenoa wollforts epic journey is a joy from start to finish a grand and ambitious adventure that stands proud as one of the very finest examples of its genre on switch,2
chocobo gp is a delightful surprise from square enix a slick and addictive effort that serves up chaotic kart racing action featuring a generous roster of final fantasy characters battling it out on welldesigned tracks inspired by locations from across the franchises history yes the story mode may be a bit of a misfire but with plenty of other single player content to dig into and the promise of player carnage via the online chocobo gp mode this is one of the most polished and entertaining kart racers currently available on switch and with a free lite version dropping at launch youve got nothing to lose by checking it out for yourself before committing to a purchase,1
atelier sophie stands as a wonderful achievement for gust and the atelier series what we have here is an entry that feels like the perfect fusion of the old and the new sophies new adventure may not have much to offer up in the story department but it more than makes up for this with its streamlined design thrilling combat expansive world and addictive alchemy system this is a title wed recommend to both longtime fans and newcomersits one of the best atelier releases yet if youre at all curious about this one wed strongly encourage you to give it a shot,1
assassins creed the ezio collection is a great compilation of some of the series most highlyregarded entries aside from some combat that lacks depth and a convoluted story each of the three games included here are absolutely worthy of your time theres still plenty of fun to be had if this is your first set of assassins creed games with the cities still managing to impress with their sense of scale and historical detail but some of the dated gameplay elements and glitches may make other entries a better jumping off point the rebel collection is a very fine alternative if you want slightly more modern interpretations of the series with a seafaring bent however if youre already a fan and are able to tolerate its foibles old and new assassins creed the ezio collection is an enjoyable trip into video game history and an easy recommendation,1
dynasty warriors empires is a poor switch port of a disappointing entry in the longrunning spinoff series this is a hugely downgraded version of the game with seriously dialledback visuals failing to put a stop to consistent frame rate issues during the heat of battle with a lack of gameplay modes zero multiplayer options terrible ai and cosmetic customisation options gone awol at launch koei tecmo choosing instead to go the dlc route this is a truly lacklustre package a bargain bin affair with a premium price tag and a dynasty warriors game you can feel quite comfortable skipping entirely,1
pokémon legends arceus feels like the result of game freak learning lessons for years refining the formula and finally taking the franchise in a new incredible exciting direction with its emphasis on extremely rewarding exploration addictive catching mechanics a fine roster of pokémon and a genuine sense of scale thats unlike anything in the series pokémon legends arceus is quite simply one of the greatest pokémon games ever made,2
record of lodoss war deedlit in wonder labyrinth doesnt take too long to beat even the most curiousthoroughcareful player is unlikely to go over the hour mark but when the adventures this much fun and as densely packed with creativity does it matter at the end of it all youre far more likely to feel satisfied than shortchanged and deedlits tale is a surprisingly touching one regardless of how much or little you already know about lodoss if youre after something with the flavour of symphony of the night that doesnt feel like a shallow knockoff this is a fine alternative,1
although theres nothing here that hasnt been seen previously this is still a package bursting at the seams with content and the sequels novelty christmas theme is perfect for memorable december gaming driven by an excellent set of punchy organ arrangements and murky musical notes deathsmiles i ii is a very large halloweenthemed cake an exuberant gothic flourish punctuated by enduring bosses and a unique routeandrank structure that encourages experimental replays with little middle ground between casual and concerted professional play it might not be caves most balanced piece of work but theres no doubt it has something for everyone no matter how you choose to approach it,1
disney magical world enchanted edition is a fine remaster of a ds game that many may have missed the first time around for players both young and old who love the classic disney characters spending time in castleton may well prove a joyous experience some aspects chiefly the poor character creation tool and rather basic combat could have done with a bit more tlc in this updated version but if youre after a decent life simulation game this is a nice disneyflavoured addition to an alreadythriving genre,1
big brain academy brain vs brain is a fun little romp which doesnt have ideas above its station and presents its brainteasers in a more lighthearted rowdier manner than dr kawashimas friendly but sterile style this isnt the kind of marriage between gameplay and for lack of a better term work that youll find in ring fit adventure but its a greatly enjoyable and budgetfriendly way to keep up the little pitterpatter of grey matter for all ages,1
danganronpa decadence is a very fine package that delivers a trio of deliciously devious and salacious murder mysteries plus a grindy sidegame we can live without the main games here are funny dramatic and pretty problematic so exercise some caution this is resolutely not a game for kids but even adults will struggle with some of its less savoury or more overtly brash thoughtless content if they sound at all appealing though we urge you to check the games out for yourself as theyre classics in the visual novel genre trigger happy havoc offers a memorable killing game with fantastic characters and a genuinely funny and smart script danganronpa goodbye despair is even sicker and more delightfully disturbing than the marvellous original it doesnt match its predecessor in some ways but makes up for its shortcomings in others our favourite is definitely the epic third game though go in blind and we promise youll be in for the ride of your life,2
thanks to the skill of the m team two very important shmups have enjoyed a range of thorough and brilliantly authentic ports as have two toaplan oddities but compared to many of the previous shottriggers releases toaplan arcade garage appears just a shade less ambitious still if you enjoy purebred s d shooters obsess over the shmup form or have a soft spot for arcade preservation it absolutely deserves to take up a little of your shelf space,1
nascar heat feels like a game right out of the mids the visuals alone are poor enough with blocky textures featureless environments and a frame rate that struggles to maintain a solid fps but when you have a completely unremarkable career mode forming the main bulk of the game theres really no recommending this to anyone but the most staunch of nascar fans nintendo gamers have been without a true nascar experience for several years now but if this is any indication of the quality were likely to expect we reckon it should probably retire in the pits,1
the wild at heart borrows several of its mechanics from nintendo ip theres no question about that this could have presented a bit of a problem had it not been for the exquisite visual style and presentation not to mention moonlight kids excellent execution of those mechanics with a story thats equal parts amusing intriguing and emotional alongside genuinely stunning d visuals youll be sucked into this world in no time minor frustrations with combat and loading times aside this is an adventure youll be glad you embarked on,1
while some of the slower elements of the original games have been fixed and the grand underground makes up for the comparatively weak pokédex pokémon brilliant diamond and shining pearls new art style and a few other stumbles make this pair of games a somewhat disappointing retread of generation theyre also very clearly in the shadow of pokemon legends arceus the upcoming openworldlike pokemon game that has fans hoping it can take the series in exciting new directions beyond yearold mechanics if the remit of these remakes was to remain faithful to the original gen pair we wish theyd also stuck to the pixelart aesthetic aside from the grand underground and the connectivity with the current games in the series theres very little reason to play pokémon brilliant diamond and shining pearl over your original ds copies,1
grand theft auto the trilogy the definitive edition on switch delivers three of gamings true greats in a shockingly rough package that manages to suck pretty much all of the fun out of rockstars stellar crime epics this is a poor port a shoddy stuttery low resolution mess full of bugs glitches audio problems and more besides if can grab this one on any other platform wed advise you do so or at the very least hold off until its been patched and hopefully improved in the future as things stand this is a very very long way from definitive this isnt the way we want to remember these games,1
if you enjoy party games but arent too keen on the board game mechanic seen in titles like mario party superstars then my singing monsters playground offers up a more streamlined experience that focuses purely on the minigames themselves which might prove perfect for families with younger gamers if youre looking for a meatier experience however the lack of any overarching campaign harms the games overall longevity frame rate struggles in some of the more chaotic minigames but for the most part developer big blue bubble has cooked up a nice addition to the party genre here,1
blue reflection second light improves on almost every aspect of the original with a mystery that feels more personal as the characters become closer the relationship between the girls as they seek to discover why they were brought to this strange world is the star of the show though the combat is fun it is always a vehicle to get you more story rather than the driving force of the game second light is a fantasticlooking anime adventure that youll love so long as you can accept that combat isnt the focus,1
just dance is okay its more of the same with some cool new tracks a slick and smooth experience overall that plays it safe and works just fine as a result however it also constantly pushes its subscription service and ends up feeling a little convoluted and tacky as it spends more time flogging tracks you dont own over letting you enjoy the ones included with the base game fans of the series or anyone whos just danced to even a single track from the series will know exactly what theyre getting here but newcomers should be aware that theyll need to fork out more cash after buying the game in order to enjoy the full experience,1
world war z is an unremarkable zombie shooter that serves up a decent fiveodd hours of action if you can find a few friends to play with its repetitive stuff basic and unsurprising for the most part but this switch port is solid managing to provide the fullfat experience without too much in the way of technical issues or other shortcomings if youre in the mood for blazing through bland masses of zombies with a few friends in tow this ones got you covered just dont expect much more than that,1
shin megami tensei v is a modern masterpiece it successfully delivers on all the aspects that have made the series thus far so popular with fansnamely through its high difficulty heavy narrative themes and expansive teambuilding optionswhile polishing up and tightening the weaker aspects things like a more easily navigable map and more difficulty options to cater to players of all skill levels comfortably make this the most approachable entry in the series and it feels like theres more things to do in the world than ever before if you are at all a fan of rpgs or have been looking for a good entry point into this oft overlooked series we would strongly encourage you to pick this up as soon as you can shin megami tensei v was worth the wait atlus has successfully stuck the landing with this one,2
demon turf is a fantastic platformer thats held back from true greatness by sections of dull and repetitive combat push through this however and youve got a game that rewards daring and bravery bolstered by wonderful platforming controls that let you string together incredible combos the visuals are initially a bit jarring but the character design really shines through and give it a timeless aesthetic if youre a fan of d platformers from the golden n era and beyond this one is well worth a look,1
with splitscreen coop and incredibly gentle expectations as far as the gameplay is concerned lego marvel super heroes is a fantastic lowstakes game for parents and kids to play together but also for adults who are looking for something that pleasantly whiles away the hours without beating you over the head with difficulty excelsior,1
mario party superstars is a love letter to the parties you remember attending years ago a disappointingly slim selection of boards takes the shine off things somewhat but its hard to argue that this is the best mario party has been in over a decade no new ideas absolutely feels like a missed opportunity but by the same token wed much prefer to have all these classic ideas intact rather than potentially tainting them with unwanted and unnecessary inclusions only added for the sake of being new grab a can of tango and a fistful of p freddos youre going to party like its,2
dying light on switch is quite a remarkable achievement and were happy to report that techland has mostly stuck the landing with this one its ambitious open world full of zombies is unlike anything else in the switchs library and between the core campaign and six years of constant dlc updates theres potentially hundreds of hours of enjoyment to be had here granted all of this comes at the cost of performance that can be middling compared to other platforms but this is neatly balanced out by the convenience of playing in handheld mode wed give dying light a strong recommendation though with the caveat that switch owners who rarely play in portable mode may want to pause and consider buying it elsewhere wherever you may fall wed strongly encourage you to consider this switch port it really is quite good,2
cotton cotton boomerang and guardian force are a lot of fun and let down not by their age but the quality of these switch ports what shouldve been a complete nobrainer purchase for anyone looking for more arcade action is now something to carefully consider first and possibly wait for a sale or a patch there are many other shmups retro arcade and brand new on switch that are all more deserving of your hardearned money,1
astria ascending may not be a flawless release but the solid combat system spectacular visuals deep character skill building and wealth of content make for an experience that jrpg fans will feel right at home with wed give this one a recommendation to anybody looking for an original rpg to sink their teeth into the writing and plot could have done with more development and attention but theres lots to love about astria ascending and were eagerly anticipating whatever artisan studios does next,1
nickelodeon allstar brawl is a solid platform fighter with an awful lot of hidden depth and also an unfortunate lack of polish outside the fighting if hardcore gameplay is the number one concern youll have a wealth to sink your teeth into here but expect to be underwhelmed by various elements that surround it theres a grand old time to be had but its no super smash bros damn it yet again,1
first cases is a significant change of direction from the abc murders poirots last outing also published by microids stepping comfortably into visual novel territory and casting aside the puzzling that would hold back narrative flow your fantasy is one not of being hercule poirot but rather of enjoying a poirot novel the switch lets you indulge in that as you would a great book whether in the wingback of your stately homes library or indeed on the toilet of your bedsit for storytelling the game format is ideal even ingenious the trademark christie web of connections between events evidence and the psychology of the characters is planned out in front of your eyes either to pore over on a diagram or to stroll through in the neatly presented settings the games main limitations are the inanimate world and workaday writing that fail to lend the sparkle of life to a wellmachined story nonetheless while puzzleloving gamers shouldnt pick this one up visual novel fans and herculeheads wont be able to put it down,1
metroid dread is a triumphant return for both samus aran and developer mercurysteam this is a superslick hugely entertaining and exquisitely designed entry in the metroid franchise that plays better than anything weve seen from the series so far with a bunch of fantastic new abilities super tense and enjoyable stealth sections plenty of great big boss fights and a story that fans will definitely enjoy we cant really see how this one could have been any better best metroid game ever this could be the one,2
monster crown is a decent game that falls short of greatness in a few areas legitimately cool ideas with breeding and an overall solid combat system are let down by lackluster monster designs and performance issues then theres the elephant in the room which is that monster crown ultimately feels like a jankier and less addictive version of the oldest pokémon games wed still give this one a recommendation as the bones of the experience are good enough that its worth a punt for big pokémon fans pining for the bit days but you might want to wait for a sale with this one,1
embr has the potential to be a good time a slapstick bit of carnage with friends that provides a decent amount of missions to blast through and plenty of unlockables and variations on modes to keep you and your party of first responders busy however on switch this potential goes almost entirely unrealised as the online component of the game is a bust get a few switchowning friends to set up a match and you may find some fun here but without crossplay and factoring in a few other gameplay irritations this one is quite hard to recommend on nintendos console,1
dragon ball z kakarot might not do much more than retelling the story of dragon ball but it does that well enough that existing fans will find joy in exploring the world and fighting iconic villains from the franchise despite the lack of depth to its combat and a minor internetbased technical inconvenience to work around the game saves itself by expanding on the already massive amount of dragon ball lore available and giving fans the sliceoflife moments weve so sorely needed nonfans wont find much to love here but its a more than serviceable retelling of an iconic story,1
darksiders iii on switch is a poor port of a distinctly average entry in the series constant technical issues make fighting and platforming more frustrating than fun long loading times follow every death and the further along you get the worse these issues seem to become its a shame as were pretty big fans of the series in general but if you have any other means of playing this one wed advise you give this clunky version a miss,1
it may not be saying much but super monkey ball banana mania is the best the series has been in almost two decades and newcomers are bound to find a lot to love it wears its heart on its sleeve and clearly the team has true passion for the franchise its packed full of content new ways to play and there are so many extras and improvements that never existed in the original unfortunately the engine beneath it all isnt quite up to the job what theyve achieved with unity simply isnt on par with the originals and while the main game is still enjoyable many of the party games are severely hindered until monkey target returns to its former glory we cannot truly say super monkey ball is back,1
knockout home fitness doesnt do anything inherently wrong with the selection of short fitness routines it offers but it fails to support its bareminimum motion tracking with any extra notable features or gamification to differentiate it from fitness dvds or youtube videos ring fit adventure has blown the fitness genre open on switch and with various other alternatives available knockout home fitness feels a little too limited oldfashioned and outclassed by the competition,1
as it stands right now hot wheels unleashed is a fun racer whose fantastic selection of cars makes up for its relative lack of varied course environments with updates and dlc it has the potential to become a brilliant mess of licensed properties in the way the best mashup games are but whats here is a solid enough foundation to start from even if its a little samey at launch,1
all in all colors live is a useful art application with some strange limitations the sonar pen and layers are absolutely welcome in our eyes but the lack of a bucket tool restricted brush styles and many other staples left us a bit wanting having said that people have already been creating tremendous artwork showing that any medium is only as powerful as the artists skillset wed have liked to see a more complete digital art package but for someone who already owns a switch and wants to try doodling on a screen with something more than their finger colors live provides a simple and easy entry point,1
rims racing is a super complex motorcycle sim that provides players with a ton of depth in terms of tinkering tuning and customising however once on the track this switch port is let down badly by performance issues that make it a frustrating messy experience theres definitely a market for this type of indepth motorbike action on nintendos console but in this state its very hard to recommend diving into this particular offering,1
a fantastic tribute to fantasy life that nails the kind of grindy combat that many people love kitaria fables is genuinely sweet and impressively wellmade for a threeperson team in under three years if fantasy life is a wagyu beef steak kitaria fables is a really really good burger if youre jonesing for a tasty actionfarmingadventure kitaria fables has you covered,1
theres nothing inherently wrong with active life outdoor challenge its a charming enough game with controls that are responsive enough for the most part its main failing is a general lack of content and the fact that the joycon and leg strap combination isnt quite as fun as the original mat the wii version came with ring fit adventure wont be sweating over the competition then but family trainer is still a pleasant enough diversion for fans of light cv,1
ni no kuni revenant kingdom is an excellent actionrpg thats arrived on switch in a fantastic featurepacked port evan and rolands antics across this games sprawling world are stuffed full of great characters exciting combat and adventuring and a kingdom building mechanic thats a delight to get to grips with it looks and sounds every bit as good as its predecessor and although the story might be a little more hitandmiss here we were completely hooked into this one from beginning to end this is a sumptuously crafted adventure you wont regret diving into,1
nba k is another fine entry in the franchise that continues the developers habit of delivering satisfyingly solid ports of their basketball sims on nintendo switch yes most of the modes dont try anything massively new beyond mycareers revamped neighbourhood setting and the loading screens will have you pulling your hair out from time to time but refined core gameplay and enough content to keep you playing until the end times make this one an easy recommendation for bball fans,1
as long as youre willing to put up with some performance hits and the fact that theres no online multiplayer cruisn blast is a hugely entertaining arcade style racer with incredible setpieces that has us crossing every possible body part in the hope that its successful enough to encourage more of the same somewhere down the line,2
big rumble boxing creed champions is a solid take on the rockycreed franchise celebrating the wide variety of fighters that contributed to the series over the years the gameplay is rather basic for the most part with little deviation in style between the characters but fundamentally the fights all feel fun and its incredibly satisfying when you land a knockout blow on your opponent the graphics benefit well from more stylised art design but limitations with the arenas crowds do stand out if youre a fan of rocky though then youll definitely want to step into the ring and try this one out,1
warioware get it together is a triumphant switch debut for the subversive series that makes some daring changes to core gameplay resulting in the best entry in the franchise to date with a generous roster of playable characters lots of solo and multiplayer modes to dig into and stages that cleverly adapt to your choices on the fly this is a superb compilation of hilarious microgames that delivers more ways to play than ever before youll laugh youll cry youll dodge bird droppings on a skateboard so grab a few friends or family members break out the controllers and gather round the tv warioware get it together is essential stuff,1
monster harvest is a good example of why great ideas also need to be followed up with great execution theres nothing wrong with the idea of a farm sim with monstercatching elements but monster harvest does a rough job of convincing you of that the monster rpg content is so poorly done that it might as well have not been implemented at all as it clearly took focus away from the decent farm sim portion of the gameplay amazingly the farm sim gameplay still redeems this enough that its not a complete dumpster fire but wed only give this the barest of recommendations to anybody looking for another entry in the genre take our word for it youre much better off just starting over with a new farm in stardew valley or picking up rune factory,1
sonic colors ultimate is a wellexecuted revisit of a high point in sonics long career most of the quality here stems from the content of the original rather than the new additions and tweaks for this rerelease things like the jade ghost and extra customization options are welcome but not game changing and the musical and graphical improvements are minimal at the end of the day though this is still a wellperforming portable version of a classic and thats arguably all that it needs to be wed give this one a recommendation then to anyone who has yet to experience sonic colors as this is certainly the best and easiest way to try it out if youre a fan of the original wed still say its worth a punt youll still love the game on switch just be aware that this isnt a massive overhaul of what came before,1
rustler attempts to take us back to classic topdown gta action in a neat medieval setting but poor performance shoddy controls weak humour and a dull short campaign hold it back from reaching its potential there are glimmers of good stuff here a few fun pop culture references those beatboxing bards and a goodlooking world to stomp around in but the game underneath is just so underwhelming and uninspired and in the end it all feels like a big step back from its most obvious inspirations,1
were always fans of seeing lesserknown games in any genre get a bit of love and exposure to new players and the two games in the nis classics volume collection both have a lot to offer tactics fans phantom braves combat system is unique among tactical rpgs and soul nomads take on the heros journey is still interesting years after its ps release however both games feel even older than they are the unattractive visuals and uneven voice acting of this compilation rerelease arent going to change anyones mind who wasnt a fan before nor prove attractive for a new audience,2
no more heroes iii has the faults of both its mainline predecessors its a little more tedious than no more heroes and a little less meaningful than no more heroes it makes up for this however by being another inarguably impressive ballstothewall carnagefest a bloodspattered love letter to excess and a suda fans wet dream splashed across the switch the story it tells is cool the game it plays is cool neither of these crucial aspects reach the heights of the series nintendo wii origins but nobody who truly gets no more heroes could reasonably be disappointed with this third incarnation the jokes beginning to wear thin but its all in the telling and suda can still spin a very fine yarn,1
slime rancher plortable edition is a title that doesnt do the game justice this isnt a strippedback nokia ngage version of a grand game this is the real deal and its blinkin marvellous farming slimes exploring the world getting frustrated at the price of crystal plorts never going up its a dense and wondrous experience having to travel so much on foot stops it from achieving extreme greatness but its not enough to stop us giving this a hearty recommendation,1
its hard to quantify whether the silver case is a good game certainly we didnt enjoy it in the slightest but its extremely purposeful with its sudaness his work might be an acquired taste but for those whove already acquired it this may well fill in the gaps in his back catalogue that youve been waiting for in the case of anyone new to sudas work this visual novel is just too hard to recommend,1
greak memories of azur is a solid platformer by navegante entertainment delivering a well realised world with interesting characters gorgeous handcrafted visuals and intriguing environments that beg to be explored the combat can be a bit hit and miss at times and the distinct lack of coop play despite the ability to switch characters at will feels like a missed opportunity as a storydriven adventure title though this one is absolutely worth a punt,1
shadowverse champions battle is without a doubt the greatest card battling rpg on the switch yet an addictive and incredibly deep card game wrapped up in a heartwarming and enjoyable rpg that supplements and supports the potent core gameplay in all the right ways dozens of hours of content in single player alone combined with a fullfledged online multiplayer ensures that youre getting plenty of bang for your buck while the anime presentation and detailed card art and animations keep everything looking and sounding nice all the way through if youre at all into card games dont waste your time deliberating go buy this game immediately shadowverse champions battle is an extremely easy game to recommend and absolutely worth your time,1
samurai warriors takes the longrunning franchise gives it a wonderfully vibrant lick of paint throws in some excellent new combat mechanics and fills its story mode with welldirected cutscenes resulting in a slick and stylish addition to the series thats sure to please fans and newcomers alike yes it makes a few fumbles here and there we arent fond of its grindy system of upgrading your dojo and blacksmith it limits your character choices at times in the campaign and that stripped back roster is sure to irk some but overall whats here is a fine addition to the switchs lineup of musou titles this is a fastpaced flashy hack and slash effort that looks and plays fantastically well and most importantly performs almost perfectly whilst doing so,1
neo the world ends with you impresses in all the categories we were terrified it could fail in the game boasts an energetic soundtrack that feeds off the energy of the original a deep and rewarding combat system that makes a successful leap to d an inspiring cast of characters that stand tall on their own and importantly a world that begs you to come back even after youve finished the hour campaign after long years many fans lost hope wed ever see a sequel to that first reapers game but were so pleased to see these talented developers never lost their calling,2
the great ace attorney chronicles is two brilliant games for the price of one and it not only gives us more of what we love but gives us something that is visually narratively and historically deeper than ever before theres a bit of a learning curve that youll have to get on top of to meet the game where its at but honestly we couldnt have asked for a better version of the game weve been wanting for years,2
cris tales offers up a satisfying take on classic jrpg tropes while sprinkling in some interesting new gameplay ideas and an incredible art style though some aspects of combat can be frustrating and the pacing can occasionally feel like its wasting your time wed still give this one a recommendation to anyone looking for a cool new rpg for their switch cris tales does just enough to stick out from the pack and assert itself as a title worth adding to your library jrpg aficionados should definitely give this one a shot,1
bewitching in both incarnations cottons reboot is a fanfare of zany ghouls and ghosts inventive and inimitable bosses and a superbly catchy soundtrack in both original and remixed forms never being released in the west and prohibitively expensive today its something of a blessing for retro gamers to be able to dip their toes in cottons enduringly impressive x outing of all the cute em ups out there it remains one of the best while the new arrange mode with its impressive overhauls and remixed ideas has cast a rare spell of resurrection,1
the legend of zelda skyward sword hd introduces a raft of technical improvements and quality of life updates that reinvigorate and revitalise this tenyearold game with motion controls more precise than ever before an alternate button control scheme that totally works crisp hd graphics smooth fps gameplay and a bothersome sidekick whos been streamlined into something altogether more useful this really does feel like skyward sword as it was meant to be experienced yes the locking off of instant travel behind the official amiibo is a misstep but beyond this one issue whats here is a sublime experience a technical triumph and an absolute mustplay for switch owners and zelda fans,2
ys ix monstrum nox isnt a massive step up over its tropical predecessor but it hits all the right beats it needs to make for an addictive and engaging actionrpg fastpaced combat a memorable setting and a surprisingly contentrich open world make for an experience that actionrpg fans wont want to miss out on were it not for the performance issues we might even be inclined to say this is the best example of the genre on the switch yet given those problems however a totally unreserved recommendation of ys ix monstrum nox on switch is tough to make performance is reported to be a little bit better on ps and ps so if you have access to one of those consoles wed recommend getting it there otherwise youre still in for a good time on switch just brace yourself for those frame drops,1
monster hunter stories wings of ruin deserves to find a sizable audience its full of charm and boasts depth that can immerse the committed or be dabbled with by those eager to simply experience the story as a blend of monster hunter with a traditional rpg approach its an accomplished effort and offers the sort of meaty experience thatll keep most players busy for weeks switch owners will need to tolerate some disappointing performance unfortunately but the overall experience shines nonetheless its a game of bright colours and wholehearted optimism which is very welcome indeed,2
dont discount doki doki literature club because its cute because its pink or because its an anime dating game this is one of the most unnerving effective horror games on the nintendo switch to date the extra content adds nicely to the creeping anxiety and the heartbreaking story but the switch version does end up feeling slightly inferior to the pc version despite fantastic effort on the port you wont lose anything by playing this version though if its the one you want go for it,2
destroy all humans returns in a remake that refreshes the originals visuals modernises its controls and adds a few new weapon and traversal upgrades to proceedings all whilst failing to make any meaningful changes to the games rather outdated core gameplay whats here is still silly fun for sure decimating dullard humans with cryptos high tech alien gadgets and unstoppable flying saucer can still provide some chaotic catharsis but theres no denying this ones showing its age mechanically and newcomers to the series may well be left feeling a little underwhelmed,1
if you werent allured by the distinctive style and crazy indepth gameplay of previous entries in the franchise disgaea defiance of destiny certainly isnt the game to change your mind like its predecessors disgaea is still a goofy and staggeringly intricate srpg that will take hundreds of hours to see through to completion however this is easily the most streamlined and enjoyable entry in the series yet as the developers have doubled down on everything that makes these games great and made some improvements too it can be intimidating to get into as a newcomer and the performance is frequently disappointing but we would still absolutely recommend that you add disgaea to your library,1
mario golf super rush is a game that in many respects hits its marks golf adventure has plenty of charm and offers a fun way to learn various mechanics and unlock courses away from that solo endeavour there are decent options and customisation for multiplayer games local or online button controls or motionbased swinging its not a premium effort however with a nagging feeling of corners cut and at times an absence of creativity however many players should get a good amount of fun out of this one both solo and with friends this aint the masters but for mario golf fans it is a solid par,1
tony hawks pro skater on nintendo switch is a rock solid port of a pair of genuinely fantastic remakes these really are two of the very best arcade sports titles of all time revamped reworked and reimagined for modern audiences with all the graphical bells and whistles collectibles and game modes weve come to expect in this day and age with flawless performance in both docked and handheld modes and visuals that still look the part after a few necessary concessions here and there this is one collection we highly recommend you kickflip right into as soon as possible,2
we cant pretend this isnt a disappointment after promises of updates and improvements to this classic title what weve got is something that wed honestly not recommend to either prospective new fans or enthusiasts of the original alex kidd were inclined to think this may have been something of a rushed release but thats pure speculation based on some of the more lax features theres a lot of new dialogue but almost all of it is awkwardly written with typos and errors alex kidd in miracle world dx is not horrible by any means and you might have fun with it until you run up against its irritating issues unless you use infinite lives in which case youll finish the game in two hours tops if this was supposed to be alex kidds big comeback were sad to say that we dont think well be seeing that alex kidd hightech world remake any time soon,1
game builder garage is a frighteningly powerful game creation tool dragged down by a few limiting factors the lack of an object creation tool and pyramids means that most games are going to look like they were made in a game creation suite but the sheer scope of whats possible helps to take the sting out of the tail this will actually teach you how to make games the tutorials that lead you through are byandlarge excellent and the inclusion of usb mouse support is a godsend were probably unable to even conceive of half of what switch owners will be able to create using this software but were certain this is going to help propagate the next generation of game developers,1
dc super hero girls teen power could have easily been a disaster a cheap cashin with little or no merit thankfully its actually a surprisingly comprehensive and satisfying experience that fans of the show will absolutely love there are plenty of characters to interact with an excellent shopping feature and lots of fun little tasks to keep you occupied dont get us wrong the game knows its target audience and caters to that younger demographic so older gamers may not gel with the overall tone and simplistic gameplay however kids who might not yet be ready for the grimdark martha dceu this might be the perfect alternative,1
worlds end club has some good ideas and a lot of heart but it ultimately doesnt come together as anything particularly notable though worlds end club looks and sounds great the monotonous platforming sections and hitandmiss storytelling really drag the overall experience down wed give this game a light recommendation to fans of visual novels but otherwise youre better served playing the various better visual novels and puzzle platformers already on switch this is the very definition of okay,1
maneater is a great idea for a video game a ridiculous shark revenge fantasy in an open world setting with plenty of humour injected through its unique narrative framing and the vocal talents of chris parnell however as much as terrorising beach goers and snatching hunters from the bows of their fishing boats is a pretty good time and as much as we enjoyed watching our orphaned bull shark grow from helpless pup to apex predator the whole thing is let down by poor combat and the very worst kind of busywork side quests with a little more variety in missions and a few refinements made to combat this could have been a killer actionrpg as things stand however its all a little toothless,1
overall there are parts of asha in monster world that are a little rusty and the end product couldve used more than just the tweaking we ended up getting while fans of the mega drive game may enjoy revisiting it they may also be disappointed that theres not a whole lot thats new still the elements that made it such a classic in the first place the endearing protagonist the delightful game world are still present and all of that still holds up brilliantly even after nearly thirty years,1
miitopia is a weird old game thats for sure if from what youve read you think youd enjoy seeing king king dedede sic encouraging our very own zion grassl to marry his daughter kazooie over jon cartwright then youre bound to have a good time with this its very much the type of game in which you get out as much as you put in if youre not into injecting a copy of chibirobo zip lash into the role of a genie then you might want to think twice or at least give the free demo a whirl whimsy and madcap situations aplenty this is a crossover that could rival super smash bros ultimate provided youre willing to put the effort in,1
snowrunner is an interesting truck driving game where the environment is your opponent as long as you can put up with its audio and visual issues and understand that its an extremely slowpaced game the rewards for sticking with it are worthwhile,1
shin megami tensei iii hd remaster is indisputably the best way to play this rpg classic but its also rather clear that this nearly twodecadeold game is showing its age an interesting story enjoyable combat system and engaging demon recruitment and fusion mechanics make shin megami tensei iii well worth your time but the dated visuals poor quality music and occasionally unforgiving mechanics are hold it back from being excellent wed give this a recommendation to both longtime fans and newcomers but with the caveat that you might want to wait for a sale before snapping this up,1
subnautica and its excellent sequel have arrived on switch in unexpectedly fine form this is an absolutely essential survival smorgasbord a fantastic port and something of a mustbuy double feature for fans of the genre if youre purchasing one or the other separately on switch wed still plump for the original game as below zeros fleshed out narrative and onfoot sections dilute the overall experience ever so slightly but regardless of which you choose youre in for a mighty good time here with two of the very best survival games currently available on any platform,1
yes raiden iv is not a typical shmup by contemporary standards and wont be for everyone equally all of these modes have been available in some form elsewhere but as a single package raiden iv x mikado remix offers the switch one of its best shooting game releases yet and that is saying something on a console that has emerged as an unexpected star vehicle for the genre,1
rtype final makes an authentic if flawed contribution to an iconic shooting game series many of the problems seem technical so hopefully an update could do plenty especially if it lets you lock that camera pitch all we can hope for then is that we are still in the beginning of rtypes final phase and that what final gets right is allowed to rise to the top,1
if like us youve been waiting a significant chunk of your life for a sequel to pokémon snap then youre in luck new pokémon snap brings back almost everything that made the original special and fleshes it out into a much more elaborate game this is something you can sink some serious time into and while there are some minor frustrations and pacing issues in the story playing freely at your own pace is a pure joy the original has gone down in history possibly as pokémons greatest spinoff and it may have just been dethroned,2
trails of cold steel iv is the climax that fans of the series deserve comprehensively delivering on its promise as the end of a saga while setting up future plotlines that are sure to affect the lore in all kinds of fascinating ways that said this is also a rather weird game to recommend newcomers absolutely should not play this game first given that its a concluding chapter to an ongoing saga years in the making longtime fans on the other hand dont need any convincing as theyre going to get this game if theyve already invested the hundreds of hours of legwork that set it up assuming thats you trails of cold steel iv is a spectacular rpg experience that no fan of the genre will want to miss out on and we can comfortably say that its worth your time,1
poison controls story is clichéfilled but fun and the tongueincheek dialogue carries the game far further than its gameplay could manage alone the writing can only make up for shallow game mechanics to a point though and ultimately shallow gameplay is what lets this game down visual novel fans will likely find more to enjoy here but theres simply not enough gameplay depth or variety for fans of shooters,1
bladed fury is a goodlooking hack n slash platformer that tells a decent tale and is set in an engrossing period of history thats been nicely infused here with mythological and supernatural elements its soul sliver mechanic adds plenty of scope for strategic combat shenanigans and its levels have a few good ideas thrown into the mix however all of these positive aspects are let down by poor implementation dull enemies who dont force you to utilise your moveset bland and repetitive area layouts simplistic platforming and constant technical issues that plague combat just as its starting to up the ante if the framerate issues are addressed this one may be worth a look for fans of the genre otherwise its hard to recommend in its current state,1
root film builds off of what its predecessor did well while managing to feel very distinct and more grownup than root letter the switch versions portability makes it much easier to get those hours in than the ps version but those who werent fans of root letter or who are on the fence might want to wait until a sale or pick up the digital version of the game for fans of murder mysteries there are plenty of cases to get stuck into and rich locations to explore we think it is worth the full price but cant blame people for being put off by the hefty price tag,1
while not by any means the best story of seasons game on the market pioneers of olive town is promising and disappointing in equal measure perhaps future patches will iron out some of the issues with framerate and boring character dialogue but for now potential buyers should be aware that this game isnt quite in a state we can recommend,1
all in all overcooked all you can eat is an absolute mustbuy for anybody looking for a fantastic party game to play with friends the wacky visuals and chaotic gameplay make it an ideal game for local coop and theres plenty of content to work through across the entire series so far team and ghost town games have explored a lot of cool ideas via dlc content and ensured that each expansion had unique theming and gameplay mechanics considering that all of this is offered in addition to the stellar base campaign in both games overcooked all you can eat really stands as a nobrainer overcooked alone is one of the very best local coop games you can currently buy for the switch and if youve been looking for that next game to play when you have friends over look no further than this the only downside is that those who have already dipped into either title or both wont find a massive amount of new stuff here outside of the exclusive peckish rises expansion,1
plants vs zombies battle for neighborville complete edition more than lives up to its name a huge amount of content lots of replayability and an overall charming aesthetic make this an easy recommendation for anybody looking for a solid new shooter for their switch that said just bear in mind that it often runs into performance issues and that the singleplayer offering can prove to be a little repetitive in the long run if you can get past those issues this release will surely prove to be worth both your time and money,1
new mechanics monsters and a gorgeous setting make monster hunter rise a new highwater mark for the franchise the wirebug switch skills palamute and carefully thoughtout monsters shake things up enough to make the game feel fresh for hunters who have previously spent thousands of hours with the series and while the package could be slightly intimidating for newcomers its arguably the ideal place to get started if youre serious about getting into the franchise and with a peerless fourplayer multiplayer experience the new rampage quests are a blast after spending some serious time with the game its very easy to say that monster hunter rise is one of the strongest entries into the franchise to date and another stonecold classic for the nintendo switch,2
despite a somewhat lacking narrative and a fairly short length we saw the beautiful credits in less than four hours sea of solitude is fun to play while it lasts it looks superb and theres plenty of variety in the locales even in its brief running time sadly though its not a standout it wasnt on its original release and it still isnt here on the switch its no walking simulator but in trying to marry its story with somewhat rudimentary platforming gameplay neither are entirely satisfactory of course your mileage may vary in what the various heavier themes mean to you but we found them pretty leaden and uninteresting takes on what are admittedly quite universal issues,1
the improved frame rate makes wrc a better experience than wrc but it still suffers from a number of issues through no fault of the developer such as a lack of analogue triggers and a reduced rally count however the extremely distracting nature of the scenery which is constantly drawing itself in right in front of you makes it difficult to get properly immersed in the action its probably the best rally game on the switch so far but for fans of the sport the wait continues for something truly brilliant on the system,1
an absolute pleasure from start to finish what kaze and the wild masks lacks in originality it makes up for in the strength of its level design responsive controls kinetic move set and attractive visuals excellent actionpacked platforming through and through with great gameplay variety and gimmicks that dont compromise on what the game is best at challenging fastpaced obstacle courses and deviouslyhidden secret areas easiest sell kaze and the wild masks is to donkey kong country what freedom planet was to sonic the hedgehog dont miss this one,1
kingdoms of amalur rereckoning is a rather barebones revamp of a cult classic action rpg thats really beginning to show its age in many respects the core combat here is still strong stuff crunchy hack and slash action with plenty of flexibility and variety in how you go about decking out your character but its also surrounded by a world and story that are very much of their time fans of the original game will no doubt enjoy what is a mostly fine switch port but there so many other more modern rpg experiences available at this point on nintendos console that everyone else should perhaps approach with a measure of caution,1
if youre looking for the next stardew valley this doesnt even come close harvest moon one world is a poor imitation of what the series once was and it feels more like a rushed mobile game than a fullfledged switch game these games have always been about chores but this one feels like a chore to play in our opinion your money is better spent on something that respects you as a fan of the genre,1
the switch version of crash is a perfectly passable port of a fantastic platformer thats absolutely rammed with things to do it may have the lowest frame rate and resolution of all versions of the game but if the switch is your main console or youre looking to enjoy some bandicootbouncing on the go in handheld mode its still an excellent offering when judged on its own merits,1
hellpoint is a reasonably decent scifisoulslike effort that sticks closely to fromsoftwares wellworn formula whilst introducing a few neat new tricks and twists of its own the combat here is solid the space station setting often spectacular and the narrative as enticingly cryptic as youd expect from the genre however the whole thing suffers massively due to myriad technical issues on switch constant crashes to the consoles homescreen a seriously flaky framerate long loading times and a pretty huge graphical downgrade result in an experience thats infuriating for all the wrong reasons and one that its almost impossible to recommend in its current form heres hoping cradle games has some big patches incoming,1
azur lane crosswave is a game that was best left on smartphones the visual novel sequences are perfectly fine and the story itself while utterly bonkers is interesting enough to keep you engaged while the characters are both charming and unique sadly the naval combat sequences bring down the entire experience theyre slow repetitive rarely require much strategic thought and look incredibly bland all at once this is a game for hardcore fans of the genre only everyone else ought to look elsewhere for their naval combat needs,1
as if it was ever in doubt square enix has demonstrated once again that it understands exactly what ingredients are necessary to make a great rpg the interesting riskbased combat is supported by a diverse class system and a welltold story which all combine to make for an experience that can be tough to put down that said one cant help but feel a consistent sense of been there done that with bravely default ii square certainly couldve pushed the envelope just a little more with this entry that aside you really cant go wrong with bravely default ii this is a wellcrafted and expertlymade rpg that is easily worth your time and money wed highly recommend that fans and newcomers alike look into picking this up,2
taxi chaos feels very much like a proof of concept its certainly evidence that a taxi game has its place in though its lacking that vital spark that would truly make it a mustplay title the city itself is wellmade with plenty of sights to behold but the overall visual design feels a bit generic and lacks its own voice there are few incentives to play for extended periods of time so how long the game lasts is largely dependent on your own willingness to climb the online leaderboard nevertheless taxi chaos is an admirable revival of a genre thats been dormant for far too long and a good foundation for a potential sequel down the line,1
galguns returns is a soso remaster of a tedious onrails shooter that features dull unchallenging and highly repetitive action set against a cringeworthy story thats neither titillating or in any other way engaging this is a very short and basic game for the asking price and one that its hard to see anyone outside of hardened no pun intended galgun fans deriving even the slightest amount of enjoyment from,1
super mario d world remains one of the better linear mario games and anyone playing it for the first time is in for an absolute treat add to that the curious bonus adventure that is bowsers fury and youve got a package that provides great value for money it isnt without its flaws but most of these online multiplayer repetitive missions in bowsers fury relate to the new additions the main game itself remains as pure and perfect as it was seven years ago had it just been super mario d world on its own wed be thoroughly recommending it anyway bowsers fury is just the cherry on top,2
little nightmares ii is nothing less than engaging from start to finish with superb pacing entertainingly varied level design and excellent graphics and performance its only real flaws are based on the imprecision that comes with all games in its subgenre as well as a few sections that feel more about trial and error than reactive survival in our view though this doesnt detract from a far superior sequel and one of the best cinematic platformers weve had the privilege of enjoying a real stylish treat,2
persona strikers is a slick and stylish spinoff that manages to successfully combine a surprisingly strong story with some satisfying musouinspired hackandslash action there are a few issues here and there with some necessary grinding at points slight difficulty imbalances and a camera that can be a bit of a pain during busy battles but overall this is a thoroughly entertaining action rpg that comes highly recommended,2
its rare to see amiga games surfacing at all so its a real treat to have two of the very best available on switch along with entirely enjoyable mega drive and snes efforts we know weve harped on this but it really is a baffling shame that super turrican was left off the set given that its still a joyous and impressive experience and that its inclusion would have made this compilation basically complete as it is though turrican flashback is still a lot of fun with plenty of gameplay to offer and a nice window into a type of game you rarely see anymore except in gunlord x we suppose,1
atelier ryza lost legends and the secret fairy takes everything good about gusts atelier adventure and further refines it resulting in the best entry in the longrunning franchise to date this may still be a relatively smallscale oldfashioned jrpg experience but its one thats full of heart great characters slick combat and some excellent new ruinbased dungeons anyone looking for a relaxed and enchanting jrpg to sink their time into should definitely check this one out,2
space invaders extreme is awesome but even in the guise of a cutdown compilation space invaders forever is lacking as a package better titles could have been chosen and the way the apps are laid out is strange and disconnected when it drops in price this will be essential for extreme alone if you want arkanoid vs space invaders thats available on your phone for a fair price and better suited to that format in general a disappointing and confusing package but one that we strongly recommend at a discount just to get space invaders extreme its that good all six of these points are for it and it alone,1
taiko no tatsujin rhythmic adventure pack is an incredibly comprehensive experience that both fans of the series and newcomers will love the story modes boast fun characters and engaging battles though the random encounter feature from rhythmic adventure can get a little tiring after a while the real meat of the experience once again lies with taiko mode which features a generous selection of song across various genres and the accessible nature of the gameplay makes it immediately gratifying and addictive its a shame the motion control scheme remains unreliable and you really should invest in a taiko drum for the full experience but thankfully the touch screen and face button controls are more than capable,1
puyo puyo could never have hoped to have the same impact as the first game did but it remains a brilliant puzzle title nevertheless while some may feel its not quite different enough from its predecessor the new singleplayer story is just as entertaining as the last one and the skill battle mode adds interesting mechanics to the mix its still absolutely packed with content its just that the first game was too so the impact is lessened slightly,1
commandos hd remaster is a disappointingly lacklustre port of a realtime tactics classic this is a game thats showing its age in many ways but with the right tweaks some decent control implementation and squashing of bugs it could have had its moment to shine with modern audiences as it is the irritations and annoyances expected in revisiting a game of this vintage are exacerbated to no end with shoddy unwieldy controls unexpected performance problems and a general lack of care the graphics have been updated here but everything else remains much as it was with the added frustration of bugs glitches and long loading times,1
empire of sin is undoubtedly an excellent idea a clever meshing together of management sim and turnbased tactical action thats set in a hugely compelling era of chicagos criminal history there are some cool mechanics here too the wellexecuted overworld map of the town the gangster black book with its complex relationships and those tense sitdowns with rival ganglords however all of this promise is held back by copious technical problems gamebreaking bugs and management and combat systems that feel halfbaked and scrappy there are more patches and updates planned and we desperately would like to see this one sort itself out but as things stand its virtually impossible to recommend and it remains to be seen if future updates can bash it into shape,1
fans of the original fitness boxing will feel at home with this sequel if a little disappointed that it isnt quite the evolution it could have been a few new instructors and an improved achievements system isnt quite enough to make up for the fact that this still suffers from many of its predecessors issues most notably its disappointingly small selection of music and the terrible unlicensed instrumental versions it provides,1
immortals fenyx rising tries to capture lightning in a bottle with its breath of the wildinspired gameplay but ends up being more of a lightning thief its not as nice to look at and the puzzles arent as satisfying still the combat is fun the storytelling is excellent and despite not being anywhere near as polished as nintendos effort it certainly does a passable impression if you crave more zelda and dont mind the offbrand version go for it but if for some reason you still havent played breath of the wild then thats the game to go for,2
just dance fails to ever feel like a fully fleshedout game especially for the price tag although the new tracks and the world dance floor mode are fun enough its hard to justify spending so much on a game that adds so little and expects you to purchase more with thinlyveiled ingame advertising and upselling if you love the series then youll be investing no matter what we say but we cant help but feel that just dance as a franchise has been resting on its laurels for far too long now,1
is kingdom hearts melody of memory for you well that depends on a variety of factors this is a game thats obviously designed as a love letter to longtime fans of the franchise but it also bears almost no resemblance at all to the gameplay that made the preceding titles such a hit as a rhythm game its a perfectly enjoyable and contentrich entry in the genre but a substantial amount of its meaning and appeal will be lost on rhythm fans who dont have a background with the previous games either way we think kingdom hearts melody of memory is certainly worth your time what we have here is a fun and engaging rhythm game with potentially hundreds of hours of replayability and a killer setlist of music to back it up,1
need for speed hot pursuit remastered teleports players back to more innocent times a decade ago when simply taking on a series of races was considered enough to keep players entertained many would argue its simplicity is a strength however and the reality is that despite the lack of depth its still a hugely entertaining time whether youre playing as a racer or a cop if you struggle to stay afloat with all the faffing around in modern games this oldschool dose of straightforward racing goodness is your life jacket,1
approached with the knowledge that this is a fullfeatured sidedish youll have a very good time hacking and slashing your way through calamity ganons minions in hyrule warriors age of calamity just remember that despite its sparkling presentation it is still not a zelda game what it is is a brilliant zeldainfused musou experience filled with varied and satisfying combat and breath of the wild additions that work beautifully within the boundaries of the warriors template the care and attention given to detail here is hugely impressive we found performance to be adequate and crucially it didnt affect our enjoyment throughout just be prepared for a slideshow once the pyrotechnics start in twoplayer coop in many ways hyrule warriors age of calamity could be exactly the game you need right now it offers a stopgap opportunity to revisit a world and characters we adore in a particularly calamitous year animal crossings calming alternative life was all well and good for a time but theres definite catharsis in grabbing the master sword sprinting out there and giving all the prowling nasties a sound thrashing its a story of old friends and enemies coming together to triumph over incredible adversity yep well take one of those now please,2
sniper elite is the best entry yet in this longrunning franchise with great big meaty missions stuffed to bursting point with nazis to snipe and stab in glorious slomo xray vision theres a newfound flexibility to the gameplay with karl now able to shimmy and scurry vertically around levels and enemy ai thats much more up to the task than in previous iterations there may be some slightly rough edges with duff writing naff characters and gameplay that doesnt change much from start to finish but overall this is playful snipers paradise that lands on switch in a truly impressive port its time to dust off that m springfield find a nice vantage point and get to blowing great big bloody holes in fascist heads the perfect antidote to,1
lovers of stardew valley and harvest moon may not find this game to be exactly the kind of farming they enjoy its more like you know actual farming with all the tiny changes in fertiliser recipes and water temperature that farming requires but for anyone who needs to practise mindfulness patience and appreciation for the small things all of them sakuna of rice and ruin may just be the therapy you need,2
fuser is a weird little thing that has fantastic moments turn into awful ones at the drop of a beat but when the awful moments are still incredibly fun does it really matter if you dont take fuser too seriously it could be one of the best rhythm games out there,1
cobra kai the karate kid saga continues might look like a lazy cashin but in reality its a strong effort that breezes through the cheesiness of its license by making said honking gorgonzola work for it with its brilliantly evocative s soundtrack paired with a cheeky silly style to match its cheeky silly gameplay with no shortage of levels plenty of playable characters and respective upgrades cobra kai the karate kid saga continues goes above and beyond the standards set by licensed games grab a friend and wax on wax off actually that sounds a bit rude,1
its the games commitment to accessibility that makes tropico a refreshing example of an underserved genre on the switch despite some irksome performance problems occasionally inconsistent pacing and some rather rough visuals the game is a lot of addictive fun to play and its cheerful ambience and compelling systems will keep you glued to your handheld paid dlc adds even more systems to the game but theres plenty here to keep you occupied for hours and hours wed recommend this to genre newbies as well as veterans a very impressive port with strong controls and a ui tailored brilliantly for handheld mode its a busy demanding game but never feels stressful and juggling your industry faction relationships and the mood of your citizens can be thoroughly absorbing if you can forgive the technical issues and an occasionally slack pace tropico is an easy recommendation,1
descenders is an addictive freeriding roguelite with plenty of content to keep players busy as they get to grips with its unique take on extreme biking action it may be a little rough around the edges in places and this switch port has certainly seen a graphical downgrade but the core riding controls well the framerate is solid and the procedurallygenerated nature of courses keeps things feeling fresh with a meaty campaign featuring eight diverse biomes a decent multiplayer component and those allimportant online leaderboards this ones a surprisingly robust package that comes highly recommended,1
bakugan champions of vestroia attempts to shoehorn the longrunning franchise into a pokémon lets gostyle affair aimed at younger players but does so with absolutely zero care or charm this is a lazy repetitive basic game that slowly erodes your patience and goodwill with sloppy mechanics a tiny roster of samey monsters and a world that reveals itself to be entirely devoid of character or life avoid,1
we realise its not a popular outlook games should generally be appreciated for what they are rather than blasted for what theyre not but thats very difficult to do in this case new n tasty is an acceptable imitation of abes oddysee but nothing more it has its moments of inspiration the stockyards stage is so beautifully realised that it can momentarily trigger that this is what i remember the original looking like false memory but its not enough to make up for the frustrations that come from the many many unnecessary changes even the sound of abes chant which once sounded mystical and otherworldly now just sounds like babbling were very torn as this is the only way to play abes oddysee on switch we begrudgingly recommend it but we do so with our arms folded and pouting harrumph,1
it might be more oldschool than other similar games but wallachia reign of dracula still offers rewarding action skilful level design and some excellent music with konami seemingly content to sleep on its popular castlevania series for the time being outside of smartphone games of course this alongside the likes of bloodstained curse of the moon and its sequel might be as close as were likely to get to a brandnew oldschool castlevania outing on switch its a good job then that migami games knows konamis franchise so well that it has created a truly convincing imitation but one which has enough ideas of its own to stand out from its inspiration,1
visually pikmin deluxe doesnt push the boat out much further than the original wii u version did where its changes lie are in its revamped control system and the addition of a new side stories mode neither are necessarily transformative enough to warrant double dipping if youre perfectly happy with your wii u copy but if youre one of the vast majority who dont have a wii u copy this switch update is unquestionably the best way to play it,2
transformers battlegrounds is far from the disaster you may expect it delivers a fun accessible turnbased tactical experience which is sadly a little too easy it might make a good game for someone new to the genre or kids looking to get involved but wed wager that even children might find this one a little too simple its a good effort and it does right by cybertrons finest but theres just not enough of it to justify the price when it goes on sale though itll be time to ahem roll out,1
if weve made this game sound thoroughly generic thats because it is but its not a disaster operation blackout has plenty to do with unlockable skins and modifiers to mess around with if you get into it and theres love for the gi joe property here so fans of the toys may get a kick out of it for everyone else though its a very difficult game to recommend if you want a thirdperson shooter on switch rebellions rogue trooper or zombie army trilogy are both better buys and now you know and knowing is half the actually no forget it were not even going to finish the thought were better than that,1
cloudpunk on switch is a hugely disappointing port that struggles technically and ultimately fails to deliver the game in a satisfactory manner on nintendos hybrid platform merge games have made drastic cuts all over with a massively reduced drawdistance sucking much of the life out of nivalis volumetric effects missing entirely pixellation rampant and a framerate that still chugs along in the face of all of these concessions if youve got a pc capable of playing this one wed highly recommend you play on that platform as this is an adventure thats well worth experiencing in its original form this particular version however should probably be avoided,1
zoids wild blast unleashed is a buttonmashy overly simplistic fighter thats aimed at young kids but doesnt even manage to lift its game enough to satisfy a junior audience on any level outside of very basic fan service theres a serious lack of modes or variety here especially for the notinsignificant price tag and what is included is let down by a lazy story mode and some shockingly simple enemy ai serious zoids fans may derive some fleeting pleasure from seeing their favourite characters battle it out but for everyone else this is a megahard sell and a fighter that absolutely fades into insignificance when compared to other examples of its genre,1
hardcore mecha is a superb d sidescrolling adventure that marries some spectacularly ott anime storytelling with explosively satisfying robot combat theres a surprisingly meaty story here set across eighteen wonderfully varied levels with plenty of depth to rpg elements allowing you to customise your mechs attack and defence capabilities an unlockable survival mode online pvp local multiplayer and mission rankings also add plenty of replayability to proceedings its a shame that this switch port has some framerate issues that can see intense battles stutter however if rocketpunch can rectify this with a patch pretty sharpish you can feel free to add a point or two to the score below,1
its difficult to score a release such as ben power trip as it belongs to a unique class of games that are known for being halfbaked and its primarily marketed towards children as far as tiein games go ben power trip is pretty decent the character variety makes for some nicely varied control styles while the openworld design allows for a strong gameplay loop centred around chasing quest that said ben power trip also has several glaring flaws like shallow gameplay and poor performance that really sink its image if your child happens to be a fan of the show ben power trip has enough redeeming qualities to be worth the punt but wed advise everyone else to take a pass,1
mario kart live home circuit is a startlingly authentic mixed reality recreation of nintendos most popular racing series which encourages you to be inventive with your course designs and does an excellent job of combining your realworld surroundings with the fantasy environments of the mushroom kingdom add in a second player or three and it becomes even more compelling the tech side of things is undeniably impressive and its impossible to not raise a smile the first time you play the question is how long that magic will last especially if your home limits your track designs and youve only got the budget to cover the cost of a single car,1
its a clichéd summary but avicii invector is better than it has any right to be and a fitting tribute to an artist who died tragically young its a huge boost if you already enjoy his music but even haters will have to respect the work thats gone into this fastpaced welldesigned rhythm action title its just a shame that tim bergling never had a chance to see it come together so nicely still until we get pet shop boys invector its the best singleartist music game weve had the pleasure of playing,1
lets sing queen is a straightup nofrills entry in the series that throws you into the legendary super groups awesome backcatalogue of hits across the same selection of modes youll be accustomed to from previous titles in the series there are absolutely no surprises here and a definite lack of variety when compared to other offerings in the franchise however with thirty mostly excellent tracks accompanied by their highly entertaining original music videos and an official app that turns your mobile phone into an impressively robust mic this is a solid good time for fans of the titans of rock karaoke fiends and anyone who just loves to warble along to some classic rock anthems while reenacting the best bits of live aid in the comfort of their own sitting room,1
while its possible to get into the retro groove of prinnys perilous platforming neither game does anything interesting enough to earn your patience and collecting two games together only reveals how much of the same ground is covered by both if anything additions in the sequel water down the formula if you simply must experience an unathletic penguin falling to its death again and again stick with the simpler original or better yet search for penguin falling over on youtube cheaper and a lot more entertaining,1
after the disaster that was the first game this is a remarkable turnaround with far more nickelodeon series represented improved track designs and a powerup customisation feature that lets you enhance your personal racing style nickelodeon kart racer has gone from one of the most disappointing racing series on the switch to probably the best one that doesnt feature plumbers or hedgehogs,1
is umihara kawase bazooka fun to play sure a little its inoffensive but it never grabbed us even though its a short game we never felt that burning desire to get to the end that is typically present in other titles there are many characters but none of them was really interesting cute yeah but not enough to mitigate the central problem that this isnt an interesting game were not sure why this is the direction the series has gone in but could it go back to the lovinglycrafted intricate rope courses please far be it for us to call for a regression but sometimes going back to the well is a good idea,1
it didnt have to be this way wayforward has worked minor miracles with licensed fare before see aliens infestation and the mummy demastered but this is work for hire of the most rotten kind showing total contempt for the fans it hopes to lure in with a bright likeable licence trollhunters is one of the less enjoyable things to happen to us this year given what a year its been that is quite a feat,1
the story here takes a back seat to the brilliant and compulsive dungeon crawling gameplay which should appeal even to those who dont tend to enjoy action rpgs no puzzle no battle and no single room ever outstays its welcome in ys origin resulting in one of the briskest easygoing games weve played in a long time sure the visuals could be better the overall length might be too short for hardcore rpg fans and theres a lot of grinding afoot but this remains a solid choice if youre a fan of this sort of thing an easy recommendation to pretty much anyone who has an interest in rpgs ys origin is perfect even if youve never touched a game in the series before now can we get ys the oath in felghana on switch too,1
the concept behind wwe k battlegrounds is a solid one but its let down time and time again by limited and repetitive combat dopey ai an excessively locked roster and a series of bewildering design choices that really should have been questioned at some point during production we hope it eventually gets an improved sequel but until then the switch is still lacking a proper main eventtier wrestling game,1
its a little ramshackle but care and craft has gone into the making of giraffe and annika theres nothing new here to speak of but its disparate genres work well together and we had a good time unravelling the mysteries of spica island a great game for kids and the young at heart were excited to see what developers atelier mimina do next,1
road to guangdong is a tough one to score because what it does right the character interaction and smallscale personal dramas are engaging enough to be worth praise its just that the mechanical glue holding it all together is close to disastrous at times as a result we cant give it a recommendation without enough caveats to make it sound like a warning you might like road to guangdong but even if you do youll like it despite it doing its level best to push you away,1
weve had an absolute blast playing through these three gems all over again especially now they look sharper than ever its a shame that the presentation is practically barebones with no bonus content beyond the soundtracks but there can still be no denying the quality of the games on offer here this is the beatles greatest hits of the video game world and is an absolute treat whether youre reliving it in hd or discovering it for the first time,2
rpg maker mv on switch is a stripped back and limited version of its pc counterpart that removes the ability to integrate your own custom elements as well as the use of plugins theres also very little in the way of help or tutorials and the ui can be clunky and slow to navigate however if you can make peace with these limitations whats here is still a vast hugely flexible bit of gamemaking software that provides those with the patience to get to grips with its systems almost limitless potential for rpgmaking fun we cant wait to see what players come up with over the coming weeks and months ahead and the free rpg maker mv player means that all switch owners get to share in the fun and perhaps be inspired to join in down the line if youre hugely serious about rpg making you may do best to stick to the pc version but if you just want to have some creative fun within the limits of the assets provided here youll have a blast,1
inertial drift is an acquired taste its interesting control method eventually pays off and feels rewarding when you simply complete a course unscathed but none of its modes are meaty enough to provide an solid package overall if youre the type who has no issue with racing over and over again to perfect your skills this could be a game for you fans of more conventional racers however may want to drift around it,1
immortal realms vampire wars is a reasonably fun turnbased strategy affair with an excellent setting and some unique ideas of its own the streamlined nature of its gameplay makes it pleasingly zippy stuff thats wellsuited to strategy newcomers but a lack of real depth a clunky ui and some dodgy enemy ai means the fun here is unfortunately pretty shortlived overall for anyone but genre enthusiasts and vampire fans,1
with a solid new story mode a greatly improved myteam mode and the same high quality of presentation that k now brings to the series on switch nba k is now the new definitive basketball game on the system the unwanted microtransaction ogre continues to loom over most of the package ever encouraging you to fork out more cash to accelerate your progress but as long as youre capable of ignoring this and have the patience to slowly improve your player and team organically the results will be infinitely more satisfying,1
jump force is a good time for a short time a simplistic buttonmasher that looks and sounds great in action but cant deliver in terms of providing players with any more than a handful of hours of dumb fun before it all becomes a bit of a bore if youre a huge fan of the shows involved or you like your fighting nice and easy youll get more than most out of things and jumping into an online battle if you can find one adds a little spice to the mix but overall this is a disappointingly dull onenote affair that doesnt do its roster of everpopular characters any sort of justice,1
pga tour k plays a solid golf game with enough flexibility in its control settings to appeal to both diehard simulation buffs and casual golf fans just looking for a quick round its reallife pro players are so underused they may as well not be in here and the game may not yet have the typical k sports trademarks the polished story mode the slick tvstyle presentation but it also isnt plagued with microtransactions and the result is a game that refreshingly just gets on with it,1
nexomon extinction does enough to make it somewhat distinct but the unique elements can also be its undoing it mostly succeeds in being a more deliberate and challenging take on pokémon but that difficulty can oftentimes come across as exhausting and artificial if you felt let down by sword and shield there may be aspects of nexomon you really enjoy but we cant help but feel that the slow pace of battles and lack of multiplayer features prevent it from being a true rival its really more like a cheap alternative but one thats arguably worth a look if youre a hardcore fan of game freaks famous franchise,1
no straight roads isnt a bad game at all but its one that consistently falls short of the tremendous potential that it often hints at the world characters music and overall idea of its gameplay are ripe for a groundbreaking beat em up game but this unfortunately is just a soso one performance problems camera issues and repetitive gameplay are all factors that hold this one back from greatness but these issues are often balanced out by the spectacular boss fights excellent soundtrack and charming writing wed recommend this one to beat em up fans looking for an interesting new entry in the genre but with the big caveat that you consider this releases flaws before taking the plunge its certainly a worthwhile experience but one that will likely disappoint if you come into it with the wrong expectations,1
if youve been curious about the property is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon infinite combate is a good way to get involved as it allows you to explore the first season of the anime and some supplementary material in an enjoyably interactive manner series veterans will also appreciate the opportunity to date their favourite characters in the extra mode as both bell and ais and the array of beautiful artwork and fun events to unlock provides good incentive for continued engagement as does the progression system which only really shows its depth once youve cleared the story its just a bit of a shame the game feels like it was developed on the cheap its likely some will find the simplistic dungeon graphics in particular somewhat offputting if you can look past that though this is a good adaptation of a wellloved series with plenty of content to keep you busy in the long term,1
skully isnt an entirely lost cause theres an entertaining enough puzzle platformer hidden underneath its myriad visual flaws it may be uglier than sin and you may be accompanied by an irritating voiceover throughout but youll still have some fun playing through it and the plot does resolve itself in a nice way by the end youll just need to be able to roll with a lot of annoyances to get there,1
at the end of the day fairy tail is not a great rpg shortcomings in storytelling pacing difficulty and performance all add up to make for a less than stellar experience which consistently seems to waste its potential the wellmade combat system and the adherence to the tone and content of the source material give occasional glimpses of the much greater rpg that fairy tail could be but alas its never really given the chance to spread its wings we wouldnt recommend you pick this one up especially given the wealth of excellent rpgs available on the eshop right now but we say that with the caveat that fans of the franchise will get a lot more out of this game than newcomers if you happen to be a fan fairy tail might be worth the punt if its on sale someday but otherwise wed encourage you to look into other games,1
rock of ages failed to impress us on almost any level its definitely a game with character and it could feasibly work its charms on you but in its drive to be different and unusual it seems to have neglected to be fun still it certainly has an audience broadly speaking you dont get to a second sequel without your game mattering to someone if you can muscle through the frustrations you might be able to roll with rock of ages but with so many other worthy titles on switch we cant say wed recommend it,1
paper mario the origami king tries to do something different with its combat system and to be honest we arent feeling it that doesnt mean the rest of the game isnt thoroughly entertaining however and while the puzzlebased battles arent quite what a new paper mario game needed they arent so awful that everything else shouldnt be experienced as a result it still isnt the new thousandyear door fans will have been hoping for but its still one of the funniest games in the series and its got a truly likeable companion character and while the combat is far from ideal the fact that we still thoroughly recommend the game regardless speaks volumes about every other aspect of it,1
story of seasons friends of mineral town offers up a perfectly satisfying and simple take on the farm sim genre heartwarming character interactions easy to grasp farming mechanics and a nice variety of side activities prove to make this release a potent and worthwhile entry in this longrunning series though its roots as a handheld game occasionally resurface and theres not a ton of new content added for this remake story of seasons friends of mineral town more than stands enough on its own as a quality game that deserves a spot in your switch library if youre looking for something to fill that postanimal crossing hole in your life or are just simply a fan of the farm sim genre in general dont miss out on this one,1
veterans of the first game wont be expecting a technical tourdeforce but deadly premonition still manages to underwhelm in pure performance terms however and this is a big however its a game with real character and its very tough to dislike even as you stutter your way around le carré on your skateboard if youve ever been intrigued by the original wed recommend giving this a go its janky and derivative yes but its also irresistibly wonderful and strange and theres no other video game quite like it,1
catherine full body is a fantastic revamp of a bonafide cult classic with an excellent new character and several new endings slickly inserted into an already highly entertaining narrative not to mention a slew of fun new modes this is the definitive version of an outstanding game if youve never played catherine before then youre in for an absolute treat and if you have wed say theres enough new content here to make it worth diving in all over again,1
trails of cold steel iii is another excellent addition to a franchise that gains so much of what makes it absorbing from the huge amount of background detail and worldbuilding thats been achieved in earlier entries in the series newcomers should be aware that taking the time out to play trails of cold steel i and ii is advised to get the absolute maximum amount of enjoyment out of this one but even if youre jumping in fresh theres still plenty to love here once you find your feet with a massive cast of wellwritten characters and tons of excellent combat and exploration spread across its epic running time this is a topnotch addition to the switchs library of jrpgs,2
considering the longreaching cultural impact that the spongebob cartoon has had on modern pop culture its nice to see that the franchise got at least one solid video game that properly represents the unique draw of spongebob and his friends though battle for bikini bottom doesnt bring anything new to the table as a d platformer its strong level design lighthearted tone and gorgeous remastered visuals make this one an easy recommendation that being said rampant technical issues hold the game back from true greatness which is a real shame given the quality in nearly every other area as a result this certainly isnt the game to unseat super mario odyssey but those of you that love a good collectathon d platformer will find plenty to love here,1
warborn takes the tried and tested advance wars formula adds a bunch of huge mechs some overwrought s animeinspired cutscenes and a story that sees you take control of four different commanders as you seek to restore order to the auros system theres nothing inspired or unique here raredrop games is playing it safe and straight down the line but fans of the genre and most especially fans of massive gundamesque robots will get a solid if unspectacular experience out of whats on offer with this one just dont expect any surprises,1
elements of burnout paradise are starting to show their age now but nobody can argue with the quality of its actual racing action if you can put up with its various niggles and quirks and dont mind the astronomical price relative to other systems its easily one of the most entertaining and certainly one of the fastest racing games on the switch,1
bioshock the collection stands as yet another fantastic port in the switchs evergrowing library combining three excellent games and all their dlc into one convincing package stable performance engrossing narratives fun gameplay and lots of content make this one an easy recommendation even if these releases show their age from time to time if youre looking for a good singleplayer shooter to pick up for your switch look no further than bioshock the collection wed give this one a high recommendation its tough to go wrong here,2
borderlands legendary collection is an excellent switch showing for this beloved series though its difficult to determine if the price is right sure theres an enormous amount of content here so youre certainly not being ripped off but its old content and these games are routinely extremely cheap on other services still its a technically excellent port of three expansive enjoyable shooters and theyre a perfect fit for the switch whether played alone or with pals the compulsive gameplay is terrific to dip into or get stuck into for a massive grinding session if youve somehow never played borderlands before you cant go wrong with this set if you have but want to try a different character class on the bus ride home nows your chance,2
the outer worlds is a hugely entertaining falloutinspacestyle rpg adventure filled with wonderfully vibrant locations excellent companions zippy and hilariously brutal combat and a ton of wellwritten characters to meet as you attempt to save the colony of halcyon virtuos has made the expected tweaks to graphics in order to keep things as smooth as possible with this switch port and although things can look and feel a little rough in docked mode in handheld this is a supremely enjoyable experience thats entertained us just as much this time around as when we played it at launch and comes highly recommended to fans of the genre,1
the xcom collection on switch is the fullfat xcom and xcom war of the chosen experience virtuous has had to knock the graphics right down to the lowest setting theres plenty of framerate issues and bugs that weve already encountered on other platforms and the notinsignificant but hopefully very shortly patched problem with the games character creation pool but this is still a highly playable version of the game if you can make peace with some stuttering and long loading times and arent too offended by pretty ugly textures here and there youll be rewarded with one of the very best turnbased tactical titles currently available xcom is nothing short of a masterpiece and now you can play it on the go which we reckon is well worth any sacrifices made here,1
compilation games like clubhouse games worldwide classics always have a variety of hits and misses depending on your own personal taste but theres a wide enough variety of board card and action games here that youre sure to find a number that will appeal to you everythings presented with charm and warmth terriblywritten cutscenes aside and theres an enormous amount of content on offer whether you plan on playing solo or with others the perfect game for lockdown quite possibly,1
mortal kombat finally realised a true mortal kombat experience on nintendo hardware and with mortal kombat aftermath nintendo switch players get to experience this full expansion in all its glory the fivechapterlong story mode isnt essential but it does a nice job of weaving the nonthirdparty dlc characters into the narrative with shang tsung still managing to steal the show the three additions to the roster certainly wont set it alight but fujin alone does bring a few dimensions to the party its a fun expansion but the asking price is still a little too high at launch,1
simply put theres almost nothing one can reasonably complain about with xenoblade chronicles definitive edition what we have here is an already excellent jrpg that has been improved in nearly every conceivable way short of a complete reimagining on top of the fantastic story enjoyable combat and incredible world design monolith soft has included an entirely new epilogue story arc while somehow improving upon and polishing up nearly everything in the base game from progression systems to visuals to ui design xenoblade chronicles definitive edition is easily one of the greatest rpgs available on the switch to date and will no doubt stand the test of time it goes without saying that if you were ever a fan of the original or of rpgs in general you absolutely must get this game for your collection as soon as you reasonably can even if you wouldnt consider yourself a fan we would still strongly encourage you to think about adding this one to your collection as this is the standard against which most rpgs should be judged,2
while milestones twowheeled efforts offer a more polished twowheeled simulation experience kylotonns latest addition to the genre is still a recommended purchase for hardcore superbike superfans the overall improvements to the handling model make taking on the legendary isle of man tt course a far more rewarding experience than previous attempts while the improved career mode makes the buildup to that infamous race far more agreeable to less experienced riders while its still very rough around the edges in terms of presentation isle of man tt ride on the edge is still a far smoother ride than the original and another decent addition to switchs growing motorbike repertoire,1
satazius is the pick of the pack and almost worth the asking price in itself but if you enjoy the shmup genre then shmup collection is a package that will keep on giving theres nothing in the way of extras outside of each games respective practicestage select mode and a tate mode for wolflame for those with a flip grip but you wont find yourself wanting this is an impressive bundle of joy at a very competitive price we just hope itll be followed by a second instalment astro port has a lot of awesome games in its catalogue and wed love to see them find a second home on switch,1
thanks to some welcome changes to its core systems mainly the improved battle mechanics and the great onus on story content naruto shippuden ultimate ninja storm road to boruto is the most accomplished and enjoyable instalment in the series yet while its certainly more for the hardcore naruto crowd its nevertheless a meaty package with an impressively vast roster a huge amount of unlockable content and the addition of the filmtie in for the baruto storyline if you love all things naruto this fourth instalment is a musthave addition to your ninja collection,1
marrying astonishing spectacle and overwrought drama the wonderful remastered is one of the most memorable action games youll ever play its delirious excesses come with a price and its one thats at little harder to forgive this time with the originals flaws remaining untouched and a few compromises made to accommodate the wii u versions dualscreen setpieces but for all its minor frustrations its a game that rewards patience and perseverance grit your teeth through its control quirks and camera foibles and relish the giddy spectacle of a game that doesnt know when to stop,1
if youre looking for a retro shooter that isnt actually a yearold port of a n game then ion fury is the timetravelling love letter from the past youve been waiting for while its weapons and boss fights wont leave much of an imprint on your memory the speed and intensity of its gunfights and the intricacy of its level designs more than make up for it if you want to be punished and rewarded by the shooter principles of old this is the newold fps for you,1
a relentlessly impressive experience ministry of broadcast is always enjoyable often excellent and very clearly a labour of love some will find the exacting nature of the controls rubs them the wrong way but if youre looking for an oldschool experience that isnt a selfconscious throwback and has a narrative you can get your teeth into its an unambiguous recommendation from us its not perfect the ingame dialogue is wellwritten but rough around the edges with plentiful typos and grammar confusion but thats not enough to distract from ministry of broadcasts terrific level design and superb visuals nothing new here but what it offers is quite simply a very very very very good cinematic platformer,1
played in the mindset of having oldfashioned fun rather than pushing your gaming skills to their limits moving out has quite a lot to offer it looks good sounds good and plays well its just a shame there isnt a little bit more to get your teeth into its a lot of fun causing chaos with friends throwing toasters through windows or trying to balance that last lampshade on the back of an overstocked removal truck but its just not resonant enough as a cooperative experience to stick in your mind a very good effort but in our view just too slight to be a lasting classic,1
trials of mana proves itself to be a successful revival of a lost classic smartly infusing new design and content where necessary while still maintaining the spirit of the original multithreaded storylines an enjoyable combat system and flexible character progression combine to make this one a fantastic experience from start to finish even if occasional performance problems hinder the experience somewhat wed give trials of mana a high recommendation to rpg fans and newcomers alike theres plenty here to love for both camps and we hope that this release could act as a blueprint for future entries in the mana series,2
the odds are quite good that you will never get the chance to play cooking mama cookstar and thats probably for the best beyond its status as a curiosity item in the wake of the mess surrounding its release there is absolutely nothing about cooking mama cookstar that justifies the price of admission extremely shallow gameplay terrible motion controls and some of the worst voice acting weve heard in a modern video game make for an experience thats woefully average at best and outright unenjoyable at the worst if you happen to be fortunate enough to come across a copy you could always pick it up purely for its resale value and as a conversation piece but do yourself a favour and dont waste your time actually playing it,1
from a technical perspective the switch port of disaster report summer memories is an absolute mess narratively and artistically however its one of the most fascinating games in recent memory its emotionally engaging exploration of a disastrous incidents human aftermath is about as far as its possible to get from the hollywood blockbuster treatment and its all the better for it if you can fight past the technical shortcomings which its worth stating are pretty considerable then youll find an experience thats totally unique on switch and thats no mean feat when you consider the depth of the consoles library,1
if youve played a warriors game before then youve basically played one piece pirate warriors thin story okay graphics and somewhat shallow but satisfying action gameplay are all par for the course here not to mention a lions share of content to work through if youve ever been curious what this subgenre is all about this is a great place to jump in with its easily approachable gameplay and that lovably goofy one piece aesthetic if youre a long time fan wed encourage you to ask yourself how much you want more of the same and decide based on that one piece pirate warriors is the furthest thing from reinventing the wheel but it sure has its unique and addictive gameplay loop down to a science,1
zombie army trilogy is a solid coop shooter with a fantastically pulpy setup that does exactly what it sets out to pitting you and up to three other players against an almost endless army of gloriously gory undead nazis and letting you snipe shotgun and kick every last one of them to pieces it may be of somewhat limited appeal when played solo but gather together a crew or join forces with randoms online and this one springs to life providing countless hours of admirably straightforward skullsmashing fun,1
while saints row the third proved a more inconsistent port mainly because it was a much older game saints row iv reelected fares far better with better performance minimal input lag and a refreshingly solid output in handheld mode its gunplay is always going to be messy and its unashamed sense of humour will undoubtedly offend some but having such an activity rich experience running so well on your handheld console isnt to be sniffed at and with so much extra content available in the reelected package switch players have another longterm investment on their hands,1
while it inherits many of the problems that made the first game feel quite insubstantial my hero ones justice is a still a notable step forwards thanks to the introduction of new modes and a far meatier story mode the action can still be a little messy and it lacks the precision offered by many other animeinspired fighters but with over characters from the canon to choose from an impressively deep customisation system and a constant stream of rewards this is a still an authentic tribute to the series that my hero academia fans will get the most kicks from fighting game aficionados will probably go elsewhere but for those looking for a fun and mostly chaotic fighter will find an enjoyable experience here,1
animal crossing new horizons takes animal crossing and not only drags it back onto home consoles but improves upon every single facet imaginable theres more to do more to see more to change more to mould and more to love fans and firsttime players are going to find themselves losing hours at a time gathering materials creating new furniture and making their island undeniably theirs every moment is unashamedly blissful with excellentlywritten characters that truly feel alive and an island paradise that gives back infinitely more than you put in back when animal crossing new leaf hit the shelves all those years ago and created a whole new generation of fans many people were wondering how nintendo could possibly top it but here we have our answer this is a masterpiece that has been well worth waiting for,2
whether or not langrisser i ii is the release for you ultimately depends on your affection for decidedly simpler but more straightforward rpgs this isnt a release to shock and awe you with its innovative mechanics or boundarybreaking storytelling but if youre feeling up for an oldfashioned nofrills srpg romp langrisser i ii has what youre looking for in spades corny storytelling and occasionally sluggish gameplay aside both of the games present here hold up reasonably well helped in no small part by the minor gameplay tweaks and remastered assets wed give langrisser i ii a light recommendation its not exactly a musthave title but theres plenty to love here and its sure to keep you busy for quite some time,1
for some the technical jank may be enough to put them off engaging with dead or school fully thatd be a real shame though allow yourself to get wrapped up in the narrative the mechanics the piles of loot the beautifully designed stages and the games wonderful sense of style and theres something truly special to enjoy here an honesttogoodness hidden gem if ever there was one,1
under night inbirth exelateclr is a super slick fastpaced fighter that manages to successfully straddle the line between being instantly accessible and welcoming for newcomers and indepth enough to satisfy hardcore fight fans its lineup of twentyone fighters are much more exciting than their anime stylings may suggest and the chronicles mode gives fans of the visual novel element of the game plenty to sink their teeth into with the most comprehensive training and tutorial modes weve ever encountered in a fighting game this is easily one of the most wellrounded satisfying and instantly engaging brawlers on switch and even with an online mode which seems to be in need of some attention theres plenty for fans of the genre to sink their teeth into here,1
both the psikyo shooting stars alpha and psikyo shooting stars bravo collections are pretty close in value to one another while psikyo shooting stars alpha is perhaps the better of the two due to the consistent quality of the strikers games we also harbour a soft spot for the gunbird series on psikyo shooting stars bravo especially gunbird sengoku cannon is so poor it might as well not exist in the collection but samurai aces episode and gunbarich are stronger than alphas sol divide and zero gunner so which collection is better is mostly going to come down to preference between the gunbird or strikers series another constant between them sadly is the high level of input lag and lack of bonus material to make the collection really stand out,1
a beautiful game with potentially hundreds of hours of gameplay theres still no getting away from the fact that this is a yearold gba title at its core the dungeon crawling genre has evolved over the years to try and make things feel less repetitive and while pokémon mystery dungeon rescue team dx does add some features to try to modernise the process a bit they tend to fall flat its still fun in bursts it just gets samey after a while,1
theres something here for everyone in rune factory special but its greatest strength is how it ties together everything into one thoroughly enjoyable package varied gameplay strong writing and an emphasis on progressing at your own pace make this one of the best farm sim games available on the switch to date wed give this one a high recommendation to anyone looking for an engaging yet undemanding game for their switch with that being said those of you who have already played it on the ds may want to pause before buying it again as the new features alone do little to justify the cost of entry once more either way rune factory special proves itself to be a modern classic and a shining example of how good this genre can be make sure to give it a shot,1
mega man zerozx legacy collection is everything that you couldve hoped it to be this is ultimately six great mega man games presented to you with a slew of customizable features extra content and quality of life updates if youre a fan of either mega man or sidescrolling action games in general you owe it to yourself to give this release a go and see what all the fuss is about these are hard and occasionally frustrating games but they offer up some rewarding actionheavy gameplay that even today stands among the best of its class dont pass this one up its definitely worth the punt,2
metro redux is a topnotch firstperson survival horror package that delivers countless hours of thrilling stealth combat all wrapped up in a superb story these are two of the most atmospheric games youll likely play set in a beautifully detailed depiction of postapocalyptic russia a games has delivered a port that stands shoulder to shoulder with alien isolation as the very best weve seen on switch so far an almost flawless experience which should absolutely be right at the top of any fps or survival horror fans mustbuy list this is essential stuff,1
while samurai shodown has taken a very slight visual hit as part of its protracted journey to switch the most important thing is that the core fps gameplay remains intact the downgrade is most noticeable when playing in handheld mode but its still incredibly enjoyable and compelling especially if you appreciate fighting games that exercise your mind as well as your fingers the singleplayer portion of the game is perhaps a little too lacking by standards and some of the ideas dont work as well as they should dojo mode were looking at you but with its appealing cast of fighters decent multiplayer options and a host of new gameplay ideas to keep things feeling fresh samurai shodown is nonetheless a confident and assured update of a classic fighting game series and bodes well for snks future attempts to resurrect its enviable stable of titles for the modern era,1
the highest praise we can give two point hospital is that it feels impossible not to have fun with it its zanier than an episode of scrubs and shot through with some of the most satisfying sim gameplay of any title this generation it may be heavily inspired by games that came before but in truth it feels like a natural evolution of bullfrogs title surpassing it in so many ways and is an endlessly enjoyable addition to the switchs thirdparty library its also arguably the best version of the game so far given its visual similarity to other versions and being able to carry the experience around with you makes it even more appealing and addictive,1
code realize guardian of rebirth is a solid visual novel with a unique steampunk setting and a bunch of wellwritten and pretty likeable lead characters the mystery surrounding cardias bizarre situation combined with suitors based on wellknown thcentury literary characters is an engaging mix and even if youre not really all that bothered with romancing a bunch of lads theres plenty here to keep you reading and exploring the various routes and scenarios until youve seen everything this ones got to offer,1
darksiders genesis is for us the best entry in the series in terms of its mix of satisfyingly meaty hackandslash action and huge levels filled with secrets puzzles and platforming with its fully coop campaign unlockable arena mode and apocalyptic difficulty feeding into that addictive creature core grinding theres an absolute ton here for fans of the series and newcomers alike to get stuck into this switch version may suffer some slight blurriness and fps hiccups in portable mode but if you can make peace with these problems this is a highly entertaining action game at a very reasonable price,1
warriors orochi was a solid if uninspired musou game and this ultimate edition fleshes things out with some new characters and modes significantly beefs up the story and tweaks the central gameplay here and there however the additions that have been made sometimes feel like the least amount of effort that was possible the new playable characters although fun are pretty much slapped in without any fanfare new weapons dont even have unique skins and infinity mode feels like a bit of a missed opportunity warriors orochi ultimate is definitely an improvement over the vanilla version of the game and absolutely the way to go if youre keen but have yet to pick it up but its also a rather disappointingly small one that comes at a pretty steep price for loyal fans who are forking out to upgrade from the base version,1
this collection could be recommended for those who want to casually drop a few credits in a psikyo game here and there and are not going to become too concerned about learning or clearing the game if you are the type of player who respects the original versions of these classics however and wants to experience the feel of the intended gameplay the psikyo shooting stars alpha is not a worthwhile purchase it is painful to say but that money would be better spent on a properly ported shmup collection like the darius cozmic collection or even on the old ps and saturn releases of these games if you are not interested in emulation we understand some players will be upset by the chosen review score but please keep in mind that giving this noeffort collection a high review score also devalues the work of other collections and developers who are putting in the time and effort to honour the playability of the games they are selling,1
snack world serves up a beautifully presented helping of dungeon crawling garnished with generous amounts of humour and charm its character is also its saving grace because it helps keep your interest when the actual mechanics start to feel repetitive or to milk the food analogy further its outer shell is so endearing that youll still enjoy consuming it even when you can tell its starting to get a little stale,1
if youve played the previous instalments and the series and you appreciate updated rider rosters the introduction of female riders and the improved physics for those that play on more realistic settings then monster energy supercross the official videogame will definitely appeal but with a completely absent online community this port is a tougher sell over those on pc and other console platforms still despite its shortcomings this is a solid twowheeled racer that retains all the usual modes and extras and runs like a treat in handheld mode just dont expect it to feel massively different from the previous instalment,1
ash of gods redemption looks and sounds the part its a beautiful thing to behold easily matches its most obvious inspiration in this regard and will obviously be very tempting to fans of the genre and especially the banner saga as a result however beneath this shiny surface its a mess a combination of badly implemented and nonsensical mechanics a poor story terrible and often juvenile writing and a constant desire to stomp its players into the dirt make it a real pain to struggle through its a hugely punitive game which would be fine if it played by the rules but it doesnt combat here relies too much on luck and uncontrollable aspects which rob you of the opportunity to use actual skill and savvy to overcome the tough tests youll be put through if you want to make your game tough fine go for it but you need to ensure the systems that underpin that toughness are up to serious scrutiny and unfortunately here they really arent,1
tokyo mirage sessions fe encore is one of the most colourful approachable and downright endearing rpgs youll find on the switch its new story chapter music tracks and character assists improve on the original to an extent but not enough to greatly affect its overall quality thankfully what was there was already fantastic meaning those who missed out on it the first time around really have no reason not to get stuck in now,2
overall blacksad under the skin is both a faithful adaptation and a frustrating example of modern adventure game pitfalls fans of the original comics will enjoy seeing blacksad himself brought to life so accurately but some inconsistent performances in the voiceover department and some frustratingly unresponsive controls make it a far less enjoyable experience theres a really intriguing mystery to unfold and solve but with some technical problems and a little too much blurring for our liking youll have to grit your teeth if you really want to crack this case on the go,1
its difficult to determine who brain trainings audience is the casual audience who would have happily bought a cheap ds for the original wont buy the far more expensive switch and existing switch owners can find a slew of other brain games that may not be better but are certainly cheaper whats here is entertaining enough but youre likely to have lost interest within a month if ever there was a series that nintendo should have turned into a mobile game instead its this one,1
esp rade psi goes beyond the industry standard and lays waste to pretty much every other shmup on the nintendo switch this is even better than the mighty ikaruga which many switch fans see as the best example of the genre available on the system while personal preference obviously enters into things we feel that esp rade psi is the superior port thanks to all the comprehensive features and attention to detail plus with arcade plus mode removing the previous frustrations of the troublesome boss milking scoring system esp rade psi cleans up to be a massively underrated classic that effortlessly earns the title of the best shmup on the nintendo switch hopefully this superb package will see a western release in the fullness of time so an even wider audience can sample its myriad delights,2
buried deep within neverwinter nights loins remains an entertaining engrossing and lengthy rpg adventure bundled with oodles of extra campaigns and oneoff adventures but to enjoy that youre going to have to put up with some of the most stuttery bugriddled nonsense weve seen on the switch fun and frustrating in equal measure,1
assassins creed the rebel collection has come as something of a surprise to us after the disappointment of assassins creed iii remastered here are two excellent swashbuckling epics ported to nintendos console in fine fashion black flag is a revelation in portable mode and looks and performs almost flawlessly as you blast your way around the caribbean on edward kenways captivating pirate adventures rogue although it struggles to keep up slightly here and there is always eminently playable and together with the excellent freedom cry they give assassins creed fans something theyve wanted for a very long time now this is handheld assassins creed at a standard we werent particularly sure wed ever see on switch,1
considering how integral the backandforth tussle between el patron and dea is to the show recreating such a violent game of chess in tactics form seems like a match made in heaven but even with some welcome gameplay twists namely those realtime kill shots and counteractions the slow nature of its singleunit turn mechanic and the totally unremarkable ai makes this generous offering of missions far less exciting than it should be as a genre a turnbased tactics setup really suits the cat and mouse nature of this reallifeinspired cartel war its just a shame certain elements let it down,1
an inoffensive minigame collection that tries to deliver a little of that disney charm but it feels like the type of lacklustre wii title that was abundant during that consoles golden era with the availability of super mario party or even carnival games its hard to recommend this unless youre a really big fan of tsum tsums not disney just the tsum tsums,1
raging loop is a promisingly creepy title in the vein of silent hill and danganronpa that fails to deliver thanks to the sluggish pace of its storytelling and lack of meaningful choices fans of visual novels will no doubt get something out of this but the rest of us will lose patience early on if youre looking for some light reading which you can dip in and out of over the space of a few months or so then you might find something to like here but while raging loop may lure you in with its many branching storylines youll be frustrated long before you reach the end,1
wrc is a hugely enjoyable rally game perhaps the strongest in the history of this longrunning series but it arrives on switch in a disappointing state playing exclusively in docked mode youll be able to enjoy whats on offer here without any technical issues to hold you back with developer kylotonn making the necessary graphical sacrifices to keep everything moving at a solid fps honestly if youre planning on playing docked only feel free to stick another two stars on the score below however once you switch to portable its another story one all too familiar to switch owners who already suffered through vrally heavily pixelated graphics aggressive resolution scaling scenery popin and an unreliable framerate all ensure that there are just too many barriers in the way of you freely enjoying the topnotch rally action,1
sparklite is a fantastic roguelite adventure title that provides a nostalgia hit for d zelda fans without feeling like a bad copy the games rich world fuses mechanics and story without it feeling obnoxious and the cast of characters are lovable and wellrounded with each one standing out from the crowd by the end players will be begging for more even if the final road is a little bumpy with some awkward difficulty spikes geodia is a world no one wants to leave by the end but its one thats enjoyable to return to again and again,1
if youre new to visual novels and curious then go somewhere else first root letter last answer could put you off the genre for life but if youre a visual novel fan youve played all the other interesting ones on the switch and you absolutely cannot wait for another and if youve considered maybe just going outside or watching tv or lying on the floor and staring at the ceiling and you still cant wait for another then you could take a look at root letter and just hope you find it so bad its good,1
pokémon sword and shield succeed in bringing some new ideas to the table but theyre also somewhat guilty of not pushing things far enough whats done right is done right but whats done wrong feels like its come from a decadeold design document there are moments contained within that are best the series has ever been but this joy is at times spoiled by contrasting moments that left us disappointed and did not match up to the rest of what the rest of these games can offer what weve got here is an experience full of highs and lows from the unadulterated wonder and joy of seeing a brandnew pokémon in a stadium full of cheering crowds to the monotonous and draggedout dialogue we just wanted to skip the wonders of exploring the wild area feels like the true evolution of the series but even this brave stride forward is balanced out by the inclusion of restrictive and boring routes from games of old the niggling issues are impossible to ignore then but on the whole pokémon sword and shield are a solid start to the hd generation of pokémon games but theres ample room for improvement with the next outing,1
bubble bobble friends is a great modern addition to the series it offers a solid balance of fun and challenge with high replayability due to the threetier scoring system and collectables as well as the inclusion of the original game in the series the focus on teamwork will be wonderful for families and friends looking for some coop fun but the lack of online play and the absence of any real competitive features could limit its longevity however given how much fun this is to play these complaints seem a little spiteful what weve got here is a quite brilliant reimagining of a stonecold classic which understands that amazing gameplay is timeless and doesnt need totally overhauling to keep it relevant in the modern age,1
while this second trilogy compilation offers diminishing returns in terms of quality resident evil still shines brightly even if the switch port deserved a little more care and attention the real draw here will be that game in physical form and as always it is very disappointing to see that the other two titles must be downloaded if re is all you care about getting the fifth and sixth entries as downloadable extras isnt a bad deal and theres fun to be had in the latter two games although youll arguably need a friend to get the most out of them even resident evil much maligned as a series low point can be fun if youre after a straightup coop action shooter as a collection of the action branch of mainline resident evil games this isnt a bad offering at all just make sure youve got the necessary memory space for the downloads,1
we always knew garfield was something of a rebel but taking a bad sixyearold game making it even worse to play pretending its a sequel and charging switch owners more than double the price to suffer it is some pretty subversive stuff the original garfield kart is extremely cheap on steam considering this is a more broken version of the same game you might as well buy that instead even if you dont have a pc youll have wasted less money,1
just dance is a celebration of the series tenth anniversary in more ways than one with years worth of releases all leading up to a formula that has truly been perfected and a decent new song list to boot youll want to be subscribed to just dance unlimited to get the most out of your purchase however and a combination of your needs budget and access to previous titles makes the decision much more difficult than it should be newcomers to the series wont find a better experience out there but seasoned players might want to think about saving some cash and sticking with their current setup,1
new super luckys tale is a solid port of an underrated platformer with a greatly improved camera its a little on the short side and may not provide much of a challenge to more hardened gamers and if you already own it on xbox one there really isnt enough new here to warrant a second purchase but what makes it worth a look is its uncanny ability to make you smile and this is something that cant be overlooked especially in modern times,1
laytons mystery journey katrielle and the millionaires conspiracy deluxe edition proves itself to be a strong puzzle game in its own right although compared to the highs of its predecessors it doesnt nearly hold up as well even so the pleasant visuals wonderful writing and mostly strong puzzle design make this an easy sell even if the occasional missteps in some of the puzzle answers and the lack of compelling new features for this rerelease prove to be drawbacks wed give this a recommendation to anybody looking for a slowerpaced game that still demands lots of attention its an excellent winding down before bed sort of game and though it might not fully live up to the series legacy were still excited for whatever level is planning next for kat,1
its events provide welcome variety and there are far more hits than misses in its lineup but once youre finished with mario sonic at the olympic games tokyo s fourhour story mode it becomes notably less enticing for solo players with no real incentives or unlockables to aim for this should be considered a strictly multiplayer affair if you want to still be playing it by the time the actual tokyo olympics roll around,1
xeno crisis feels like a lost classic from a bygone era of gaming a brilliant twinstick arena shooter which wears its influences on its blooddrenched sleeve the stern challenge may prove to be offputting for casual players but it rewards dedication with some of the most intense and addictive blasting action you can find in the genre convince a fellow player to join in and youve got the makings of a coop classic,1
lets sing works as a karaoke video game and the pointfocused levellingup system and subsequent unlockables add a sense of satisfaction as you beat your score unlock avatars and the use of songs in other play modes aside from all this lets sing has a real sense of fun mediocre singers arent punished by crowd boos or negative sound bites the easy to follow onscreen prompts are vibrant and the colour schemes as well as the full music videos playing behind each track definitely give off a party vibe admittedly the game at release is clearly aimed towards teenagers with its dancepop heavy tracklist but some wellchosen dlc packs should allow players to tweak the game to their own preferred styles,1
dusk diver is a solid musuostyle hackandslash action game that throws you into some massive battles with a fun and flexible combat system at your disposal its narrative is fairly derivative but its bolstered by a strong wisecracking cast of highly likeable characters that we really hope we get to see more from in the future its a shame that its let down somewhat by a pretty but very empty setting in ximending and outside of combat missions much of what you do is simple padding and busywork however if youre a fan of this type of action game theres plenty to enjoy here taking on endless hordes of chaos beasts unleashing the powers of the kunlun gods and stringing together screenfilling attacks until that combo counter explodes,1
atelier ryza lifts the series to new heights with a reinvigorated newcomerfriendly alchemy system and an excellent combat overhaul the new graphics engine looks glorious and runs beautifully on nintendos console the story is thoughtfully paced and heartfelt and the traditionally slow early hours do a fantastic job of detailing ryzas journey from complete beginner to master alchemist gust has done a brilliant job of taking this longrunning franchise and making it appeal to the mainstream more than ever here and if youve ever been tempted to give the world of atelier a try this is a perfect jumpingon point,2
disney classic games aladdin and the lion king is an unfortunately tough release to recommend though digital eclipse did a fantastic job of emulating these releases and throwing all manner of extra features in to sweeten the deal the hard truth is that the two games that lie at the core of this package just havent stood the test of time all that well aside from the excellent presentation quality the years have not been at all kind to these releases and given the wealth of similar retro content available on the switch eshop now its tough to recommend that a newcomer pick them up if you played these games as a kid and want a nice walk down memory lane this is by far and away the best way you could possibly experience them and thats not something to be dismissed out of hand bearing that in mind wed give this release a light recommendation to those who are willing to shell out some cash for pure nostalgia if you dont fall into that camp you should probably steer clear,1
back in the day we gave the wii version a crushing score and said if the controls were good then you could double the score little did we know that over a decade later our words would ring almost true with more usable controls you can finally enjoy this batch of levels for what they are but the wider game is let down by weird leaderboard decisions and those lacklustre minigames the best monkeyinaball game since super monkey ball sure but not quite a return to the series heyday,1
vampyr is a brilliant take on the vampire fantasy focusing more on drama relationships and inner conflicts than on sucking blood the temptation at its core can lead to frustration as the challenging boss fights feel designed to urge you towards killing more innocent npcs anyone attempting a nokill playthrough may struggle unless theyre willing to invest the time but if youre enjoying the story and characters its time well spent,1
luigis mansion is not only a graphical powerhouse and showcase for next level games unrivalled mastery of video game animation its also an immense helping of spooky fun as well the amount of care and consideration poured into every facet of the game is abundantly clear and it all results in one of the most enjoyable and attractive switch titles of the year its also the undisputed high point of a franchise which following this sterling release will hopefully get even more love and attention from nintendo fandom and the gaming community as a whole,2
doraemon story of seasons is an enchanting relaxing romp through a world that is so much simpler than ours with gorgeous visuals and a neverending list of things to do its unlikely that youll get bored while playing it while its slowpace might turn off some its incredibly welcome to play a game where the fate of the world isnt at stake and you can instead just sit down and decide what plants you might want to grow for the upcoming year,1
its hard to recommend a game such as disgaea complete as its the sort of game that you either love or hate there really is no inbetween on one hand you have a mountain of engaging content oodles of complex gameplay systems to learn and a refreshingly irreverent tone to keep it all interesting for dozens of hours on the other hand these things are presented to you in an overwhelming and difficult to digest manner that will only appeal to a small subset of players all that being said wed give disgaea complete a high recommendation to veteran fans of the genre who are looking for something specifically geared to them for newcomers wed still recommend it but wed also encourage you to do your research and make sure youre prepared for what will likely feel like a demanding experience at first,1
destiny connect ticktock travelers is very much a my first jrpg typeaffair its story is overlyschmaltzy and safe the game world is small and disappointingly sterile and its cast of bad guys wont give you too much trouble over the course of its short running time however the combat here is entertaining stuff intuitively laid out and clearly explained its filled with fun skills and makes light and breezy work out of systems that more grownup jrpgs tend to get bogged down in it has a likeable central cast of characters and although there are many more exciting games of its ilk available on switch it does do a commendable job in providing a safe starting point for younger players looking to sink their teeth into the genre for the first time,1
aeternoblade ii is a mess of overlycomplex mechanics and illfitting systems that struggles at all times to keep up with itself its core combat is solid but its marred by input lag slow animations messy enemy placement and a struggling framerate the timebased mechanics are far too numerous confusing and tedious while its long and winding storyline delivered by some of the worst voiceacting weve ever heard is almost totally nonsensical somewhere under all of the technical problems and confusion here theres a solid game but theres just far too much jank for players to be expected to wade through to get there and its impossible to recommend that you commit yourself to trying,1
digimon story cyber sleuth complete edition is a contentpacked rpg with plenty to see and do its evolution system feels wholly unique when compared to another monsterbreeding game series you might find on nintendo hardware and while the grind may be too much for some its comfortably one of the best creaturecatchers on the switch although pokémon still holds the crown of course,1
a hat in time is a hugely enjoyable take on the classic d platformer the tight familiar controls and varied innovative levels result in one of the most fascinating and entertaining games out there the issues with performance and the camera do little to wipe the smile from our faces while playing through this if you adore the likes of super mario and banjokazooie then youll fall utterly in love with a hat in time,2
spirit hunter ng itself is a really great game steeped in the traditions of japanese horror with a creepy plot and likeable and intriguing characters it is dark and brutal yet never needlessly so and the horror always plays out in the context of infusing its antagonists with real depth and relatability,1
zombieland double tap road trip is everything youve come to expect from a lazy movie tiein its gameplay is mechanically competent but its bland beyond belief short cynical and lazy it has the most tenuous of links to the actual film it portrays and is ultimately a very basic twinstick shooter with a tiredlooking zombieland skin tossed carelessly on top it also costs far more money than it has any right to if this was a free mobile game you might get an hour or two of braindead timewasting out of it but as an almost full price console release its pretty much indefensible,1
if youre a gym addict you probably shouldnt throw out your membership card just yet but for everyone else looking to get fitter this is a fantastic way to do it that wont bore you senseless play it properly and youll definitely feel it the next morning a sure sign that its at least doing you some good while the compelling adventure mode with its rpg elements will ensure that youll keep coming back for more,2
killer queen black does for nintendo switch what towerfall ascension did for ps offering up a d multiplayer extravaganza thats easy to pick up but devilishly tricky to master the support for local multiplayer through split joycons andor wireless play really sells this as a crazy couch play experience while the inclusion of online play and a spectate mode gives room for a potentially vibrant competitive scene the learning curve is steep and its chaotic to track when playing on anything other than a massive tv but with crossplatform support its likely to become a cult mainstay for indie multiplayer aficionados,1
into the dead is a pretty fun wellmade autorun zombie survival game that arrives on switch at a ludicrous price point that makes it very hard to justify picking up the central gameplay loop is satisfying enough for a few minutes but its as deep as youd expect to find in a game that originated as a freetoplay mobile experience its been padded out with a bunch of extra modes and theyre all perfectly serviceable but you can never escape the core truth that its just the same thing over and over again in slightly different settings if youre an absolutely massive fan of running through endless waves of zombies whilst very slowly unlocking weapons to make it seem as though youre somehow changing that experience fill your boots but everyone else should maybe check this out for free on a mobile device first instead,1
at its heart overwatch on the switch was always going to be a bit of a tough sell those who somehow havent played it yet could easily buy a betterperforming version on other platforms while those who have played it to death may be put off by the weaker performance and the lack of shared progression even so having the capability to play a match of overwatch while using the restroom is living at its absolute finest and the kind of flexibility offered up by the switchs portability is not something to be understated wed give overwatch a recommendation but with the caveat that you should consider first why youre buying it if you intend on playing it plenty when undocked we cant recommend it enough but if you intend on mostly playing on the tv consider first buying it elsewhere,1
stranded sails offers some terrific farming simulation which does the majority of the games heavy lifting but its held up by middling rpgesque mechanics mixing things up and throwing a selection of genres into a pot to see what comes out is arguably commendable and theres an awful lot to like about stranded sails but some frustrating and bizarre choices in regards to recipes and the energy meter system hamstring the game for those hoping for a less taxing castaway experience,1
this is another strong showing from beamdog that sees a real odd couple of classics in the best shape theyve maybe ever been coupled with a control system designed for consoles that makes them as effortless to play on the move as they are sat at a keyboard and mouse icewind dale is probably as good as oldschool combat ever got and is still an absolute gem for fans of epic dungeoncrawling who dont mind the brutal difficulty involved in getting the hang of its action planescape torment on the other hand is a narrative masterclass which still feels fresh as a daisy and is as bizarre funny and endlessly replayable as its ever been together these two make for a pretty essential addition to your switchs rpg library,1
the witcher wild hunt remains a masterpiece and being able to take such a grand and engrossing adventure on the go is something well worth celebrating the switchs complete edition is a truly impressive achievement and although performance isnt perfect its still an incredible and impactful roleplaying experience the witcher set the bar for modern rpgs back in and this port is a startling reminder that it has yet to be bettered,2
baldurs gate and baldurs gate enhanced editions arent magical groundup reworkings or spectacular remasters these are games that are showing their age in many ways and theres no doubt that some of the more recent tributes to the glory days of the infinity engine games such as divinity original sin or pillars of eternity are in many ways more readily accessible and appealing to modern audiences however these are still classics of the genre that are absolutely worth persisting with once you get to grips with some of their more antiquated ways youll be handsomely rewarded with some of the deepest combat best writing voiceacting and characters youre likely to find in the genre the switch really is turning into an rpglovers dream machine,1
call of cthulhu manages to deliver a game thats ripe with atmosphere but is built upon triedandtrue tropes of the genre that never really manage to evolve beyond the scope of whats already been seen and heard before paired with some technical hiccups we can say that call of cthulhu is only really for truly dedicated fans of lovecraft everyone else is advised to look elsewhere for their entertainment,1
nearly two years on from its initial release the alliance alive hd remastered proves to be a perfectly competent port of an already fantastic handheld game a wellwritten story a smartly interwoven and complex system of gameplay mechanics and a distinctive visual style makes this a nobrainer for anybody looking for a consistently highquality rpg experience on their switch it may feel a little simple given its origins on the ds but dont make the mistake of passing up on the alliance alive hd remastered its well worth your time,1
overall valfaris is a much better game than its predecessor introducing new systems and ideas to help keep its actionplatformer formula engaging and interesting the handcrafted pixel art style and the brutally joyous soundtrack really elevate the whole experience even if it ends up falling back into some bad habits an unpredictable difficulty curve mixed with an occasionally messy approach to enemy spawning can make some levels a blood pressurespiking experience but when its not trying to undo its own achievements youre left with a linear sidescrolling shooter that delivers a mosh pit of monsters mayhem and metal,1
trine had a lot riding on it given the effects of its predecessor but we can confidently say that the course has been corrected and the series reputation restored from start to finish trine is a remarkably absorbing and beautiful experience thatll keep you challenged and interested right through to the finish while also offering a fair bit to keep you coming back for a couple hours after the credits roll though the combat needs some work any failings here are easily rectified by the strong puzzle design that manages to stay both dynamic and challenging if youre looking for an easily accessible game to play in coop or a game thats a bit more reliant on brains than reflexes trine the nightmare prince is just what youre looking for wed give it a high recommendation especially if you enjoyed some of frozenbytes earlier work,1
enjoyment of ghostbusters the video game remastered depends almost entirely on your affection for the movies we love em but if you dont then knock at least one point off the score below and perhaps take a long hard look in the mirror for the rest of us this is a wonderful form of time travel it has no business calling itself a remaster and is best approached as a straight port of a tenyearold game but its a fine one mechanicallyspeaking theres little you havent seen elsewhere but its a goodlooking fun thirdperson romp dripping in slimy nostalgia and the chance to spend time in the company of these old friends some of them dearly departed is too good to pass up if youve ever strapped on your school backpack and gone out to catch ghosts in the garden,1
when it gets on with the bunlobbing antics of classic burgertime this is a great reminder of an arcade gem but too many coop cooks spoil the broth and the recipe is overstuffed with extras that detract from the core flavour that said any game that lets you leave a trail of murdered pickles as you fight up the online leaderboard cant be all bad just a tad overcooked perhaps,1
dead by daylight has been around for quite while now and has remained a pretty popular game on both pc and console over the years its a straightforward and repetitive online affair that if youre lucky enough to be matched with the right bunch of randoms or happen to be playing a custom match with friends can deliver the goods in terms of frights and tension from time to time however it has also always been a pretty clunky affair a fact which is amplified further here by the noticeable graphical downgrade laggy menus and the exclusion of a bunch of dlc that we really feel should have been included for the steep asking price still if youre a fan who wants a portable version to play on the go this should satisfy your needs as long as youre happy to grind yourself back to where you were at and fork out for your favourite killers for everyone else this is the least impressive version of the game available to buy at its highest price,1
yuno a girl who chants love at the bound of this world was clearly once an incredibly daring visual novel but some of that sense of mystery is done a disservice when revisiting the concept via this remake games like steinsgate or the danganronpa series have since eclipsed it that said theres nothing as expansive or daring as yunos branching timeline system which still comes across as impressive even today despite all of its archaic design elements cringeworthy perverted dialogue and nowbland characters you cant refute the fact that the modern visual novel genre would simply not exist without yuno its just a shame that this remake feels like it has lost some of the soul of its original release with nothing but bland character designs to refresh it for a modern audience,1
donkey kong country fans rejoice this is the spiritual successor youve been waiting for the worst thing you could say about it is that the overworld exploration may prove to be too involved for those who are in it purely for the runnyjumpy stuff but those who are happy to mix platforming with topdown adventuring and dont mind adapting to the constantly changing pace will find the best of both worlds here yookalaylee and the impossible lair is a fantastic sophomore effort that pays tribute to rares past and establishes playtonic as one of the uks most exciting studios,1
while sniper elite v remastered introduced nintendo switch owners to rebellions ww sniper shooting gallery it pales in comparison to the leaps and bounds sniper elite ultimate edition makes in order to progress the series while the stealthy ranged formula is still intact those far more open maps allow for greater player agency and more systemic moments as you unleash hell from up close and afar improved stealth an unoriginal yet satisfying xp system for cheap rewards and some ridiculously fun multiplayer modes make this a real series highlight that runs like a dream on nintys hardware but dumb ai a rather boring storyline and a rather worrying focus on gratuitous gore all conspire to sully the experience somewhat having said that there are few things in modern video gaming that are as perversely satisfying as popping a nazis testicles from halfway across a battlefield so break out your m garand and get reducing the reichs virtual headcount because this game is well worth a look despite its shortcomings,1
fifa is a cynical attempt from a publisher to completely cease support for the switch while still having the gall to suggest it deserves to be rewarded with a nearpremium fee for its lack of effort if you want to pay good money to get insulted go heckle a bigname comedian instead at least youll get a smile out of it if you dont already own a fifa game on switch and arent bothered about having the latest kits and team rosters just get last years version on the cheap,1
dragon quest xi s echoes of an elusive age definitive edition is an achievement that square should be proud of this is one of the best games theyve put out in years a heartwarming wellpaced narrative supported by a cast of fantastic characters a dense and interesting overworld packed with dozens of hours of content and one of the finest soundtracks weve heard in a jrpg combine to make this an unforgettable modern classic whether youre a newcomer to the jrpg genre or a returning vet do yourself a favor and buy dragon quest xi s echoes of an elusive age as soon as youre able this is the epitome of a gift that keeps on giving and it more than deserves a spot in your switch library,2
it feels like its been a long time coming and thankfully any concerns fans may have had ahead of a switch release can be laid to rest by death himself darksiders ii deathinitive edition is a visual feast offering little to those who have already played through elsewhere but holding nothing back for the purists and new players alike ageold camera issues remain but if youve been waiting to get on board with death and his horsemen this latetotheparty package is an easy recommendation,1
the legend of zelda links awakening was a technical marvel when it first arrived on the scene back in easily one of the great game boy releases it was a first bash at a handheld zelda that took the formula as perfected by a link to the past jammed it all onto a tiny portable console and somehow managed to make it all work while adding a host of new features and concepts to the mix this beautiful switch remake rebuilds all of this from the ground up in fine style it adds modern conveniences a dungeon creator amiibo support and lots of little quality of life improvements whilst infusing every single square inch of koholint every secret passage piranha pokey and pig warrior with a level of detail and depth that totally reinvigorates both its timeless story and classic zelda gameplay for a whole new generation of gamers,2
while lego jurassic world does nothing particularly new or exciting to distinguish itself from other platforms other than being portable which it pulled off three years ago on ps vita anyway its impossible to not be swept up by its charming recreation of the jurassic saga with a greater focus on puzzlesolving than combat even the youngest of players will find it a safe and engaging place to muck around with danish bricks much like every other lego release its relevance to you comes down to your connection to the franchise but if you have a penchant for clever girls and staying out of the long grass and you havent played it already this port is bound to sink its claws into you,1
gun gun pixies is a bad game its a terrible thirdperson shooter a clunky platformer and an incompetent visual novel all wrapped up in an embarrassingly puerile attempt at titillation usually this type of game can be saved somewhat by at least having some humour about itself or some level of selfawareness as to how bonkers or puerile its being but gun gun pixies cant even manage that its hard to believe anyone would choose to offend themselves with this kind of thing but if it is your bag you should still be put off somewhat by the fact that everything it attempts to do on a purely technical level it does very badly indeed,1
ni no kuni wrath of the white witch is an experience unlike any other on the switch expertly blending standard rpg tropes with a heartwarming story innovative art style and an immersive soundtrack composed by some of the best in the business in more ways than one this is a dream project thats very existence is a gift to fans of the genre the world over the privilege of experiencing it is something that shouldnt be understated even so it also notably falls short of being an undisputed masterpiece as pacing issues and shoddy ai drag down an otherwise pitch perfect experience those issues aside ni no kuni wrath of the white witch still proves to be lightyears ahead of most other rpgs currently available on the switch if you consider yourself a fan of the genre or even if youre just looking to get your feet wet you owe it to yourself to give ni no kuni wrath of the white witch a shot,2
star wars has finally come to nintendo switch while it might not be in the form that appeals to everyone that doesnt make it any less accessible with short and snappy missions its perfect for bursts of short play on a commute or longer sessions in search of high scores and holocron shards switchexclusive features such as the career mode the updated galactic struggle an unlockable soundtrack and support for vertical play make this a fine addition to the platforms growing pinball library and a silly yet authentic ode to all things star wars,1
ai the somnium files starts out slow but once youve traversed a few of its delightfully surreal somnium dreamscapes and got to an ending or two working your way back through your flowchart and striking out in different directions it becomes an engaging and tense affair fans of the zero escape games will feel right at home here and director kotaro uchikoshis talent for putting the player into increasingly unsettling circumstances ensures everything takes flight in a very satisfying way as you work your way through the many strands of the loopy central mystery towards its various different endings,1
at its core daemon x machina is a solid mech action game that controls well and gives the player a generous helping of customisation options its mission structure can get repetitive and its plot is so difficult to grasp it may as well be soaked in grease but as long as youre willing to put up with these and get through its initially bewildering array of gauges and icons you should have a good time with it,1
on the surface nba ks changes to its own formula might seem less substantial but spend more than a few hours with its laser accurate recreation of modern bball and youll soon realise how refined it has become changes to virtual currency earning and progression take the edge off grinding new additions to the neighborhood and proam help bridge the gap between the two and a few welcome changes to myteam help facilitate move space for natural growth even with the everpresent microtransactions its not faultless but those looking to play the full nba experience on a handheld platform can do so with confidence and visual concepts approach to switch is truly laudable simply put theres no better basketball game out there,1
all in all umihara kawase fresh is presented smartly if quite bizarrely its movement system is fiendish sometimes frustrating sometimes freeflowing unfortunately it asks a lot of the player and manages to hide its best bits the level and boss design are unlikely to inspire anyone especially when already taken to wits end by the stuttering difficulty but thats not enough to undo the games unique charm if youre already an umihara fan then umihara kawase fresh will give you your fix like nothing else for anyone else its harder to love but not impossible,1
itd be easy to look at the bobcats resumé look at this and dismiss it out of hand unfortunately although bubsy paws on fire has the foundation of a decent runner and developer choice provisions knows what its doing in terms of creating levels with an engaging flow less than stellar performance bland and repetitive stages superfluous gameplay additions and long loads combine to drag the experience down its not awful its just nowhere near as good as the runner series and ultimately wed recommend ditching the bobcat and spending time in the company of commander video instead,1
spyro reignited trilogy is a wonderful love letter to a classic series keeping everything that made the original games what they were but slapping on a fresh coat of paint for the hd era there are a few creaking bones showing their age here and there but only due to the developers desire to keep things as accurate as possible the switch version looks absolutely stunning and runs surprisingly well so if youre looking for a classic d platforming experience you should definitely give this a lookin,2
theres no doubt that yugioh legacy of the duelists link evolution has a few problems of its own the delays between actions and the randomness of card deliveries still rankle but that doesnt stop this from being the best version of the game yet hardcore devotees will notice that its card archive is missing a few key special cards but as a virtual representation of the longrunning tcg this is a formidable beast with no microtransactions a constant stream of cards to unlock and a streamlined recreation of all six seasons of the anime this ranks as one of the best ccgs on switch if you can overlook its somewhat irksome issues,1
with its amazing visuals fantastic presentation varied gameplay and deep rewarding combat astral chain could well be platinumgames most accomplished game yet it mixes detective work with exhilarating battle sequences that are inventive challenging and perhaps most importantly breathtakingly cool the complexity of the games myriad systems may prove intimidating for some players but the inclusion of a coop play and the ability to automate many of the mechanics via the unchained mode means that even complete newcomers can still enjoy the ride astral chain isnt just one of the switchs standout hits its one of s best video games,2
sports simulators continue to raise the bar of quality on nintendo switch and snooker keeps that upward curve moving with an officially licensed recreation of all things baizebased with an impressive number of faciallyscanned pros and realworld snooker halls and an incredibly precise simulation of striking the ball and setting up future shots youre treated to one of the best snooker games of the last decade while still very rough around in the edges in terms of animations commentary and accessibility this is a must for snooker devotees who want an officiallylicensed sim on switch,1
theres a clear maturation in the work of tokyo rpg factory from game to game as it sticks closely to its traditional ideals while slowly widening the scope of its ambitions bearing this in mind oninaki is certainly the biggest and most innovative release from the studio yet but we wouldnt exactly call it the best though the premise is certainly interesting we felt let down by the story in this one and the combat is less generally enjoyable than the turnbased affairs that came before that being said we also loved the depth offered by the daemon system both in terms of what it offers in character progression and combat variety and the art style of the dark world is truly something to behold wed give oninaki a recommendation to anybody who loves rpgs although it isnt the best this is another solid showing from tokyo rpg factory,1
sword art online fatal bullet is one of the stronger outings for the series in a video game format however its still bogged down by heavyhanded and often thematically troubling melodrama thats delivered at a glacial pace and prefers to eschew the potentially interesting aspects of the world it depicts in favour of stereotypical male heroics teenage matters of the heart and questionable attitudes to its female characters beyond this and judged solely as a game the combat of gun gale online itself is a rather bland clunky and repetitive experience albeit one with a ton of customisation options and modes of play to engage with fans of sword art online will already know whether theyre into this or not for everyone else its a pretty tough sell that doesnt really manage to do anything it attempts well enough to earn a recommendation,1
you can never really go back the game is still there but the magic of that time mixes the memory up to something more intoxicating than it really was go back to the snes ninja warriors now and its still fun but its stuck in the square box of a screen the animation doesnt stand out like it did and oneplayeronly looks weak alongside the other final fight tribute acts of the day but when you see the ninja saviors its somehow exactly what you remember huge lush backdrops silky animation and tight moblevelling ninja moves its like being a kid again and stands as yet another essential switch release you really should own,1
friday the th the game ultimate slasher edition serves up a bloody feast thats a treat for schlock horror fans who want an authentic jason experience while taking that tricky asymmetrical multiplayer template and making it truly enjoyable with a ton of extra skins weapons signature kills and more this complete edition couldnt be any more stacked with dlc sure its still a little janky but with servers that are seemingly holding and two years of refinements straight out of the box this multiplayer gem still knows how to make an entrance on switch mrs voorhees will be pleased,1
redeemer enhanced edition is something of a misnomer yes its the same twoyearold topdown brawlertwinstick shooter but theres very little thats been enhanced here local coop is technically a new feature for the game but considering its woeful performance on switch thats not much of an addition theres an attempt to divide skills between two different paths but with such a barebones approach to stealth youll often just run in pull limbs off and start dealing death loudly if these issues can be addressed then those looking for mortal kombatlevels of gore will slake their thirst for blood but until then its performance remains as battered as your unfortunate enemies,1
so throw away the dud story the awful presentation and the violenceandshamebased soft porn and havent we got a great little shootemup here the fact is that this mechanically competent shooter in a classic style from a proven team comes with all those crummy decorations attached its up to you if its worth overlooking all the ugliness for the sake of a good game that isnt particularly worldchanging,1
mutant year zero road to eden is one of the best additions to the tactical rpg genre in years a wellwritten and rewarding experience that combines the creative use of stealth found in the legacy of its exhitman developers with a world thats full of interesting characters and ideas almost every game in this genre lives in the shadow of xcom but mutant offers enough new ideas to set itself apart the visual downgrade on the switch version can be a little hard on the eye but considering how this sacrifice has preserved the quality of the game within wed call that a worthy tradeoff,1
raiden v directors cut quietly lands on the switch with little fanfare and yet feels right at home along with all the numerous other bullet hell shmups currently available on the system it pays homage to the classic series while also introducing several welcome new features that manage to outweigh its few unfortunate shortcomings we recommend it for both newcomers to the franchise or the genre itself those looking for a game to experience all the thrills that a bullet hell blaster can offer veteran players need not feel left out either since you can easily customize the difficulty within the games options and getting to fight the last true boss of the game will require a superhuman level of skill a great package for a great price can we have the rest of the raiden series now please,1
wolfenstein youngblood is an odd little thing that evokes the smaller scale approach given to far cry new dawn earlier this year like new dawn youngblood is a spinoff that focuses more on gameplay freedom while losing the focus on story in some ways it takes the series forward in the way it tries new ideas and mechanics such as coop and more openended level designs and we hope a number of these features return for the next full sequel but without the mindbending twists and turns of its narrative youngblood pales in comparison to the new order and the new colossus a fun and enjoyable coop shooter and another porting masterclass but one that both improves and diminishes its own winning formula,1
unless youre a fan of the anime kill la kill if is not the game for you while the story mode is beautifully presented its not as lengthy or engaging as the hourslong experiences offered by other arena fighters while the potential of an arc system works arena fighter sounds promising even if it was only publishing in this case this d fighting game ends up being a bigger disappointment than many of its contemporaries the visuals are pristine the animation is gorgeous but everything else feels barren kill la kill if feels like a budget title too bad it costs,1
there was a lot riding on it but we can confidently say that fire emblem three houses has managed to live up to the hype and will stand as a highlight in the series for years to come the expanded gameplay styles retooled combat lovable characters and indepth character customization hook you fast and are almost guaranteed to keep you engaged for dozens if not hundreds of hours as you come to understand this enormous game in its entirety fans both new and old wont want to miss out on what fire emblem three houses has to offer this sets a new standard for what a strategy rpg can be and most certainly proves itself to be the next musthave release for the nintendo switch,2
marvel ultimate alliance the black order isnt a groundbreaking narrativeheavy reinterpretation of the comic characters you know and love but then again neither were the first two games in that regard its a very faithful sequel that mines the vast roster of characters from the comics while including plenty of nods to the current state of the more modern marvel cinematic universe while it doesnt do anything particularly new or outstanding it embraces the brainless fun of its brawler combat with gusto and its at its absolute best when played with a team of playercontrolled supers,1
while god eater has taken a bit of a knock in the visuals department its a sacrifice thats more than worth it for mostly consistent performance and a steady framerate the inclusion of local coop is a real boon for nintendo switch owners especially as theres no telling how the games online community will fare in the months to come with all the current content updates and patches included at launch youre arguably getting a version as good as if not arguably better than those on pc and ps if youre longing for an alternative to monster hunter and you cant wait for dauntless this is your next port of call,1
attack on titan final battle is a real oddity theres a lot of new content introduced as part of the expansion much of it adding real depth and replay value to an already sizeable package but changing the approach to how you experience season three specifically without the character you created and used through the two previous ones does create a schism between final battle and the rest of attack on titan the introduction of ranged weaponry really opens up your titanbattling options and territory recovery is a welcome new dynasty warriorsstyle mode that embraces the games best mechanics however the pricing model is far too high and only serves to penalise players who already own the base game,1
should you buy terraria on the switch well thats a rather nuanced question on one hand you have a stable version of an enjoyable contentrich sandbox classic that can be played both at home and on the go with that latter option proving to be an intuitive take on the other hand the current lack of local coop is pretty damning for many especially given that this switch version is selling for a notably higher price compared to other modern versions wed ultimately give this one a recommendation as the dozens of hours of content and simple openended nature of terrarias gameplay prove to make a strong case for why this one deserves a spot on your switchs home screen but if coop is an important factor for you wed suggest you either wait this one out or just pick it up for another platform,1
it takes a surprising amount of effort to beat minecraft at its own game but wed argue that dragon quest builders in many ways surpasses its inspiration in fun factor and replayability the melding of jrpg conventions with the openended and creatively focused sentiments of sandbox gameplay proves to go over much smoother than youd expect especially now that square enix seems to know what its doing with this subseries dragon quest builders is a much more confident game than its predecessor boldly expanding on its concepts fixing many of its flaws and providing an overall more robust adventure experience that fans wont want to miss out on charming characters a welltuned gameplay loop and near endless replayability ensure that youll be coming back to this one for quite some time and though the performance issues are disappointing wed still highly recommend you pick up dragon quest builders,2
we spent a long time mulling over why senran kagura peach ball didnt push any of our buttons if you find anime ladies with animal features highly appealing you can probably add a couple of points to the score below ultimately though peach ball serves up a tedious repetitive story with monotonous characters and pinball tables that can be characterised likewise despite a polished art style and a genuinely interesting idea of livening up the arcade game in a way only possible in a video game we found the end result sorely lacking in the pinball department,1
psyvariar delta truly is a comprehensive package that combines all the features from both medium unit and revision giving the player the chance to customize the experience in a way that has never been possible in prior releases add in the graphical upgrade tate support which is perfect for the flip grip by the way an exclusive level a new optional character to use and smooth performance either docked or portable and this becomes a musthave for any switchowning shooter fan however casual players or those who simply arent fans of the genre may find the focus on high scores and short length offputting still its a fine shooter and we can but hope the sega naomipowered psyvariar the will to fabricate will eventually receive a similar deluxe treatment in the future,1
its crazy to think that the original red faction guerrilla came out years ago especially when you consider no one has matched it for sheer destructive agency as an openworld thirdperson shooter red faction guerrilla remarstered doesnt do much to set itself apart from the pack but its unscripted destruction physics help elevate even the most boring of missions into a riot as you smash walls to reach an objective or use a rocket launcher to crumble enemy vehicles with extra dlc bundled in and some decent switch exclusive motion controls red faction guerrilla is another forgotten shooter that deserves a second or third shot at stardom,1
theres no denying that bloodstained ritual of the night is a fantastic metroidvania and arguably in the same class as the likes of symphony of the night and aria of sorrow in that respect its mission accomplished for koji igarashi he has fulfilled the promise he made back in to create a spiritual successor to the castlevania games hes famous for bloodstained packs in hours of engaging gameplay a complex and rewarding combat system loads of collectables and plenty of gothic atmosphere its just a shame that igarashi wasnt able to stage this revival within the castlevania series itself but fans should count themselves lucky there hasnt been a fullblown castlevania entry since s divisive lords of shadow and it would seem that the publisher is content to allow that esteemed series to fester in its grave for the time being retro collections notwithstanding,1
world end syndrome has the branching story paths you would expect of a visual novel but it manages to keep tons of fresh content in store for several times through and makes the process of replaying fast and exciting the core story is also built to offer more and more insight as you run different paths making for a sense of a coherent game and not just a handful of alternative outcomes each asking that you pretend the others never happened it will inevitably have you barrelscraping for story scraps if you have the percent itch but can stave off that kind of rote work for an impressively long run,1
put in as simple a manner as possible this is likely to be the last d mario game youll need its super mario maker but with more of everything that made the original so phenomenal enemies themes game styles gizmos powerups the story mode having an actual story multiplayer the list of additional gubbins is truly massive when you take a step back there are a few small niggles here and there but theyre overwhelmingly dwarfed by the sheer joy and unbridled freedom that exceeds the original in spades realistically this game poses the question as to whether this is the future for d mario as a whole for any fan of mario who owns a switch heck for any switch owner full stop buying this game is an absolute necessity,2
crash team racing nitrofueled is a visually phenomenal upgrade on a playstation karting classic and one that faithfully recreates both its positives its unique drift boosting system and its potential irritants fps tricky ai it does bring a whole new set of issues mainly lengthy loading times and the fact that playing offline stops you making any progress towards unlocking anything but while these prevent the game from becoming an absolute musthave they dont sour the experience enough to stop us wholeheartedly recommending it regardless,1
super neptunia rpg actually has more in common with south park the fractured but whole than it does more traditional rpgs simply because it takes systems that can often be a little too complicated and makes them far more palatable for players hoping for a more casual experience combat can often drift a little too far into the casual zone especially with the ability to speed up battles but the strength of its environmental design and the lighthearted nature of its quests helps this spinoff hold a lot more weight than some of the throwaway cashins that have graced ps vita in recent years,1
when you consider how many titles konami is packing into its anniversary collection packages and that their retail price is almost half what square enix is demanding for the three games included here its impossible to not question the value of collection of mana however theres no denying the fact that secret of mana is one of the finest console rpgs of all time and even though its readily available elsewhere playing it on switch is like wrapping yourself up in a warm and familiar blanket its just right somehow we could argue that secret of mana is merely the appetizer for the real star of this collection trials of mana its nothing short of a masterpiece and finally getting the chance to play it officially in english is a landmark moment for snes and rpg fans alike sure theres the temptation to wait for the upcoming d remake also confirmed for switch but if youre serious about this genre then it shouldnt take our recommendation to convince you to part with your hardearned cash what youve got here are two of the finest examples of the genre accompanied by a third likeable entry which is also well worth a look when you consider the many hours of topnotch entertainment on offer the price is very nearly a steal,1
at the end of the day sword art online hollow realization is the kind of game that you probably already know if youre interested in or not this is an animeinspired indepth rpg that comes with all the trappings good and bad that your mind associates with that description fans of the show and of complicated rpgs will no doubt find plenty to love here in the likable characters complex character customization and frantic battle system while those who would consider themselves to be unfamiliar with rpgs or the anime will no doubt be put off by the uneven sometimes cringeworthy writing lack of effective tutorials and general tedium present throughout the whole experience wed give sword art online hollow realization a recommendation overall this is a good quality rpg just make sure you do a bit of research in advance to confirm that its what youre looking for,1
while ultimately less accessible than the likes of wargroove which taps into that nintendocentric dna of advance wars far better battle worlds kronos does a decent job of bringing a more complex and challenging take on turnbased hex strategy the reinforcements system makes this far less hard than its tutorials would have you believe although its a much purer experience without them the lack of online multiplayer support stings but its balanced out by a hotseat local version its overly long mission structure doesnt lend itself to short bursts of play but for those looking for something suitably meaty in the strategy department will find plenty to enjoy,1
cricket brings the full cricket experience to nintendo switch for the very first time this port can sometimes struggle in the performance a few too many prematch cutscenes likely being one of the main offenders but gameplay is mostly slowdown free letting you focus on juggling a ton of options in every corner of the field the sheer number of modes on offer is astounding and while the lack of consistent official licences is frustrating the potential for communitydriven support in scenarios mode and online proves that the switch continues to be a worthy platform for fullon sports simulators,1
as a specific and finite experience tt isle of man is superbike and supersport racing at its most intense and exhilarating theres few tracks in the world of motorsport that are as challenging and downright frustrating as snaefell mountain and even the most experienced of virtual riders will find their mettle tested however with a meagre career mode few additional tracks and several issues with performance this is a racing highlight surrounded by janky filler,1
kotodama could have been a perfectly fine mystery school adventure if it didnt leave you blindly groping in the dark through repeats of repeats for a tiny morsel of fresh content failing that it could have been a decent brainteaser if only it had the depth of even the most casual of freetoplay phone puzzlers it could even have been an actually erotic visual novel if your leads people ive met but without their clothes on fantasies ever went anywhere real or imagined kotodama is in every way too much of not enough the individual elements do not work well on their own nor gel together to form something new and there is no unique fusion going on here nor even a basic feeling of quality to the individual elements pick whichever part intrigues you most about this title then seek it out elsewhere,1
among the sleep benefits from a fresh setting and the odd spooky setpiece but its let down by disappointingly generic puzzles and stilted gameplay it takes a number of baby steps in the direction of firewatch and gone home but its got a lot of growing up to do before it deserves to be mentioned in the same breath,1
crystal crisis isnt going to dethrone the kings of the falling block genre anytime soon its a solid puzzler with a heart of gold but it doesnt have the decades of improvements that its peers have with a solid amount of content an amazing cast of characters and fantastic presentation though we recommend this as a fun alternative if you tire of tetris,1
little friends dogs cats invites comparisons with the nintendogs series with its structure and overall presentation however once youve enjoyed petting your fill of digital good bois youll be left marvelling at how little there is to do even compared to that most lightweight though fondly remembered of nintendo offerings,1
its a rare game that can start off tense and then continuously ratchets up the mood to almost unbearable levels until the final moments of the final chapter and an even rarer one that has enough alternative characters dialogue and endings to make it worth playing through more than once but death mark succeeds where it really counts theres plenty on offer here for both horror fans as well as those looking for a mystery that requires more than hoarding knickknacks and waiting patiently for your character to officially notice something before you can proceed,1
atelier lulua the scion of arland proves to be a great entry in gusts longrunning series and much like the many concoctions made by lulua this is a refined final product that reflects several of the best traits of the predecessors that came before if you can get past the hohum storytelling and learn to master the intimidating crafting system youll find that atelier lulua the scion of arland has plenty to offer in its surprisingly involved combat system gorgeous locales and rewarding gameplay loops we would give this game a strong recommendation to both longtime fans of the series and to those looking to see what its all about atelier lulua the scion of arland is one of the best entries in the franchise and its a wonderful rpg thats certainly worth your time,1
guilty gear th anniversary edition is a fantastic addition to the switchs roster of fighting games and sits right up there with the very best examples of the genre the platform has to offer mostly due to the fact that xx accent core plus r is just about the strongest most technically refined entry in the series the original game is showing its age but its still an absolute blast and together these two games provide fight fans with a neat look at how the d era of guilty gear developed from inception to its most polished and refined point its a disappointment that the online mode in xx accent core plus r isnt performing as it should be right now as theres no escaping the fact that online is a major aspect of this type of game it definitely sullies what is otherwise an absolutely essential purchase but theres still more than enough singleplayer content here to make this collection highly recommended,1
the first resident evil remains a classic of the genre in many ways it is and can only ever be a product of its time though even when tuned and honed and buffed to perfection it has its own idiosyncratic personality and ways change them and you change the game series veterans will know what to expect but new players should prepare themselves for a schooling in game mechanics which have largely fallen out of fashion the same applies to resident evil and while the original game is the obvious draw here the prequel deserves another look especially for fans who skipped it both games look great on switch and the ability to play onthego helps alleviate some of the frustrations inherent to their oldfashioned systems giving them the best possible opportunity to win you over in a modern context capcoms shady cartbased practices aside theres ultimately no better way to sample that original survival horror formula in provided youve got the stomach and the space on your system memory for it,1
its a pretty good game but theres a lingering sense that redout couldve been so much more if it were buffed up in a few key areas the lacklustre online complete omission of local multiplayer and the overall shoddy performance hold this one back from being something great and its a real shame even so the stellar art style catchy soundtrack and indepth career mode ensure that its a satisfying experience for those who can put up with the difficulty redout is certainly worth your time but only if you would consider yourself a fan of this rather niche subgenre if that isnt you it may still be worth a punt but wed recommend trying out fast rmx over this one,1
taken on its own merits team sonic racing is a fun karting game that doesnt quite match mario kart deluxe in terms of either performance or sheer level of content but still offers satisfying handling and should still keep sonic fans entertained for a while its impossible not to compare it to its predecessor though and in all the areas where sonic allstars racing transformed excelled team sonic racing is merely competent by no means a bad game then but when we look back years from now it wont be standing on any karting game podiums,1
assassins creed iii on switch is easily the weakest remastered version of the game thats been released thus far the expected graphical bells and whistles are mostly absent and this game feels more like a straight port of the original framerate issues plague many of the busier areas of the open world and make combat and traversal a chore for the most part while audio problems are also a constant niggle granted this is still the fullfat game and the fact that its available to play onthego and includes all the dlc and a pretty nice hd version of liberation is impressive but theres no escaping the fact that its a lacklustre port of one of the weakest assassins creed titles,1
nippon ichi software has hit a great formula that avoids the worst excesses of repetition or frustration an addictive mix of d exploration and combat lapis x labyrinth is a cavalcade of colour and complex systems that doesnt outstay its welcome through a sizeable hour campaign,1
turnbased rpgs of yesteryear and today owe a lot of their finetuned tactics to the legacy of tabletop board games and for the king pays tribute to this legacy with a digital adventure where anything can happen the fastpaced nature of its exploration and combat keeps everything feeling fresh and lively but the considerable reliance on chance does take the shine of its otherwise competent combat however with adjustable difficulties which amend the severity of each death and a sizeable amount of expansive dlc this is one roguelike rpg that really shines in coop,1
deponia is a fine example of the genre but theres no getting around the fact that the games price on switch will be your main barrier to entry here it plays well and has that charm that daedalic is famous for and it constantly reminds you of the monkey island series no bad thing at all but when youre able to find the same game for under a quid if you look hard enough and you take into account that this switch version has no added benefits it becomes harder to recommend youd be better of waiting for a price drop or if youre still interested investigate if deponia is available on an alternative platform at a cheaper price,1
silence is a game that deserves to be played in docked mode on the switch it gives you a story youll be immersed in while the vibrant graphics will keep you playing for just that little bit longer you may feel like youre wasting time when it comes to the multiple chat options as they always conclude at the right outcome but your curiosity will want you to keep going to find out more about the world of silence and to bring noah and renie home whatever it takes the lack of touch screen control is a disappointment though and we cant help but feel this should have been priced a little cheaper considering its age and how much it costs elsewhere,1
this is one of those rare games thats appealing to fans of every part of the package and at every level tactical rpg genre fans can have a great time whether theyre just here to pass a few hours with some well presented action or wish to turn up the difficulty and fuss over every stat and build mecha fans ranging from i think i remember liking the red one in evangelion to i built an mg gunpla once and only cried a little when i messed up the decals and even the heady highs of my first mazinger viewing was a betamax fansub at anime club are equally wellserved the game boasts a lengthy and engaging campaign with branching paths that make it worth playing through more than once and the clear divide into distinct chapters makes it easy to tackle in manageable chunks without having to swear to devote all of your attention to it to the exclusion of all else the fact that it has an englishlanguage option out of the box is the icing on the cake import this one as soon as possible if you like what you see here,1
as was the case with rogue trooper redux and battlezone gold edition previously rebellion has done justice to one of its most enduring franchises here while sniper elite v remastered isnt the series high point it does offer a fine opportunity to sample its most enjoyable features including scouting entire locations and taking incredible shots at even more incredible distances on a brand new platform however while its longrange action is as gripping as ever the more traditional runandgun sections stick out like a sore thumb and the absense of autosaving can lead to some frustrating moments while it still very much looks and plays like a game from the previous hardware generation the fact that every element from the original release including coop and the entire suite of multiplayer modes has made the cut makes this is an agreeable if imperfect way to practice your aim before the far superior sniper elite iii ultimate edition drops later this year,1
while no one expected it and we dare say that no one asked for it saints row the third the full package revives an often forgotten openworld adventure on a new console generation complete with a huge amount of cosmetic and expansion dlc while its showing its age mechanically and in terms of taste in visual terms its a robust sandbox filled with outlandish activities hyperactive ideas and the kind of diverse mission design most openworld titles fail to fully realise with support for both local and online coop this version of saints rows best outing is a steal we might not ever get a grand theft auto on switch but this is probably the next best thing,1
final fantasy xii the zodiac age is a great example of what developers should aspire to do with remastering old games this is the bestdesigned and most enjoyable version of this rpg classic currently on the market and it can all be played on the go too though the story comes off as being rather disappointing and the visuals are a little dated the gambitfocused combat system still proves to be one of the best weve seen in an rpg to date making it dangerously easy for hours to slip by as you work on minmaxing characters to the best of their abilities final fantasy xii the zodiac age may not prove to be the best final fantasy ever made but its still a pretty darned great game in its own right dont miss out on this one its certainly worth your time,2
labo vr kit is a giant joyous mess of imagination creativity and potential from a valueformoney perspective the starter set is an easy recommendation and even hardened labo cynics will likely enjoy the blaster and trying out the mario and zelda vr updates although those updates arent enough on their own to warrant a purchase the starter kit offers a great taste of the labo construction experience and access to most of the pickupandplay vr plaza novelties if the bug really takes you of course its easy enough to get the expansion sets,1
mortal kombat is the best mortal kombat since mk a bold and bombastic entry that boasts a fighting model that finally matches the slapstick theatrics of gory fatalities its further proof that mk much like street fighter has just as much relevance today as it did in the s thanks to the way its evolved while retaining its core identity on switch its a performancefirst experience that nails fps and boasts every mode and mechanic from other versions only with a noticeable downgrade in the aesthetics department the heavyhanded application of microtransactions makes customisation far less appealing than it should but if netherrealm can redress the balance mk could be a contender for the best fighter on nintendo switch,1
there are some that will argue dragons dogma was hardly a perfect game when it was first released and the passage of time will have done little to pacify those very same naysayers the world of gransys may lack the epic intricate lore of lordran drangleic and lothric but it more than makes up for this shortcoming in sheer scope exploring the landscape is addictive in itself and theres always some new nook or cranny to investigate even when youre many many hours in add in some of the most enjoyable realtime combat ever seen in an rpg and it becomes easier to appreciate just why this game has become so beloved over the past few years even though capcom has done little to spruce it up theres no denying that it is rough in parts and really could have done with a full remaster rather than a straight rerelease but dragons dogma nonetheless remains a fantastically gripping roleplaying experience that manages to straddle the divide between exhilarating realtime action and statbased adventuring,2
final fantasy x was a watershed moment for the storied franchise rightfully gaining widespread acclaim while also ushering the series into the new generation and while final fantasy x hasnt quite reached the same level of influence it stands as a fantastic adventure in its own right with a level of quality that surpasses most of the competition in the switch library having both of these incredible games in one package with all the international content thrown in and with prettied up graphics and audio makes picking up this release a nobrainer final fantasy x x hd remaster successfully does justice to these two rpg classics as it brings them to a new age of players we cant recommend it highly enough,2
super dragon ball heroes world mission is the best version of the longrunning cardbattling series yet boasting a raft of new adjustments extra cards and fresh missions to keep you coming back for more its packed to the rafters with content from a heavyduty story mode to local and online battles so if youre a fan of the series youre going to lap up this entry now its finally arrived in the west while it lacks the deeper tactical nuance of warhammer age of sigmar champions its still a fun and unapologetically japanese arcade experience right there on your switch,1
my time at portia is an ambitious game that actually delivers on what it sets out to do the crafting can be extremely overwhelming at first and the presence of some ingame timers can be a mild annoyance but get your head round its detailed multistep building missions and youll end up with a game that could end up racking hundreds of hours on your switch,1
darksiders warmastered edition is a faithful port of the original that brings every slash of chaoseaster and every bloody execution to nintendo switch in all its glory while still the inferior entry in the darksiders trilogy this first outing is still a robust actionplatformer full of satisfying melee combos openended levels and a suitably overthetop story easily one of the most underrated franchises to appear in the previous generation darksiders is a solid port that finally unleashes the apocalypse in handheld form,1
its not often we recommend you play a nintendo switch game on a different platform but theres simply no way we could advise you to pick this up right now in its current state theres every chance the developer could provide substantial support to patch xenon racer into a more playable state but as of writing its a game that doesnt warrant that full price tag with a layer of extra blurring when playing in handheld mode and that sense of breakneck speed reduced substantially by the sheer drop in frames when racing youre forced to endure a racer that simply cant justify its own existence on switch add in poor controls and input lag and its clear that xenon racer needed a little more time in the garage,1
if youre new to the series yoshis crafted world has colour and charm to spare even if its inventiveness is largely limited to its looks for yoshi fans it does exactly what you expect it to which is perhaps the worst thing we can say about it it contains few genuine surprises its delightfully presented though and makes for another very solid entry in nintendos evergrowing pantheon of materialbased platformers it takes extreme discipline to not overuse that word charm while discussing it so if youre looking to share a lighthearted platformer with the family or simply relax in a big chair with a cup of something warm and a comfy pair of socks be sure to have a spare pair ready yoshis crafted world will charm the ones youre wearing right off,1
unravel two was already a wonderful little game filled with heartfelt moments of poignant storytelling and challenging platforming puzzles and now it has a fitting new home on nintendo switch even with a few downgrades to the visuals unravel two is far from an inferior experience when played on nintendos hybrid system full of charm and character its one of the best cooperative platformers you can play anywhere and another robust switch port that was well worth the wait,1
while there are improvements across the board rbi still falls short of being a musthave baseball outing its fun without being deep and the lack of online play will be unforgivable to many players it also struggles technically which is a shame given that its hardly the most visually stunning switch title still if you like the sport then go ahead buy it and enjoy a game of baseball slap a few whoppers dominate a home run derby have some fun just dont expect that fun to last youll get fed up quickly and become envious of those dastardly ps owners,1
the nature of the genre makes it pretty tough to do a musou game wrong but its also rather difficult to do one thats truly right providing an experience thats capable of rising above the repetition and relatively easy difficulty fateextella link manages to do just that including all of the trappings of a musou outing while sprinkling in a handful of fun engaging or creative changes to the overarching design and style to escalate this release a bit above the competition and certainly above its predecessor if youve never much been a fan of mindless hack n slash games wed say this is a great way to test whether this genre is for you and if you consider yourself to be a musou nut this is one of the best distillations of the concept weve yet seen either way fateextella link is well worth your time wed recommend you add it to your switch collection at some point,1
rico is simple moreish fun in arcade fps form a literal corridor shooter that makes every gunfight a glorious exchange of bullets as you fight your way to the words room cleared over and over again its great fun in singleplayer but when you head into each randomised set of rooms in coop youll shoot your way into an interactive buddy cop movie right there in the palm of your hands loading times and the occasional bit of popin aside this is another fine addition to the consoles growing list of firstperson shooters,1
the lego movie videogame isnt the groundbreaking reinvention the franchise so desperately needs but its still a step in the right direction its still got the same onenote combat even with some master builder special attacks thrown in for good measure and missions too often boil down to go find enough resources to build this item which opens this door etc but for all the times it falls into the pitfalls of its own past theres plenty to appreciate the focus on collecting resources makes total sense for a game all about breaking everything in sight and the mixture of sandbox levels and creative building options is a timely reminder that lego worlds has plenty of ideas still worth revisiting,1
rad rodgers radical edition serves up a hefty slice of sidescrolling shooter action and metroidvaniaesque exploration while the optimisation for nintendo switch has dulled its colourful looks its still an attractive looking little adventure that happily dances between a pixaresque art style and some classic bit pixelation the option to play in a kidfriendly mode does make this a little more palatable for younger players but any game with duke nukems involvement is always going to be aimed at the conkers bad fur day crowd ultimately its a fun but forgettable experience that will appeal to fans of the genre but wont leave a lasting impression,1
fimbul creates an appealingly grim norse folkloreinfused world to adventure through but its core action is simply too weak to seal the deal its pacy combat can be brutally satisfying but its also shallow and repetitive while the game struggles from a technical perspective theres a promising world at the heart of fimbul but it needs to be married to a more fluid and fleshedout game,1
remilore is the sort of game thats meant to soothe and delight while offering occasional moments of legitimate excitement and it achieves this goal to a wonderful degree with that being said theres also very little here that you havent seen before the hack n slash action roguelite elements and rpg mechanics rarely stray beyond welltrodden tropes making for a very safe gameplay experience if youre looking to buy a game that has a decent amount of depth and doesnt require much from the player in terms of skill or time remilore is a fantastic recommendation on the other hand if youre looking for a game to replace your diablo addiction youll likely be disappointed by whats on offer either way remilore proves itself to be a wellmade and inoffensive loot grind of an rpg consider giving this one a look,1
trials rising is the mostly full package youve been waiting for with its huge list of tracks to tackle and all the races and trickbased stunts you could ask for redlynx has served up the best instalment in the series since trials evolution with a killer soundtrack tons of customisation and an impressively deep tutorial mode its only really let down by a tutorialfree track editor the drop to fps might put off those also playing on other platforms and the drop in visual fidelity can be hard to miss at times but despite its blemishes trials has proved its right at home on nintendo switch,1
blazblue centralfiction special edition may a few years late to nintendo switch but that time hasnt dulled the sharpness of its d fighting package not only does it give the ragna saga a proper sendoff with a story mode thats so rich in character development it could be a full anime season in its own right but it offers a staggering number of modes to keep you playing long after the credits roll it runs silkysmooth docked or in handheld modes and runs like a dream online the lack of an english dub still rankles and new adopters are going to have to do a lot of research to understand whats going on but its well worth the effort,1
it takes a while to get going and it has its fair share of annoying quirks but as it progresses aragami becomes a solid stealth game with a compelling story the addition of extra dlc chapters gives the game a welcome boost in longevity and though its temperamental mechanics prevent it becoming an unarguable gem its stylish look and the range of abilities you acquire by the end mean fans of stealth games and fans of stealth only will still have a fun time with it eventually,1
monster energy supercross the official videogame is a vast improvement in many ways upon the first game the inclusion of a track editor the reinstatement of online multiplayer and the sheer level of authenticity on offer will impress both longtime supercross fans and casuals looking to spray mud on two wheels visually its a noticeable step up and while it does occasionally chug the frame rate holds fast most of the time its just a shame those monstrously long loading times and a needlessly grindy unlock system takes away some of its shine,1
despite being a licensed tiein dragons dawn of new riders is anything but a broken halfbaked moneygrab its not particularly remarkable in its features and it really misses a trick by not adding more things to do while riding your dragon between dungeons but for recovering skylanders fans and those a little too young to go loot crazy in diablo this is still a familyfriendly adventure thats well worth your time on nintendo switch,1
given the high standard of gameplay that inti creates has shown in many other titles its released over the last several years its hard not to be disappointed by dragon marked for death although the art direction is a definite plus this is merely an inoffensive and unimaginative coop sidescrolling rpg at best but looking at the bigger picture particularly the archaic design elements and baffling exclusion of splitscreen play makes this a release thats admittedly hard to recommend to anyone thats not a diehard fan of the company if you liked the mega man zero series this is a passable attempt at recreating that series gameplay style and it might resonate with some of you but wed otherwise recommend you take a pass on this one,1
while its platforming mechanics are still a tad unpredictable at times and the huge gaps between save points still rankle sphinx and the cursed mummys quality nonetheless shines through weaving melee combat environmental puzzles and plenty of platforms with a fun and interesting take on egyptian mythology its an actionplatformer that really holds up well despite the years on its clock its camera might still be a bit rubbish but with a new lick of hd paint this is a hidden gem that deserves a little time in the limelight,1
billed as a side dish travis strikes again no more heroes has been prepared with enough love and affection to become a filling meal on its own packed with the spice and spirit youd expect from travis touchdown its a fun indieinflected blast of hackandslash which doesnt change the world mechanically and dont go in expecting no more heroes but its sincerity and energy are charming its an adult game a gamers game foulmouthed and dripping with style if youre sitting on the fence wed recommend diving in if only to support its infectious celebratory spirit suda seems to have a real affection for nintendo hardware and this makes you feel lucky to have him working on switch,1
while tales of vesperia definitive edition doesnt make an major changes to the original game that launched over a decade ago it does combine practically every piece of exclusive content into one wholesome package with the benefit of some improved visuals in both cutscenes and gameplay its very difficult to recommend this jrpg classic on any other system than nintendo switch thanks to how well it performs in both docked and handheld modes if youve ever slept on this classic theres never been a better way to rectify that error,1
new super mario bros u deluxe is an impressive package if you skipped the original offering the best of modernera d mario madcap multiplayer and glimpses of the outrageous invention that was to come in super mario odyssey only the most fervent fans will find enough new content here to justify doubledipping though especially if you already played the luigi expansion the chance to replay a topdrawer mario game on a handheld may be enough for some goodness knows weve rebought super mario bros enough times but this is the oldest of the wii u games to have found new life on switch and gameplay aside ageing visuals and the colossal irritation of being kicked back to the world map after every death stand out as things in need of attention the bottom line is that switch now has a very fine d mario to its name we just cant help feeling disappointed that nintendo didnt push the boat out with a more thorough deluxe refurbishment having said that this is still an excellent package that deserves a new lease of life on switch especially as there will be many owners of that console who didnt get to experience the wii u original and its expansion,1
within its commonsense and thanks to wii fit wellknown limitations fitness boxing is a breezy energetic success that gets your blood pumping for the onetime price of a months gym membership it delivers some light cv and takes pointers from just dance and various rhythm games to provide a convenient and engaging workout its no substitute for hard hours at the gym but theres certainly potential to tone up those arms and shed a few of the mince pies you put away while watching groundhog day over the holidays it would be a mistake to buy this thinking youre getting a game or some magical antidote to your spare tyre however it kept us coming back and if youre after a reason to justify cancelling that direct debit to golds this is as good as anything youll find on a console,1
vrally is an oldschool rally game at heart for better and worse but mainly the latter if you stick with it youll eventually start to master and enjoy it but the slippery handling and unforgiving no mistakes allowed rally races make getting to that point a real slog on top of this its numerous performance issues are so severe that they arent just ugly theyre downright distracting the result being that although this is now the best rally game on switch by default pretty much every aspect of it leaves acres of room for improvement,1
quantity over quality has never been exhibited so perfectly as it is here having games is undoubtedly impressive but when the vast majority of them are barely decipherable let alone playable youre probably only really left with around titles that will hold your attention for more than a minute while the contribution these games made to the evolution of gaming in its early days cant be denied many of them are stepping stones that we dont need to walk over again had there been some sort of museum mode that helped give more context to each titles place in the history of gaming that wouldve been much better but as it is youre left with a huge stack of games of which around percent just wont hold your attention no matter how much of a retro fan you are,1
rather than building on the solid foundations its predecessor set last year gearclub unlimited slams into reverse gear and delivers racing gameplay that feels significantly more laggy and sluggish than the original with no attempt made to cut its remaining mobile roots and more performance issues than a drunken west end actor we just cant recommend dropping a whopping on this unoptimised clunky effort,1
rollercoaster tycoon adventures is both incredibly enjoyable and considerably infuriating theres just enough of that classic magic in there to make the design and management of a theme park a consistently rewarding experience and using permits and research to space out your access to the good stuff makes this a genuinely fun time sink however the level of automation thats migrated over from the mobile iteration really does negatively impact this switch port and issues with overall performance place a big caveat around its neck while its not a total disaster rollercoaster tycoon adventures does leave you wanting a little more especially if youre a seasoned fan of the longrunning series,1
this war of mine remains an affecting survival experience on switch and this edition is a comprehensive package a couple of minor technical issues do little to diminish its power and although the lack of touch controls is odd sleep mode is a winner for squeezing in a few days asandwhen you can switch arguably helps make this downbeat game as accessible as possible though theres little point in doubledipping if youve tried it elsewhere it deserves to be played in whatever form you can find it though and is therefore a very welcome addition to switchs diverse catalogue,1
so how does it all stack up vocal concerns about past games have been actively addressed every single fighter from the series is present even pichu the customisability is overwhelmingly vast and its all topped off with supersolid singleplayer modes to boot were not sure how you could make a more robust or pleasing smash game super smash bros ultimate truly is the ultimate instalment in the series and it makes you wonder where sakurai can possibly take this franchise next,2
ark survival evolved in its current state is not the best port to grace nintendo switch it is however a proper mmorpg survival game with a deep and rewarding crafting system and the potential for some brilliant online cooperation with your fellow survivors theres a palpable thrill to moving from simple stone tools to more advanced weaponry as you begin to master the crafting cycle an experience no other game on switch can offer right now but its myriad technical problems ranging from texture popin to substantial performance slowdown mean you really are better off playing ark on a different platform for the time being patches could solve some of these problems over time but we cant help but feel this ambitious title will never run at an acceptable level on nintendos hybrid platform,1
monster boy is a tremendous accomplishment its a gorgeous looking game with a fantastic soundtrack and does its spiritual predecessors proud by nailing the wonder boy mechanics while still offering something that will appeal to modern audiences as long as you can appreciate that its still very much an oldschool game at heart and youre going to get some bit era platforming trickiness as a result youre going to thoroughly enjoy playing through this adventure for the hours itll take you to beat it it may not be wonder boy by name but its definitely wonderful by nature,2
toki is an absolutely beautiful remaster with fantastic handdrawn backgrounds brilliant character animation and impressive boss designs aesthetics only go so far though and while the game itself is fun to play if a little cheap with its deaths at times the reality is its an arcade game at heart as such its six stages wont last you too long especially if youre the target audience someone who remembers toki back in the day and has continued to play platformers for the three decades that followed and once its done theres no real replay value,1
with farming simulator having noshowed switch in it falls to spintires mudrunner american wilds to fill that very niche gap while its still got some frustrating design faults that have carried over from the previous version saber interactive has kept the core experience intact the addition of the lush and verdant american wildness helps break up the dreary back roads of russia and whether youre delivering logs on your own or fixing and refilling trucks in multiplayer theres a bizarre yet moreish satisfaction to be had now when are we getting euro truck simulator on switch,1
bendy and the ink machine has plenty going for it as a new horror instalment on nintendo switch such as the way it builds a growing sense of dread and despair throughout its five chapters while using an animation style thats meant to evoke the safety and joy of childhood memories but its let down by some irritating design decisions and frustrating performance issues still if you really do love your horror and want something that ticks all the boxes of a modern scarefest bendy and the ink machine is still a worthy descent into madness,1
segas had more than one stab at creating a comprehensive collection of its best mega drive titles and as a result sega mega drive classics does lose some of its impact due to sheer familiarity for example we already have an immaculatelyported version of sonic on the switch eshop right now even so its hard to argue with the odd games that ship with this new compendium and only a fool would contest the fact that it showcases some of the best games of the bit era the modernday enhancements are welcome too and while this isnt the first time many of these games have gone portable sega mega drive collection on the sony psp did that over a decade ago and lets not forget the amazing sega d classics range on ds which overlaps with some entries in this selection its a real boon to be able to play the likes of phantasy star iv or story of thor on the bus when you take into account how much quality there is on offer here sega mega drive classics becomes an easy recommendation,1
if you think civilization peaked at iv the sixth entry wont change your mind but we envy anyone whos never played the series civilization vi on switch is a brilliant introduction watching and influencing how the world unfolds is as addictive as ever and the boon of portability make this a great way to play lack of online play is an obvious disappointment but the core game works fantastically well on the handheld and we had an absolute blast take our advice and get stuck in also give phillip ii a wide berth true to his word hell get your wealth one way or another,2
pokémon lets go pikachu and lets go eevee are beautiful reimaginings of a video game classic updating a yearold game in ways which make it infinitely more accessible and userfriendly for a modern audience while keeping the magic first discovered all those years ago on the downside the newlyintroduced motion control mechanic is fun but flawed forcing us to shift from one play style to another to get the best experience and while efforts have been made to bring the game up to the standard of more recent entries when it comes to depth and complexity hardcore fans may consider the whole experience too much of a cakewalk still the game does a superb job of striking a balance between being an easy route of entry for newcomers to the series and offering just enough postgame challenge and competitive play elements and nostalgia of course to please series veterans as a result these new titles really do offer something for everyone which cant always be said of the mainline pokémon entries they might not be an absolute masterpiece but wed urge any pokéfans out there to give these ones a go if a lets go johto sequel is on the cards well happily be there waiting in line,1
if youre looking for a game to get the whole family gathered around the tv or your nintendo switch in tabletop mode during the school holidays or at a party carnival games offers plenty of silly minigames to get everyone swinging their joycon its nothing remarkable but the new games do offer a little more variety than the previous versions so if youre looking for a quick pickupandplay alternative to super mario party this colourful collection could be the virtual funfair trip for you,1
