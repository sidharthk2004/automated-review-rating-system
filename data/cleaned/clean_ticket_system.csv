freshdeskfrom our users is crucial as a consumer app with freshdesk our customers can quickly and easily send us comments or concerns and my staff can quickly and simply respond and stay in touch with the customer each feedback ticket may then be monitored to ensure it was addressed and resolved in a timely manner,5
our team were able to automate and monitor a number of our process workflows thanks to freshdesks help in addition it is a better choice than emailing support questions and concerns freshdesk allows our clients to see their ticket status and ticket history as well as submit their comments and rating which simplifies the process of providing excellent customer service,4
my overall experience moving our helpdesk operations to freshdesk was extremely positive and simple to implementwe started out with the free trial and quickly decided to purchase the pro versionour productivity with ticket management increased beyond what my expectations were and the fact that we could keep the tickets forwarded the same way through an existing email address made the transition process transparent to the rest of the community,5
mediocre at best it does what every other support desk system does assign distribute tickets some automation etc etc ive submitted the above feature request for very basic date based filter displays that any email system should have and what is supposed to be an advanced business management tool completely lacks this,3

i started as a free user and found it extremely versatilemy first hiccup was that as a free user when the advanced features that were included expired they disabled my accountinstead of scaling it back it just went offline without warningonce that was fixed we found an excellent way to continue with the free account until they implemented a spam update that invalidated all tickets sent to any email address except our main addressagain this was done without warning and we were offline for dayswe have subscribed but it was done more out of necessity rather than being able to upgrade for full features,5

di recente ho iniziato a utilizzare freshdesk come software per il servizio clienti per la mia piccola impresa prima di freshdesk utilizzavo una combinazione di email e un sistema di helpdesk di base ma man mano che la mia attività cresceva avevo bisogno di una soluzione più solida allinizio ero intimidito dallenorme numero di funzionalità e opzioni di freshdesk ma dopo aver passato un po di tempo a esplorare la piattaforma mi sono subito reso conto di quanto fosse facile da usare linterfaccia era pulita e intuitiva e sono stato in grado di personalizzare facilmente la piattaforma per adattarla alle esigenze specifiche della mia attivitàfreshdesk mi ha permesso di impostare lassegnazione automatica dei biglietti e le notifiche email il che mi ha permesso di risparmiare una notevole quantità di tempo e di rispondere più rapidamente alle richieste dei clienti inoltre lapp mobile mi ha permesso di gestire facilmente i miei ticket di assistenza mentre ero in movimento ho anche apprezzato i report dettagliati e le analisi in freshdesk questi strumenti mi hanno aiutato a tenere traccia delle mie prestazioni e a prendere decisioni basate sui dati per migliorare il mio servizio clienti,5
overall our experience with freshdesk has been extremely positive we have been able to quickly and efficiently manage customer service requests the customer service team has been extremely helpful in resolving any issues we have had the only downside is the higher price of the premium plans,5
it is very efficient simple and collaborative its difficult to overlook a ticket because notifications are everywhere and you can also add reminders under todo for a specific ticket it is cloudbased so our team can work from anywhere,4
overall the experience was below what i expected we were sold the world for this product on how it would transform our customer service and experience instead the product resulted in more problems than what should occur i should have seen the signs when we signed up and had to debate with multiple departments on getting the search bar to work and tags from day one the support lacks and the team despite our feedback is reluctant to budge on a refund overall we have the left the solution because it saves us time and money by going back to basics i would only recommend this product to a medium to larger sized business not for smaller teams as it is not worth the time when compared to other tools,2
it is a very good applicationyou manage your work and get thingsdonei love it,5
freshdesk is a highly useful help desk or customer complaintmanagement platform its social media integration is perfect with support for facebook pages which helped me have a sync with my daily facebook complaints,4
we can manage support requests much better with freshdesk and it has helped reduce response times and support quality as a result of thatnevertheless their support and the lack of a single widget for freshchat and freshdesk is not great,3
it was a good choice and i recommend freshdesk if anyone is looking for omnichannel solution with affordable price plans,5
the freshworks team provides a great onboarding experience as well as continued support across all of their applications they take my feature request submissions very seriously and are always able to respond to my questions quickly and efficiently,5
if i could go back in time with the information i have now i would select zendesk that is software written by and for adultsi would also say the support provided by freshdesk is eager and wellmeaning however the quality has been very poor the support team will generally ignore obvious bugs in the software and waste time with a series of questions core bugs go months and months without correction escalations to management are ignored the csm team makes big promises and then vanishes for weeks or months at a time without so much as email response generally it is a very poor showing,2
we used it for daily customer service contact and it was great it was great for assigning,5
personally this was the best platform that ever happened to our team we reviewed some payfor feature models as well as the free bug tracker in spiceworks which had a ton of adware and freshdesk was the simplest to use and track our bugs even with the nonability to drill down further with the tier we were using for our staff the only other thing i would mention is that it is not hipaa compliant so you want to make sure anything users are posting in there is not anything related to proprietary software otherwise it worked like a charm for our team and our users seemed to like it you do need to make sure that your teams using it have their emails alerting them otherwise a ticket can just sit there i found that i was reminding folks to check the freshdeskfrom an it standpoint we were in there every day fielding tickets and this really helped us to schedule out our dayweek and prioritize,4
first of all they preach by example because freshdesks support is top notch i found myself inspired every time i deal with them and even though i have too many years experience in the support business i have learned from my interaction with freshdesks agents it is clear to me that support is very important to this vendor and they obviously select and train their agents very well integrating the product in our environment was very easy and managing it is simple or as complex as you want it to be i have been using freshdesk for over years now and they still surprise me with new features and new learning material lots of how to videos training and webinars,5
while freshdesk has a great ui and is a featurerich service the truth behind the advertising leaves much to be desired while their software is good the pricing model isnt and their marketing is intentional baitandswitch the features listed on each pricing tier are expanded upon here freshdeskcomfeatures once you buy and ask whats up the support will tell you to upgrade for that feature and link you to a page that isnt linked to from anywhere on their site freshdeskcomhelpdeskfeatures as justificationas an example agentmonth includes sla management which is described from their features page as including every sla feature including basic things like sla email notifications reminders escalation policies you know what anyone would think of as sla management however none of those features are actually included in that price plan to even get email notifications of sla violations or have your sla respect office hours youll have to pay agentmonth worse there is no way to discover this until after youve paid and spent time getting everything set up,4
youd think that m of total investments gets you an insanely good piece of software it does notfreshdesk was a huge step up from the tool we used previously and has some nice features its disappointing that some of the features are lackluster implemented or missing altogether or require you to purchase a higher tier license just to maybe get one more feature out of a whole bundle you wont needthats not a standalone issue in this industry but its extra disappointing if you come across a promising tool that just cant go that extra mile,4
freshdesk is a good producttheir technical support is sporadicsometimes goodsometimes bad unfortunately it is on the downturn again when i first started i had to wait days for a support question to be answered and to contact a salesperson was almost impossibletheir phone support is unusableit rings forever and when you do get through since it is impossible to get throughthough you cannot hear themthe times i have gotten through and left a message noone has replied to my questionwhen your a single person business this is frustratingthe support became better and now it is going back downhill againi feel i have to convince them that something is wrongwhat is most bothersome is they dont understand as a single person business i cannot spend days on a problem and if i tell them there is an issue such as an attack on an email address which i have no control over and they dont fix it,4
their support is probably the best support out there a real star experience plus they are continuously implementing new features and create new productsas an administrator in my company i really dont have to do a lot and i can easily do my job there is almost no complaints from users,5
our business needs quickly expanded into handling over tickets work orders a day across multiple client sites we were struggling to find a suitable solution that would cater for multi site multi users without incurring addition costs for client access to their tickets freshdesk software ticked all the boxes when it came to the online portal access for clients and exporting ticket information into csv files,5
we decided to try this out as our ticketing solution and were very impressed packed with features even at the lower tiers at the lowest priced tier were able to integrate microsoft teams and vstsazure devops which is huge for us the features are also very organized so the admin page doesnt have options to skim through,5
we needed to migrate from a support solution that was bought out by microsoftmicrosoft crm dynamics was too expensive so we reviewed over a dozen solution providersthe freshworks team worked with us to ensure we had a successful implementation months part timethey were also very receptive to our feedback and have incorporated those ideas into freshdeskwe just got done adding another ssl certificate for our latest products portalthe support team came through again with flying colors,5
we have been very satisfied with our migration to freshdesk and will be moving our other ticketing systems over as wellany time we have had to reach out to their support team they have been quick to respond and have solved our issues promptly,5
we needed an efficient crm system easy to set up an with easy access to analytics to manage our tickets and freshdesk was able to give us that and more we love that its features are based on time we are able to measure agent and team performance on this,5
we are a distribution company that imports several us and european brands into canadawe manage the customer service inquiries for all these brands for canadian customers and retailerswe were previously using outlook inboxes but that became too cumbersomefreshdesk has allowed us to feed all inquiries to one place while still maintaining our separate brands and automatically routing tickets to the appropriate customer services teamour workflows are more efficient and customers are easier to track,5
we have been able to be more responsive to our customers while maintaining high data integrity across our whole businessthe team is able to chat in real time with each other about an individual ticket without confusion and the ability for us all to be in the ticket at the same time to see what is going onthe transparency of our interaction with our customers also mean we can address team training needs and discover any shortfalls of our customer service quickly confidently and positively,5
i would gladly recommend freshdesk as a very competitive option if you are evaluating ticket management software the whole implementation could be done by us in a manner of hours and they have an academy where you can get a certification and learn how to deploy it,5
i am currently the only person responsible for customer support in a small company freshdesk made it much more easy for me to manage support tickets due to slas automations etc i used to have to do pretty much everything manuallywell be adding new users soon because of this great experience,5
prosthe platform is relatively user friendly and has a sufficient number of features to work well,2
prosmy favorite part about this software is the knowledge basethis has helped us immensely on our teamcertain parts of the knowledge base show up based on the company the user is associated withthis allows us to set up public tutorials internal tutorials for our staff then another section that just our internal help desk can useit is also very userfriendly our students and staff can easily create tickets and we are able to customize the fields for ticketsi dont use a lot of the features with phone and automated ticket assignment but i can see how this would be useful for a larger organizationi honestly have no complaints and whenever i have a question or issue support has responded and solved my issue quickly,5
we are an msp and freshdesk is the core of our support business without it we wont be able to keep track of what work needs to be done our client tickets get logged on freshdesk and assigned to technicianstime logs gets added tickets get exported and processed for billingany issues that weve had we simply contacted them via in support chat and it was resolved quickly,5
we have moved from deskcom half a year ago the decision was made based on our comparison we have selected freshdesk as it seemed to give the best value for the price and people also seem really satisfied in general to me freshdesk is a developing underdog on the crm market with some huge advantages and opportunities we selected them because we can have some top notch solutions just like we had freshdesk or zendesk but we do not have to leave a fortune there they still need to spend a lot to improve the software as the market is really competitive with other companies like salesforce zendesk but it seems they have the ambition to be the bestmoving to freshdesk still seems a great decision,5
in general i think there are plenty of customizations and features with freshdesk the real selling point for our company was the analytics because we can see the history of our tickets and prevent them from reoccurring in the future,5
freshdesk has streamlined agent actions and provided a clean and holistic overview of the product for me the product manager the agents are able to work together with better ease and be more efficient with the email notifications on ticket actions the fd support team is incredibly responsive and good at providing alternative solutions if the product doesnt currently support what is being asked,5
overall experience has been amazing so far as it is able to cater our day to day needs great platform to provide internalexternal support,4
freshdesk helped bootup llc to get on top of their user help desk support problems and this nycbased msp is now poised to grow its client base by hiring more technical staff and expanding its support offerings our collective experience with freshdesk has been extremely positive and we recommend it wholeheartedly,5
overall my gripes are relatively minor and for the most part have usable workarounds freshdesk has proven an invaluable tool for our small team and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid ticketing system in fact i already have,5
much more speed and efficiency in our support work flow automation assignements grouping tagging sla monitoring canned responses integrated widget email forwarding facebook integration etc looking forward to integrate the telephony also,5
time saving functionality on many levels less emails in your inbox and less hitting the forward button best part if youre using zendesk you can import your emails from there when you get started the functions in the free version are fantastic help desk helps but responding quickly all private messages on a ticket or message are kept together with the email chain and kept private unless you want the client to see the message recommend this product,4
support and development teams may quickly and easily filter issues in freshdesk using the many available filters using freshdesk has been a simple process another perk is that numerous tickets can be linked to the same major disruption,4
firstly it has vastly improved our customer service with freshdesk we can centralize the management of all customer requests which speeds up our responses and helps us solve issues more quickly on the other side integrating many communication channels into a single setting allows us to process more requests in less time it has also impacted internal collaboration thanks to features that facilitate our agents working together to address an issue or fulfill a request finally it has customer service metrics and reporting capabilities,4
freshdesk has been a very okay tool to use it gets the job done but no more than that,3
the software is good and has big potential i send a lot of feedback unfortunately bug fix process is super slow i wish company will be grateful for the bug report which i provide for free thanks,3
fresh intuitive and a musthave tool for any helpdesk team freshdesk has helped improve helpdesk staff productivity efficiency as well as customer and toplevel satisfaction,5
good experience support is fast to respond its an easy platform to train new team members on,4
get it if you can afford it and have the team to support itotherwise if youre just one walk away son youre done,5
weve seen great results since switching to freshdesk from the multiple email clients our agents were using before to access our customer care emails having all forms of communicationemails chats phone conversations etcinto a one userfriendly interface,4
i enjoy the fact that there are distinct tickets for accidents and service requests which makes it easier to track down problems queues and responsibilities may also be customized and the option to prevent them from seeing other peoples stuff is a nice feature the integrations are fantastic you wont find this kind of customer service anywhere else all of our demands have been met and any difficulties or complaints have been immediately remedied,4
our experience using this software has been quite pleasant it has allowed us to improve communication with our customers exponentially it brings a lot to our customer service and support it has also been advantageous to have configured automatic responses many customers find their answers without contacting an agent in short it has helped us to provide personalized realtime customer service and support to our clientele thus boosting customer satisfaction and efficiently streamlining problem resolution,5
without freshdesk we would have to provide support totally through email with multiple agents in different time zones it would be a nightmare not to have a ticketing system please we can keep track with unresolved issues so our customers can rest assured we have not forgotten about them,5
if you want something relatively cheap although not much cheaper than other options in the market with terrible customer support and zero data reporting go for it otherwise pick literally any other system and save yourself and your team a million headaches and wasted revenue,1
we needed a centralised product to handle communications drive our workload provide automation statistics and be our sole platform across multiple regions and ultimately diverse products freshdesk seems to add the new features we need just before we need them and we can see others that we dont yet need but will eventually grow intoour overall experience has been brilliant from initial small scale setup a few years ago to gradual wider global deployment,5
we use it for our tech support team as well as other teams in itit is super easy to use and easy to customize fields that you needwe are able to keep track of tickets and can assign tickets to other departments to assistthe ability to forward tickets to nonusers makes it easy to keep up with all open tickets in one location,5
overall it is a good product i have tried many similar solutions along but this one worked the best,5
we have a great and effective tool for managing our customer interactions as well as our customer support articles,4
out of all the solutions we explored freshdesk was our choice for help desk servicesand after years we stand by our decision,5
freshdesk is most feasible for midsized companies it also performs well with several large companies however it is probably not a good choice for large companies where blending with different apps and custom development is necessary it is also ideal for small businesses and sole proprietorships as they have very affordable free and paid plans even if you only have a person helpdesk having cases that are customized to a case management system rather than using email will make your existence much more convenient,4
overall its been great they respond to email and phone based support requests quickly and their support people know the product and know what theyre doing you can tell by the evolution of the ui over the years weve been using this product that they do continuous development and are working actively to maintain their system in a market place that changes all the time they actively reach out to their customers and ask for feedback and suggestions as well this product feels like a big product like desk of the larger ticket systems but it also feels small because they are east to reach out to and talk to you like real people,4
we are solving our service crm platform with this softwarei believe it has propelled us forward past our competitors,5
freshdesk took our business to another great level for we have completed eliminated human mistakes absences lost tickets from our operations we are on the way to the perfect customer support experience and freshdesk has assisted us in this all the way,5
i think freshdesk is great if youre looking for a lowcost platform for customer service it solved our issue with redirecting clients to a specific rep for better support but when it comes to integrations i think they have a lot to improve on,4
you can always find someone to help you out each customer is assigned a point of contact poc and regular checks are performed their dedication to their customers is impressive this is an item i would endorse,4
managing tickets and monitoring past communications with customers is a breeze using freshdesk fewer complaints regarding delayed responses and forgotten tickets have been received after launching freshdesk,4
better than anything i have trialled and considered as a replacement including zendesk for all the faults it does its core function well for a reasonable price,4
prosfreshdesk does a good job of simplifying the process of getting up and running with a ticketing system for whatever your business or needs are there are a variety of subscription levels that you can choose from which makes it somewhat nice in terms of what features you need vs which ones you dont need and would rather not pay for the initial setup is a bit to get through to make sure that you have everything customized the way you want it but for the most part once its up and running its pretty close to a set it and forget it environment,5
i have had a fantastic experience with both the software and customer service bang for buck is right on great uiux all around and make sure we are able to receive feedback through various channels and integrate with jira,5
we have been using freshdesk for yearsits been a frustrating experience and has held our team back from working on actual customer servicefeatures disappear when the software is upgraded orrefreshed and you are required to upgrade your plan mo in my case to access features that we had in the past but were taken away with a refreshthere is no notification of features being taken away nor are you given the option to upgrade until you contact your account manager and are told about a price increase,1
support is awesome and try to mimic every scenario that you haveto fix your problemcertain features lac the ability to integrate it with other third party ticketing systemits good for smallmedium level enterprises and fulfills all the basic requirement of ticketing system,5
after considering multiple options we decided to go with freshdesk because it provided the optimal balance of features cost and userfriendliness for our company freshdesks range of tailored features includes ticket management scheduling lead and sales pipeline management knowledge base management project and task management contact database and support ticket management content management service history and contact management in addition to its customizable library of options that can be tailored to suit our specific business requirements,5
its quite expensive for small teams which needs advanced features but in comparison with alternatives the price is ok we use it for more than years and it made our work easier,4
prosour team operates different ecommerce brands out of shopify that have gone up in about a year and halfwe could not have done it without freshdeskto me its similar to shopify in that it is a true example of how building a product based on the user experience then designing your reporting data analytic capabilities can deliver a powerhouse productfreshdesk is a clean intuitive experience that multiple customer service associates have picked up and been ready to roll with in a day or twowe have fully integrated it with our shopify site tickets submitted on our site come through freshdesk as does the onsite chat window all social media comments or posts and our cust service numberas our team member is speaking with or responding to a customer she has all of the information tied to their order right in front of her built into the ticket thats the shopify integrationwe have most recently gotten disciplined about we are using the tags feature which again operates very similarly to how shopify doesour service rep now has a list of all tags that should be connected to tickets and what they meanthis makes it super simple for us to run reports on common customer complaints centralize pr inquiries etc,5
great for using as a ticket system for it,5
i benefit price wise and usability factors great features helpful with customer service great experience with freshworks support on any question i have and always get a thorough response our company has used this for years and will continue to do so,5
i have used it for many years to log all my tickets and it has worked perfectly well in all that time without all the hassle of running an internal system,4
prosuna de las cosas que más me encanta de freshdesk es su increíble conjunto de funciones para la gestión de atención al cliente es una herramienta muy completa que permite a los equipos de soporte responder a los tickets de los clientes de manera rápida y efectiva además la interfaz de usuario es muy fácil de usar y personalizar lo que hace que sea una experiencia agradable trabajar con ellaotra característica que destaca es la sencilla integración con los procesos de la empresa freshdesk se integra perfectamente con otras aplicaciones que ya están en uso lo que significa que los equipos pueden seguir utilizando las herramientas que ya conocen y aman también ofrece una variedad de aplicaciones y complementos de terceros que pueden ayudar a aumentar la productividad y la eficiencia del equipo de soporteen general freshdesk es una solución de atención al cliente excepcional que brinda una experiencia de usuario intuitiva funciones útiles y una gran facilidad de integración es el compañero perfecto para cualquier empresa que busque mejorar su experiencia de atención al cliente,5
it has been a great experience so farwe came from the old bmc remedy and we were looking for a modern ticketing solution freshdesk was a very refreshing update and made our life much easier,4
this is a tool that has helped in increasing productivity of my organization as we get to service our multiple clients with the structured ticketing system tracking unresolved issues has also been made easy and this built trust between our clients and our organization,5
i explored freshdesk quite indepth and was not only amazed by the availability of multiple features but also the comprehensive of all the available features its a commendable effort from the firm hope to see more and more features getting added in the future so that it can maintain its position as a onestop solution for every possible need of a firm wrt customer service,5
it was a game changer from previous ticketing systems i used i would aways choose freshservice but only if you have time to make use of setting up the extra features and can afford the extra cost,4
freshdesk is a great utility and platform for ticketing ticket management and support we have enhanced our support standards with freshdesk for local issues within the organization we have categorized our dev team to use zendesk and our it team to use fresh desk to support more regular issues with staff devices,5
as a growing startup and now a small business we cut our teeth on freshdesk it did a great job early on as it just worked and was easy to use however as we grew we found that it had a productivity crippling flaw one they have known about for years and that is spamonce you get a batch of blatant spam emails from russia that create tickets you quickly realize how bad it can get we have received spam on almost a daily basis for a long time but it was usually ranging from a couple to around or a day you go in and mark the ticket as spam and block the email and are good to go however as we got larger we started getting them in batches of s and then even on that was what made this bad is that the domain and ip were both blacklisted and the content failed standard spam tools with a very high score so this would have been easy to blockso what makes this so painful is that you now have to go manually close and mark as spam those tickets delete emails from your inboxes and try and keep up with your legit ticket queuewhat made this worse is when i went to their support forum and realize this has been a problem for years that they have known about and have showed no interest in fixing beyond the manual processunfortunately this made the difficult decision of changing support systems too easy i wont say who we are switching to as i dont want it to seem i am trying to promote,3
prosthe reporting feature of this software is awesome no matter whatever the timeline is chosen reports get generated within minutes itgives us an insight of our day to day performance newly introduced analytics is great keep it up,4
there are really few complaints as it works very well and meets our needs,5
prosthe freshworks applications are all easily integrated with each other which makes it easy to set up the apps in the marketplace make it easy to integrate with most other systems which is great i evaluated several products over a week and weekend standing up different trials for a proof of concept freshdesk was the only one that i was able to get started with a minimal amount of configuration as in it took me an hour to stand it up create users generate test tickets create responders almost within an hour it was insane how much easier it was than the competition additionally the pricing was easy to understand and flexible enough to grow as we grow,5
great experience as an admin or process coordinator you get a great overview of the agents operation how many tickets have been assigned to each the status how much time it takes to get the tickets resolved and of course it makes it easier to make decisionswe did not use any software before and we constantly got lost emails or forgotten requests because they were all handled through email also it was very difficult to keep track of the agents performance,5
the interface makes sense to use and when i needed guidance the customer support team was super quick to help me get to where i neededwanted to be,5
i started using this service over a year ago i stumbled upon it while trying to find an affordable option for a client with a small budget and was so impressed that i adopted it myself its now my goto recommendation for people who want an integrated service that connects their customer service ticketing system crm live chat support and more back in the day a service like this wouldve cost tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars and wouldnt have been half as easy to use setup or train people on you really cant go wrong with this service especially on the free tier,4
prosfrom what ive seenheard its a more affordable option but with that and the fact that fd is relatively new to the game there are better options out there but fd checks most of the boxes the reporting and analytics leaves a lot to be desired and isnt very reliable but if youre looking for a standard ticketing system that allows you to reach out to customers and prioritize work fd will suit your needs not a lot of bells and whistles but there are customization options and freshworks has been quite accommodating,3
as a software company supporting non technical users we find the system has been able to offer our customers intuitive selfservicefor the questionsissues requiring our assistance it provides efficiency accountability and transparencyit has become an essential part of our continuous improvement loop leading to our growth and customer satisfaction ratings,5
we needed customer support system and helpdesk center both of those were nicely covered with freshdesk features and allow us to enable additional features if our needs grow,5
overall found very good and useful product we are using in the logistics industry and found it very useful to track customer complaints related to shipment delivery clearance delay incorrect addresses and other transportation related issues,4
the use of freshdesk is what makes us different from other outsourcing companies here in cebu we attain to have platform that could capture data requests from all the support channels our clients used and freshdesk is the tool for it i would say its our scaling factor,4
freshdesk has improved customer communication and helpdesk support especially as a ticket tracking solution email integration for virtual help desk freshdesk simplifies task distribution and helps us gauge client happiness,5
its a comprehensive bundle that allows us to answer any queries or concerns our clients may have using this program we are better able to maintain satisfied clientele,4
aside from all the great features we get i have to say the service from support on their email and live chat are very helpful and im grateful to be using a product that can be supported and has a great development team keeping it up to date that in its own is a great benefit,5
prosautomation is one of the coolest feature in this software we used to manually assign the tickets which ended up in lots of tickets being unnoticed or unassigned because of the human error however since we have automated of our volume we have saved not only time but reduced our error rate drastically,5
overall it is a great piece of softwarescalable and easy to use still can improve on a few things,3
weve loved freshdesk since we switched to it about months ago our clients love it too its cool that there is also a knowledgebase feature builtin to help avoid ticket creation for common issues their support has proven helpful when weve needed them the platform is featurerich and the pricing is very competitive,5
the overall experience has been exceptionalthe team is very happy to use it their knowledge base and crm features are very useful we dont feel that we will shift to any other service in the coming years,5
overall freshdesk has been a positive experience for us as an organisationcompared to other offerings there is nothing which would change our decision to use it would recommend,5
id definitely recommend anyone who are looking for an integrated helpdesk platform to try it out especially startups with a budget,5
my overall experience with freshdesk is that i am frustrated with the level of service and the flexibility of the product,2
prosla chiarezza grafica e lordinazione dei ticket in modo facile da gestire tra noi colleghi,4
overall experience has been good primarily because of the excellent technical support,5
prosthe ability to setup up multiple channels direct for specific clients the call routing of ddis and reporting is important to monitor kpisthere are lots of great features such as automations which is great when you are an active helpdesk dealing with hundreds of tickets daily,4
prosone thing that i liked the most about freshdesk is their customization to ticket editing i was able to design my tickets very easily with no additional help which is a very nice thing to have in the future i look forward to continuing my new designs in tickets and using more of its features to do so another thing that i enjoyed about freshdesk is the organization tools that they have which makes it super easy to access things i feel the whole time im using freshdesk i know where everything is and never fear losing anything or not being able to find the things i need,4
prosat some point we had too many mailboxes and too much email to properly track customer emails so we switched to freshdesk and now we can stay on top of everything we dont use it as a traditional ticketing system we run all our email through it but it works canned responses are useful alerts when agents are working on an email at the same time or if a response has just been sent while you were typing really help to avoid unintended miscommunication and using automations its possible to make up for any missing out of the box features like snoozing an emailwe use it every day while i have some issues with it were basically running our business out of it so im pretty happy with it overall,4
coming to work either at the home or office is such a pleasure as i know that all of my work is up to date and clearcut credit to the freshdesk ticketing system our department has had many debates initially but knows we all are thriving on this product and are super happy with it a key feature would be the freshdesk mobile application i can be on the go and still stay in touch with my customers throughout the day whilst providing realtime support,5
we use freshdesk as our support platform for our saas productits been great so far and the portal for customers has been a huge benefit for uswe came from using zendesk where i felt we were being overcharged and has to purchase too many different products to accomplish the end goal of a support platform,5
weve used freshdesk for a couple of years making use of the support ticket system the knowledge base and forumsthe system has been reliable and easy to usegetting set up and going was simplethe company has made regular updates and improvementstheir editor for creating articles works well even allowing simple clipboard paste of imagesscreenshots rather than having to go through an upload process to make them available unlike mailchimp we were nervous about support when it was clear we were getting transferred to an overseas center when we called but we were pleasantly surprised that each support call was handled quickly professionally and in a helpful manner without long hold times these guys are the exception to the rule in that regardconclusion good product at fair price from a good company,5
the freshdesk made our companys tasks run faster and more efficiently ending a major gap of lack of communication between teams,5
overall freshdesk has been a great addition to the business i think that the support has been good though sometimes a little slow occasionally disappointing if they dont know the answer or cant get you an answer you get shrugged off or forgotten about,5
overall i am a huge promoter of the product in my office i think its a helpful tool for us to stay on top of our tickets,4
freshdesk is a helpdesk platform that runs in the cloud and provides strong customer service solutions freshdesk streamlines communication across platforms by combining conversations from email phone online chat and social media freshdesk will manage slas provide accessible selfservice choices automate workflows and generate reports using freshdesk over businesses including bridgestone hp harvard university and dhl use freshdesk,5
fantastic used it for all of my professional career within the it industry and i will continue to use it,5
overall experience is very satisfactory the user interface is very well defined and structured the pre embedded customer satisfaction survey makes this software even more desirable to have,4
prosi am a it jack of multi trades for my company one of those roles is the sole contact for internal technical support i came across freshdesk years ago and have loved it ever sincemy favorite feature of freshdesk initially was the customization options for tickets it allowed me to tailor the ticket template to exactly what worked for me i was also able to adjust the remainder of the admin settings to make freshdesk work exactly how i needed it to for how i logged tickets with my organizationfreshdesk also has several great features that i dont use personally but i think would be very beneficial to larger teams etci looked at several leading solutions before deciding on freshdesk but they required me to follow a mandatory process workflow or their customization options were limitedfreshdesk surprised me with all it was packed withi havent had to contact freshdesk support on many occasions over the past years but they were always fast and friendly when i did require some help,5

we love freshdesk as it has made helpdesk support seamless for us it has made our department efficient and professional,5
after doing quite a lot of research i thought its a really good system but once i started using only i started finding problems freshdesk is cheap but some very important features dont work contact syncing with google doesnt work if you integrate facebook then you will have more problems than what it is worth in my case messages come through after a delay and some of the messages done even come through the integration also started creating s of contacts non stop it stopped only after disconnecting the integration i requested to delete those contacts more than a month ago and they are still there if you integrate whatsapp you cant send pictures it creates duplicate contacts for existing contactscompany segmentation doesnt work if things were clearly explained upfront there is no problem the software is priced cheap but it is used by customers small and big around the globe i would say they should be more professional and should not include obvious bugs in the live release,2

the overall experience was good but they could work a little more on improving the performance of their apis,4
great for independent ventures and simple to use while looking great yet high level elements like review logs dont cover administrator board changes and robotizing messages can be customized for whatsapp source tickets so its really great for a starter and halfway organization however inside and out highlights and customizations can be gotten to the next level,5
we use freshdesk daily the platforms and other services we use with our educational site all use freshdesk for their support ticket system it ensures we have a great product as so many high powered companies trust and use the same platform,5
weve used freshdesk for about year for all our help desk ticketsit works great for our small team of one tech support guy and one marketing guyfor our size team the product is free compared to other products that wanted month for the same features,5

my overall experience tracking customer support tickets has been awesomewish there would be a new feature to enable me spool my reports monthly instead of picking them manually,5
im not currently using this software in the company im working at right now but i do think from my previous experience using ticket softwares that freshdesk has a visually appealing ui and most times has no issues even though i didnt use all the integrations it has with other platforms im aware my coworkers were happy with the ease of use,4
prosthis software is used by almost customers all over worldit has delivered solution in two categorize one is for enterprise and other is for smbs my experience with software is very good i receiveddaily approximate emails of my customerssometime email reply was missed by customer care staff than customers dissatisfied and frustrated with gap now with this software our every email is converted in to ticket and proper reply to the customerswe are happy to use this softwarewe can track easily biggest issue of any customer and resolve asap,5
it is good but it can be more efficient,3
great crm with lots of options and flexibility marginal customer support could have better adjustment of slas and metrics,4
prosthe unique thing which freshdesk offers and others do not is that they offer the ability to forward a ticketconversation to a third person outside your organization and agents without letting the requester of the ticket know i have not found this functionality in any other helpdesks i have used so far also their support is very responsive and puts every bit of their knowledge to solve the issues,3
really positive feedback from the team and clients if a client called up it was easy to write up the comments and issues they were experiencing and then assign the tickets to team members to deal with really sped up our response times,5
within freshdesk i solve technical problems for our clients here at consult design if there is an issue with a clients website an email will come into freshdesk and here it will be dealt with as freshdesk is our support central i really enjoy using freshdesk and use it daily with ease great software,5
prosmy favorite part of freshdesk is that it is the best tool and definitely most affordable to support multiproduct brands that is if branda has productb and productc and productd and you want to filter tickets and specifically title them in the email subject line for the products they represent you can do so easily with freshdesk zendesk requires a higher tier payment plan for the same functionality and the smallernewer helpdesk services dont support this type of feature their support is very accessible and they will go the extra mile to ensure you get supported they will even help with some development to some extent even if it falls outside the scope of the project,4
in terms of managing the tickets i have found fresh desk very reliable because sometimes one of our agents is working on the tick and if he gets stuck the other agents has the access to desk with that so no compromise is done on our clients services i am very happy with its services,5
overall expersience of the freshdesk is out of the box it helps in various crm and customer support system but it could have been better in the pricing system so that it could be more easily accessible and affordable,4
prosfreshdesk is very much appropriate for an organisation which has a huge client base the dashboard of freshdeskgives a overall picture to the agents who are resolving the tickets on how many are pending and how many are resolved this has a creative and user friendly interface customers can raise the tickets in an easy manner and also customers would be able to track their ticket status and also comment on them it is a beneficial tool for both customer and business in sorting out an issue the agents would also feel convenient in keeping track in the tickets the tickets goes exactly to the relevant clusters freshdesk provides the feature of adding a comment before closing the ticket this gives the notification to all the other team members that the ticket is closed it also gives an overall graphical representation of the tickets which would give a trend on thetickets received so the agents would get an idea and cater to the tickets accordingly,5
it gets the job done but for the price i would not personally recommend this searching for anything in there is a complete nightmare and i just think theres probably better options for this price range,3
enables me to be effective in my business and ensures satisfied clients provides me with full control and visibility of ticketing status,5
prosi love the way this software accepts a number of sources creating tickets in a unique interface that simplifies agents life when replying to customersit doesnt matter if we get emails or whatsapp messages or other messaging system they all converge in a single system where we can forget about the source and concentrate on customer needs,4

proswe have implemented this management system for a long time and have never regretted it most of all i like the detailed collection of statistics due to this we can conduct an analysis of the effectiveness of our employees,5
prosi like the chat feature when your clients want to reach you asapi also like the fact that it lets you know via email when a customer replies to your email and when someone closes or reopens a ticketi also like the parked responses that you can configure most especially if you will need to reply to a lot of tickets in a short amount of time,5
this is a simple to use yet robust helpdesk platform that we currently utilize in two different departments within my org it and maintenance to make ticket creation and management simplei also use this as an example when other helpdesk vendors ask me what it would take to get my business if they cant at least match the features and price theres no reason to have that discussionwere customers of both the free and paid version two separate helpdesks in use but the introduction of both within my organization have been overwhelmingly received as positive and our maintenance department sings its praises almost daily,5

i would like the application to have more search filters because when handling many customers finding one in particular can be time consuming integrating all the programs we needed was a slow process and the technical team did not provide the expected help so we had to hire an external service to solve the problem,4
prosfreshdesk makes it so much easier to handle tickets in our company customers can simply send emails to our support team and tickets are created and then allocated to the relevant peoplewe are also able to respond to tickets via the freshdesk dashboard and it will come through the customer as a reply,5

i like freshdesktheres a lot of features in the software that are helpful it can sometimes be hard to understand all of them at first but once you dive into the software its very helpful in streamlining the ticketing process,5
i have trialled and evaluated all popular helpdesk apps like freskdesk zayanko zendesk hiver and others i tested all of them with our actual marketplaces and the actual support email address freshdesk is the best overall sadly we dont take up with freshdesk because of the cost reasons for support users when we need different users so we choose another helpdesk for unlimited users and the limited tickets pricing planif you ask me which to choose zendesk or freshdesk i would recommend freshdesk over zendesk,5
this programme is probably the most comprehensive tool for customer support because it enables us to serve our consumers across all platforms including social media phone calls emails websites and sms messages from a single control panel ensuring that no request is missed we can use a feature in it to organise our requests into priority lists based on their importance,4

in general my experience with the freshdesk ticket machine was very good we use it daily in the company and it is the backbone of our it support system i recommend it for its ease of use its performance and its fair price,5
while we appreciate the overall look and feel of the tool i think that there should be a lot more options in order to stick to it as sole ticketing system,3

i can not but praise this application is fantastic,5
i recommend this app because it is really useful especially in communicating,5
customer care is a click awayalways presentableno followup is requiredall the best,5
its hard to imagine a day without me opening the freshdesk portal as it gives me a complete snapshot of the day i have ahead which helps plan the work and get it executed as such,5
it is a very good platform but they need to improve their customer service to improve and have a quality product they are,3
prosfreshdesk excels in optimizing customer support with its multichannel access selfservice options robust analytics and customizable features enabling businesses to deliver outstanding customer experiences,5
we have done quite well we have already more than tickets attended with the tool in our subscriptionsit has allowed us to keep a good control of our service and has allowed us to improve response times and quality of service since the reports help to keep each ticket impartially between us and the clients,5
our experience is great and we are happy to continue using zendesk,5
the service before the sale was exceptional however we found out too late that the service we purchased is not the service we were shown there is no way to get support for the product everything costs extra,3
id be lost without zendesk for our customer support,5
prosit literally keeps track of everythingand we have the ability to add in more parametersas well as take away parameters if no longer needed,5
prosas an administrator zendesk offers a comprehensive set of tools for managing customer support operations the ticketing system is robust and customizable allowing us to tailor workflows to our specific needs the reporting and analytics features provide valuable insights into support performance metrics enabling us to identify trends and areas for improvement,5
proswe like zendesk because it makes it easy for our team to connect with our customers and address any issues they have with our products we can build credibility because our after sales communication was improved dramatically when we started using zendesk,5
overall its bee a great experience i definitely recommend it,4
proszendesk suite provides an userfriendly interface you can easily get in contact with the customersusers through support tickets the system organization is pretty neat as you can establish which member of the support team gets assigned the tickets,4
overall it was decent maybe not applicable in the veterinary setting but in other settings i can see it being very successful,3
their customer service is wonderful and theyll bend over backwards for you but the options i found that were absent at even the highest most expensive levels really made me disappointedthey are able to track utm codes which is great if youre using google analytics but if this isnt a concern of yours i highly recommend searching for a more affordable alternative with more customizationtheyre out there,4
horrible i only use this software because it would be a hassle porting all existing tickets over to a different platform i needed billing support from them and my ticket was escalated to the finance department but nobody ever got back to me in time literally a few days went by and not one word from my zendesk agent they have a poor support system so if you dont ever need help with anything and know what youre doing then zd is probably for you,5
we wanted out of box support solutions so we moved from salesforce to zendesk so we dont have deployment cost in zendesk everything comes out of box and as an admin u just to read their knowledge kb and configurat the system to meet ur business needs we have achieved x chat support services with the help of zendesk chat which is a excellent software,5
we can use this data to improve the client experience by putting new processes in place weve increased our output significantly and now everything is in plain sight its incredible how much freedom we have when it comes to putting up a selfhelp library for our clientele we were able to create a help center based on the copenhagen theme but we customized it to our liking with custom css styling,4
having a track of support tickets we are getting and how many of them are solved how much average time they are taken to get solved and who had solved them etc these metrics are something that we cant get access in traditional email platforms zendesk is the platform that helped us in setting up all these things with ease and solved the biggest headache of ours,5
zendesk is a solid cloudbased tool and very good value for moneywe operate it since and it doesnt give us many problems we probably not using it to its full capacity as it is mostly used as a dispatch tool hooked up with online forms,5
extremely simple to set up and begin using immediately the agents are really enthusiastic about it and have accepted it quickly super userfriendly and packed with options excellent for plugging into preexisting infrastructure and developing bespoke apis,4
my overall experience with zendesk suite has been positive the platform offers a comprehensive solution for customer support seamlessly integrating various tools to streamline processes and enhance the overall efficiency of our support operations the intuitive interface robust ticket management and knowledge base features contribute significantly to providing a better customer support experience,4
our company has been using zendesk for years i was not personally around when we onboarded it but i have worked with it for over years now we have terrible trouble any time we did need support for a system problem or a question we couldnt answer ourselves via their expansive maze of knowledgebase the support reps at zendesk have been accusatory excuseridden and most of all dont even read the tickets you submit to understand the problem zendesk support actually became an office joke thats about the time we decided we had to look for another tool when we met with our account rep to try to get some of the issues worked out we were told basically that we werent even supposed to have gotten the level of support we had received and proceeded to explain how saas works were a software company mind you i think zendesk simply got too big too fast and somewhere along the way decided that the businesses using their product arent important anymore they lost this longterm customer,4
prosthe format of the ticket interface lends its self to serving email based communications very well at a glance i can easily see all tickets sent by a specific requester or business and prioritize based on the severity of the issues being described the help center and chat button that can be integrated into custom applications can be a game changer when it comes to self service inbound and outbound call recordings are super critical especially for our finance team to ensure we have a reliable means of keeping proof of what was said,5
the initial steps of getting everything up and running may require some extra effort and time to navigate through when it comes to customization i have noticed certain limitations within zendesk suite while there are options available i have found that users might feel restricted when trying to customize ticket forms chat widget appearance and reporting templates having more extensive customization options would greatly benefit businesses as it would allow us to align the software more closely with our branding and specific requirements this level of customization would help create a consistent and personalized experience for our customers,4
overall positive i liked being an admin greatly as well as i like being a user submitting my concerns to different companies and brands seeing them use zendesk makes me feel good knowing they are using a trustworthy product i also know if they dont respond easily it must be on them as a company as everything is tracked such as time and date so it is easy to set ttr metrics using this product,5
my overall experience with zendesk has been phenomenal as our employees have taken a very big liking to it which allows them to enjoy their jobs more resulting in greater and more efficient work flow for the rest of the business zendesks own customer service has been there when we needed them and for that we are really thankful even though they are rarely needed due to the stability and ease of use of the service,5
my general experience has been perfect it makes my work exceptionally simple with regards to giving client support and approach client information to all the more likely help i enthusiastically suggestall in all zendesk suite is a useful asset for overseeing client care tasks its broad highlights including call logging call directing continuous endlessly talk records make it a thorough answer for smoothing out client collaborations while it very well might be delayed on occasion the general involvement in zendesk suite has been positive giving a solid and effective method for overseeing client service,4
this software has been really efficient since not only it allows to give a good attention to the client but also it is possible to do a followup to the attention agents to know who stands out the most who are available to take care of the client and this makes that not wait for any client but all are served in the best way possible and you can solve their problems in the shortest time there is also no way to have a collapse in the channels as there are different channels of attention that can be chosen to suit each client that is why i think zendesk is a tool with great potential and can be used in any type of company regardless of the size of it,4
overall our experience with zendesk as a support ticketing system has been good while a bit expensive for the amount of features we use the integrations and automations available work well with our current client workflow and processes,4
zendesk is so robust but it is not at all intuitive learning how to generate a report was a full time job and i never quite figured it out to really get comfortable with tracking the mass amount of data we had generated through all of our ticketshowever i really wanted to learn it and their customer success team worked with us to help develop trainings so we could utilize it better,4
despite the small problem i had with the learning curve initially i felt that as the months went by i gained greater mastery and speed in solving all types of cases using this platform the ease of integrating it with other company systems such as crm and automating processes was highly valued overall i find zendesk suite greatly streamlined my daily tasks as a support agent focusing more on the customer than the systems i would definitely recommend this solution to any company that needs to provide operational excellence in their help desk,5
overall zendesk is an easytouse reliable crm platform that integrates well with most popular order processing platforms webstores shipping logistics services and can handle intricate operations such as subscription administration phone calls live chat support and more also the reporting features available offer alot of flexibility to create reports that are helpful for your business and goals in customer support i chatted on zendesk daily and love the way it handles live chat support for agents,4
zendesk suite is good for businesses as it centralizes customer inquiries enables efficient tracking and resolution improves response times enhances collaboration among support teams and provides valuable analytics for performance evaluation and continuous improvement,5
in my overall experience with zendesk suite it has been a gamechanger for my business resolving critical pain points and delivering a range of benefits as a small business owner i faced several challenges in managing customer support effectively but zendesk suite has transformed the way i interact with my customers and streamlined my support operationsfirstly zendesk suites multichannel support has been a lifesaver with the ability to manage customer queries and issues across email live chat social media and phone i can meet my customers wherever they prefer to reach out this has significantly improved customer satisfaction and response times as i can provide timely assistance on their preferred platformsanother standout benefit is the integrated knowledge base offered by the suites guide module creating and publishing help articles and faqs has empowered my customers to find answers on their own reducing the strain on my support team this selfservice option has not only saved time for both my customers and staff but has also improved customer engagement and empowered my customers to troubleshoot common issues independentlyfurthermore zendesk suite has helped me gain valuable insights into my support operations through its reporting and analytics capabilities with explore i can track key metrics monitor agent performance and identify trends to make datadriven decisions this has enabled me to optimize my support processes allocate resources,4
ticket management live chat call center integration and knowledge base management but also the ability to customize the software to fit specific needs is a major bonus,5
zendesk suite è una piattaforma di supporto clienti completa che offre molte funzionalità tra cui ticketing chat conoscenza base analytics e automazione queste funzionalità aiutano le aziende a fornire un supporto efficiente e personalizzato ai clienti zendesk offre anche molte opzioni di personalizzazione e integrazione con altre app e servizituttavia zendesk suite può essere costoso e complesso da configurare e utilizzare per alcune aziende e potrebbe avere limitazioni nella personalizzazione e nellintegrazione inoltre linterfaccia utente potrebbe non essere intuitiva per alcuni utentiin generale zendesk suite è una soluzione potente e completa per le aziende che cercano di fornire un supporto clienti di alta qualità ma è importante considerare i propri requisiti e valutare se soddisfa le proprie esigenze,5
our experience with zendesk suite has been extremely positive the software is intuitive and easy to use making it simple for our team to efficiently handle customer inquiries and concerns the ticket management feature in particular has been incredibly impactful allowing our team to prioritize and organize customer inquiries in a way that maximizes efficiency and effectivenessthe sales pipeline management feature has also been a valuable asset as it helps our team stay on top of potential sales opportunities and effectively manage and close deals the multichannel communication feature is also a standout as it enables our team to communicate with customers through a variety of channels providing convenience and flexibilityintegration with other applications and services has been seamless allowing our team to easily access and utilize the information and tools they need to provide the best possible customer support the reporting and analytics feature provides valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences allowing us to make datadriven decisionszendesk suite has been a valuable asset to our company helping us to improve our customer support and resulting in a positive customer experience its also worth noting that zendesk suites customer support is topnotch they are always available to assist and answer any questions and they constantly release updates to improve the software,5
prosone of the things i like most about zendesk suite is its ability to centralize and streamline customer service operations zendesk suite offers a wide range of features such as helpdesk ticketing live chat phone support selfservice portals and more which allows businesses to manage customer interactions across multiple channels this makes it easy for businesses to provide fast efficient and personal customer service which can be particularly important for businesses that rely on customer loyalty,5
zendesk has been helpful for us to help collect our emails form captures and calls sort them within a ticketing system and prioritize the tickets as needed and send them to the person who will reply not having someone who has to answer the phone and then pass that message to the appropriate person is a big help for us,4
for a company that specializes in customer service they are a joke it takes several days to get a response from someone you will never get support from someone in your time zone so when they do respond it will be during overnight hours they also will not have a phone number or post their working hours in their signatures they dont even use their own product correctly i have received emails showing one name in the from line and a totally different name in the signature their automations will also send at inappropriate times i responded to an agents request for more details the agent responded and stated that they are working on the issue soon after i received an automation stating they havent heard from me and are closing the ticket they will also try to charge you to get your data exported dont fall for it there are free programs that will do this for you quickly and easily including all of your knowledgebase articles and the images associated with them when importing to another system you will need to reinsert the images within the articles because they are no longer hosted on zendesk but the free export programs offered by competitors will name the files in a way that makes it clear and easy to identify which image goes where,3
zendesk provided us with great flexibility to deal with customer requests and inquiries and enabled us to increase the speed of response as well as enable us to document all procedures automatically and the reports it provides to us are comprehensive and we can always take advantage of them to develop our operations,5
customer queries used to be managed in excel still it was timeconsuming to track history and the status of responses could not be managed resulting in cases where there were omissions in responses however with the introduction of zendesk it is possible to aggregate by tags and monitor trends easily since it is possible to manage matchno match status there are no match omissions,4
we are really pleased with the zendesk platform since then weve seen an increase in the quality of service we provide to our customers i particularly appreciated the ease with which a new manager or technician could be added to the system without requiring a significant overhaul of the dashboard,4
using zendesk our customer care representatives are able to obtain the information they need on their own when i handle the articles i hear nothing but good things about how this program makes my job easier and more productive they may use slack to look for answers and the results will be linked to relevant articles in zendesk zendesk may be easily integrated with other services such as slack,4
zendesk is our ticketing platform at present again it helps us connect with our employees who need assistance whenever necessary another feature of the software is it can host a page containing a library of helpful articles and documentation for our customers these articles can also have secured visibility by assigning user segments allowing us to manage effectively,4
zendesk provides a good ticket management system knowledge base platform hosting documents with securitybased permissions and insights comparing to competitors such as freshdesk or jira even though they are cheaper they cant provide the functionalities that zendesk provides zendesk allows us to perfectly track our cases analyze the performance through insights allowing us to understand what we have to improve in order to improve our customer csat,5
zendesk is the most customizable ticket system in the market a lot of features that can help to automate things plus you can also install apps that could be useful,5
ive used zendesk in all of the ventures ive participated in unfortunately i get it that in it was an easy option but today there are plenty more and plenty of options of building out solutions yourself if customer support means everything to you,1
customer support is terrible they do have an unqualified customer success team we requested a feature and it took them over months with emails back and forth to let us know they can get it done when i tried to cancel the contract they said we can not cancel it because you have another year on a contract which was incorrect the success manager was still thinking we are in after i pointed that out they still refused to cancel the contract my advice to this company is a legacy and you should look into a more modern system and there is alot of them out there,1
while there are a couple of issues with zendesk overall i find it a far preferable option to dealing with these tickets through email slack or a personal basis barring cases where this would be the better solution if you are getting enough volume of tickets that support ticket software seems like itd help your business you can afford to get it,4
zendesk has helped me to perform better the solution of any problem that our clients may have has given us the possibility of creating automatic responses through different forms of communication thus it has made my work so fast and easy its reporting function is also really very beneficial to see what the trends are in sending emails to our dissemination team zendesk has a great possibility to gradually increase the functions of our companies helping us to move towards success in a reliable and safe way,5
overall zendesk allowed us to create a new ticketing platform and process for the business its integration with slack drove great user adoption and encouraged submissions this platform allowed us to report on the most common it and biz ops issues at our org while allowing agents to service and help the team effectively its pretty ideal that you can manage your workload triage requests and reply to folks all in a few clicks its really allinone if you integrate with your crm too,5
we used zendesk at of my last jobs the last at my suggestion we handle a diverse amount of different customer issues and its a great system to manage and track all the different interactions our customers are having as well as the agents that are handling them,5
i cant stress enough how easy zendesk makes it to pass tickets back and forth between people and teams my team gets a constant flow of tickets and we are able to keep them organized by time urgency and topic all customer emails and voicemails that are incoming to my department are received in zendesk and its very simple to either respond or make a note and pass along the ticket to the correct person zendesk contributes enormously to my companys efficiency and overall organization,4
overall zendesk makes customer service more efficient as a manager im able to see my employees satisfaction ratings how long they spent that day answering emails how long it takes them in general to answer an email how long they spent on the phone etc zendesk has been great in streamlining my customer service team while also optimizing the customers experience,5
prosi struggle to find good things to say it works and rarely has performance problems if you need very basic support ticketing and are just starting out you could use it and be successful we did but the functionality and support for those organizations between startup and large corporation is nil if we were a very large organization i could see it being a valuable product,1
zendesk is an easytouse dynamic intuitive customer service tool that allows the use of macros to optimize messages to customerszendesk is easy to implement and with adaptable prices i have recommended this tool to several friends for their organizations,5
zendesk really is the best crm i have ever used and i was in customer service for years by far and away the most intuitive simple and clean user experience you will have for a consumer facing cr interface,4
we use zendesk to manage our inbound support account service helpdesk and requests from our contact page in order to communicate with users we collect bug reports and enhancement requests from users and can troubleshoot and monitor requests through various systems we have integrated it is the foundation on which we base the way we interact with our customers when they come to us,5
a wonderful tool to have on our resort website this tool has helped my team and myself close sales in less than mins definitely a great tool for support as well its a faster and convenient way for clients to reach out to us and get information which leads to great costumer service my team is very satisfied with zendesk chat and we look forward to its continuous updates it is part of our sales support team keep up the good job,5
it did the job we needed it to do until we found a better option,3
prosthis software allows me to take calls handle tickets handle chats and review my internal resources in one place different departments have different queues to keep everyones work separated and with a quick switch of an assignee you can escalate or deescalate tickets as needed the software allows the creation of macroscanned responses that can be limited to specific teams but are easily accessible whether it be for a ticket or a chat the phone call plug in and chat plug ins are easily accessible as well and can be deactivated for users who should not have access to those features the chat and phone call notifications are loud and consistent so an agent wont ever miss a service request unless due to negligence or poor connection you can customize how many chats an agent should handle at a time and how long an agent can get wrap up time after a call tickets are automatically populated after a phone call or chat has been established so an agent can follow up with a customer after theyve spoken with them in real time other features of zendesk that i like is it can be used as a help center for faqs and an onboarding site so you can use it for job postings to outline the criteria for jobs or gigs and for the application,5
zendesk has been an amazing tool you have all the options you need to work more efficiently and as part of a team it has so many features that you never stop finding new options to improve the work in the team it is user friendly and it has a clear interface you just need to take your time to find and learn how to apply all the features to your everyday taks i will definitely recommend it,4
in conclusion zendesk suite is a powerful tool for managing customer service operations its extensive features including call logging call routing realtime chat and chat transcripts make it a comprehensive solution for streamlining customer interactions while it may be slow at times the overall experience with zendesk suite has been positive providing a reliable and efficient way to manage customer support,4
to be honest the overall experience after using zendesk in our department has been great we are always on top of our metrics and this is mostly because the platform helps us run our business smoothly ticket automation and being able to customize our ticket system so it can fit our specific needs is one of its best features,5
overall zendesk is great helpdesk and provide multiple features that an enterprise need to handle huge customer base and track tickets and complaints on the go they should think of support system in mobile app too also i am not much satisfied with their customer support as they couldnt resolve many of the issues like reviving a lost ticket forms due to mistakenly closed issues,4
the worst customer supporttheir product appears to provide so much but its so convoluted that its nearly impossible for new customers to set up without assistance from the firm however whenever we met with someone who managed our account we expressed our worries about not knowing how to perform certain things what would be the reactions ill email you zendesk support articles okay ive been googling it and plainly it hasnt helped which is why im requesting assistance from a zendesk representative we were advised that if we stated that we needed additional assistance we would have to pay a large sum of money to have a specialized person assist us were already paying so much to utilize your platform which has so many technical issues at the very least provide some sort of helpneedless to say we left after years of struggling to use their platform thanks for never helping,2
we are using zendesk for all support and it has been greatour customers view us as a big company and we are a small companywe love zendesk talk as it has saved us from implementing a phone system,5
the time savings across departments are massive and it has allowed us to have a much more joined up and structure approach across our business it has also dramatically improved the service we can support our clients with due to better prioritization visibility and workflows applied to tickets,4
tremendous scaling benefits adding more users is not just easy but we have recourse to ensure that our teams can grow at their own paces without worrying if the software can keep up zendesk can absolutely keep it it does not even flinch,5
id definitely recommend zendesk to others its an easy to use software widely known and our clients really benefit from it,5
profoundly amazing giving the best experience to customers and creating a wonderful working environment for all,5
zendesk is super easy to use and to communicate with different other teams is very easyverygood customer support and it has support zendesk has a great job in seriously improving their product listening to their customers and releasing new features to make their customers feel very happy it is fully featured and comprehensive,5

overall my year experience using zendesk was incredibly positive i enjoyed both using it and configuring it and would easily recommend it to others plus i think their support team did a great job whenever we had a question we always got effective and timely replies,5
overall working with zendesk has been a breeze its userfriendly simple and quick the zendesk team is always available to answer questions or help you pull reports i never want to use another ticketing system,5
overall a great piece of software i would say its easy to use has so many addons out there as well it feels like you can customize it to work the way that you want to work with it,4
its the most customized and more simplified software which gives you the chance to install apps which you may have found usefulits the bestthe experience was satisfying,5
proszendesk makes it easy to manage your supportcustomer service queue offering a userfriendly dashboard custom modes for communicating with userscustomers and bench marking statistics both within your team and against industry averages that help you understand how you stack up against other team members as well as competitors with such a vast database of industries within their portfolio zendesk has been able to optimize their system helping businesses across the business spectrum have used this software in different industries and it is responsive to all types of support communication also gives businesses the ability to customize their system which allows for a great feelbranding opportunity in some cases,4
this platform is the best complete and versatile solution that allows any company to efficiently manage its customer service in the simplest and most comfortable way possible although it has some disadvantages and can be expensive for some businesses the benefits it offers such as centralizing customer communication and automating tasks make it a valuable tool for improving the customer experience using this tool with adequate training and a solid strategy offers exceptional customer service which makes a difference in the satisfaction and loyalty of each customer,5
zendesk suite enables me to manage custom fields for each support case and specify certain fields as mandatory for resolving itit also facilitates improved management and control over the status of each request and our overall workload at any given timeadditionally the tool provides me with a comprehensive kpi suite allowing for a deeper understanding of our daily operations and how things are evolving over time,5
overall my experience has been fabulous as the experience is seamless i would recommend companies having crm requirement to try the software based on their need for their own view on it,5
this tool has generally met our needs but may not have been the correct choice for our specific use if there was an app for endusers and some further customization available it may be able to become what we had hoped it would be it does do what it is meant to do very well it should just be clear that there are limits to its customization,4
its really a simple to use application which assists my organization in collation and processing of clients realtime data this helped my organization in organizing our services and making improved responses to customer complaints and this definitely built a considerable amount of trust thumbs up to zendesk,5
we utilize zendesk as our core crm and ticketing solution for email chat text and analytics,5
frankly i set this up and rarely used it all it did was basically get used an email filter for my support email address i take some blame on never implementing it to its potential but it didnt have the integrations i needed to be truly useful so i sort of forgot about the account being openi say a pending charge on my cc and went online and canceled the service immediately that was feb ththe final change didnt clear my credit card until the the th,1
overall id say that the zendesk suite multichannel support has been a lifesaver managing the customer interactions in only one platform gives us an overview in the life cycle of each customer it helps agents see the bigger picture the customers are having be proactive in terms of resolutions they can spot trends and also see what self help articles the customers used zendesks suite reporting and dashboards are giving us a useful insight in how our team is performing and we can easily spot areas of improvement while celebrating each success we have,5
overall zendesk was the right tool that helped us with an influx of emails when we could no longer keep a regular inbox organized workout breaking the bank even though we could have gotten a lot more out of it by upgrading our account for what we spent we were satisfied,4
their help during challenges has been brilliant and responsive regardless of how confounded or top to bottom the issue could end up being,5
ive had a good experience as their default options meet our requirements however to make the software more beneficial for us and more personalized weve had to jump through loops and hoops with sometimes not getting a resolution from their side as to what we wish to do in their system,4
for a company that is supposed to support customer service this has been a truly terrible customer service experience,4
zendesk helped think about customer support from just answering ticketsservicing customers but as a suite and as a holistic service,5
successful experience zendesk chat is my daily ally to provide proper aid to our visitors,5
we are answering customer tickets and delegating them to various team members but the service is not worth the exorbitant price we have been paying for it,2
overall zendesk is easy to use interface and options are quite straight forward response is quicker and easy to manage the logsrequeststickets and users,5
my overall experience was excellent zendesk is a very solid and well made software thats easy to use and convenient,5
prosi have like so many features of zendesk and the easiness to use them before implementing more of zendesk in my day i would get messages from my managers and other team members from chats or emails i felt overwhelmed with keeping track with who said what and if i actually completed the task at hand when i switched i had my team reach out to a support email we had connected to zendesk which helped me get a grasp to claim ownership and see all of the completed the tasks asked to be done i saw patterns of requests so i took more moments to teach others how to fix the problem if possible to allow more time for other projectsmy company also uses this platform for our customer service team i like to see we can have both it and customer service on one platform while also knowing there can be more expansion to other departments in the office space each group can see ticket request come in if theyre still open or pending and if closed outthere support team is great and they have a great knowledge base full of helpful tips and answers to any questions you might have,5
prosthe product is easy to use and easy zendesk suite is the ultimate customer support solution that empowers businesses to deliver exceptional experiences across multiple channels by unifying various functionalities automating processes and providing valuable insights it enhances support team efficiency and customer satisfaction whether youre a small business or a global enterprise zendesk suite equips you with the tools to build strong customer relationships and drive business growth embrace the power of zendesk suite and revolutionize your customer support operations,5
we have had zendesk for almost years now the value is good for what you pay for but they continue to make very bad changes without telling you functionality disappears and they have always lacked some key metrics for reporting,3
prosi use zendesk talk on a daily basis from past years zd talk is being used by the company which i am working for and all our other sister concerns as well zd talk has been separated by brands in the system and we are managing the companies calls come in and go out from the software and it is very rare that we face an issue and mostly it is fixed with a little bit of tweaking in the settings or providing privileges our whole software support team and professional services use the product to interact through it and get all personnel updated i have myself asked many of the it industry users to opt zd talk as it can be used flawlessly with less internet speed as well and it does take much of the internet usage overall i have been very satisfied with the product the most prominent pros are i can call and transfer calls as well use of call recordings and merging of calls from one to another,5
zendesk replaced our legacy ticket system which was clunky and not cloudbased with zendesk being in the cloud we can access customer information ticket details etc from wherever we are perhaps most importantly it permitted customers to give direct feedback as soon as a ticket is marked closed this has been an invaluable tool for us in evaluating whether were providing topnotch support,5
thanks to zendesk now everything is optimized and well organized we can offer more productive and professional services to our customers,4
proszendesk has always been one of the goto solutions for helpdesk software but theyve really streamlined their system over the last few years its simple and easy to use with straightforward options for even those who are new to using a helpdesk systemzendesk is basically an email support system where all emails sent will be routed to your zendesk dashboard and show up as support tickets tickets are tagged with its own id and even crossreferenced to see if a particular sender has submitted any tickets prior so its easy to check through the support history there are also predefined responses allowing for quick and easy replies for typical queriesof course these are actually what you might believe every helpdesk system should provide but youll be surprised at how much you have to pay and that some dont even have these options at all zendesk is actually very affordable and is easily scalable,5
supervisors in our organization value zendesks reporting and analytics capabilities which allow them to evaluate team performance and the quality of customer service they can also use call recordings and analytics to improve agent trainingit administrators appreciate zendesks scalability and integration capabilities allowing them to customize the platform to their business needs they also value the security and access management of the platform customers and end users can experience an improvement in the quality of customer service when interacting with companies that use zendesk they can receive faster and more accurate answers to their questions,5
our overall experience with zendesk suite was very pleasant we have established a successful customer success team now we are working to maintain the quality of our service,5
i would say so soyes it is a great customer support ticket platform and it allows a lot of customization however that can be quite overwhelming and requires a lot of reading and digging into things to figure out how stuff worksso it is definitely not as easy to use as others that are just selfexplanatorynow the pricing structure is super super confusing and the most annoying is that they seem to just change the prices and remove features from the plan without notificationssuddenly our ability to use the fb chat integration was gone and only after countless messages forth and back with zendesk support they told us that this feature is not available in our plan anymore and that we should upgradezendesk just changed their plan names and now charges doubleso within years of using it we should already pay double the price for the same services does not make sense,4
we started using zendesk around and found it to be a great way to prioritize customer needs and make sure we are properly taking care of our clientsi really feel like it just makes the support experience better and easier for a business owner and cant imagine not having zendeskthe majority of tech companies that we deal with also use zendesk and as someone sitting on the other side for those interactions theyre easy to deal with as well,5
easy implementationgradually expanded to other featuresstill need better tracking,4
overall zendesk is an indispensable part of our company it has increased our productivity and customer satisfaction,4
integration with multiple other applicationstracking of casesgreat search history,5
it has its ups and downs but in general it is working quite nicely and the topics that can be complained about are usually not a deal breaker,3
easy to use tracks all issues and provides reports improves efficiency and service qualityi love a ticketing system and the cost of zendesk is just right the functions are endless even for the basic subscriptioneasy tool to use great customer support it is an easy way to build a helpdeskknowledgebase system for our clients to rely onquick set up easy to begin the process of setting up a help desk system nearly immediate results for customer notifications and for internal email notifications,4
overall i was very satisfied when we first started with them but every year i have found more experiences that were negativemoving away from them will take a long time but i am not happy with their service at the moment,3
an absolute waste of time trying to implement these services into my companies i dont even know where to start but its evident the developer team behind the service does very little to maintain scripts and codebases used within their apps as it is next to impossible to easily incorporate anything into your existing webspacesi have been working on implementing their services for over hours now when i was able to complete the same plus more on zoho in half that time i understand for the last time why i have not will not and do not ever want to entertain using their services ever againseems as if they tout the fact they are leading customer service solution provider but i think they are confusing the services they provide for others vs users needing support from them because if it was the ladder it would totally make senseif their dismally written and executed docs dont help you they wont then you can look forward to chatting with their dumb bot that forces you to go through min of prescreening before even routing your support request which once received will only be responded too ever min and if its a ticket expect a response after hoursnot sure how this company stay on top other than the fact they offer solicited reviews in exchange for more time but as a social media influencer i will be sure to make sure as many people stay away from this company as they can,1
proseasiness to implement and use onboarding teams with it its very simple and it saves a lot of cost by not spending so much time in this point of any customer service training,4
i use it to record issues with customers such as document problems or quality of service issues i use it to search for issues that my colleagues have dealt with in case i end up having to deal with a followup i use it to call customers frequently i use it to email customers with important information i use it to coordinate dealing with issues with my colleagues its a great app its intuitve and easy to use,5
i have had several smooth years using zendesk and really love using it for every ticket incident i have to resolve,5
a good tool to communicate with the customers and also internal communication in contact center,4
we cannot imagine our support teams without zendesk customer requests are quickly delegated between our front office technical support teams and marketing outreach teamsand an agent can easily look up message history to view past conversations with other agents it helps our teams maintain the personalization that our clients need while quickly solving their questions or help requests the best part our customers feel genuinely supported and heard,5
excellent experience,5
prosit is an awesome product and easy to train people to work on,3
greatwe have been pleased by the majority ofzd features,5
zendesk tackled all requirements for us when starting with it we were on the lookout for easy to use software that would allow ticket management as well as a help portal for our customers we required little assistance to get it set up,5
overall zendesk suite is a powerful and comprehensive customer support solution that offers a range of valuable features and benefits while it may be more expensive than some other options on the market its customizability integration capabilities and analytics make it a worthwhile investment for businesses looking to improve their customer support processes,5
i have found all the features and options on zendesk to be extremely valuable and i trust that they have been thoroughly researched and based on user feedback before being included at this time i cannot think of any additional features that are needed,5
zendesk has helped us reduce the ticket closure tat by the customer satisfaction has improved drastically with the help of interactive data reporting on zendesk we are also able to take preventive measures to reduce tickets,5
i couldnt be any happier with zendesk from the different filtering viewing admin options and more i totally feel good with this tool distributing tickets and following up with our customers has never been so easy i love how new tickets are under an unassigned folder which then can be assigned to or grabbed by anyone in the team if a customer replies it goes back to the person who initially responded the ticket which allows us to provide continuous followup another of my favorite options private comments it has helped us to save important information from the ticketcustomer without having to use other tools,5
zendesk allows me to track the type of support requests that come in from our clients and also gives me hard numbers of inquiries to support detailed information we need for progression reports,5
from the demo onboarding and implementation the zendesk team was greatbuilding out our knowledge base including written faqs videos links all work exceptionally well,5
i am satisfied with the zendesk tool through the entire system our company is able to quickly and flexibly meet demands in internal communication and customer support,5
if you want to be a pro in providing customer supportyou should work with zendesk suite and make it easier for your customers,4
i use zendesk as an inhouse it helpdesk instead of having employees line up at my door needing help they know theres a resource zendesk they can use to find answers that commonly come up during their work day its easy for them to communicate with me and my agents for other issues and for agents to seamlessly transfer tickets and have internal communication on issues,5
my overall experience with zendesk suite as a user for almost years is excellent in email and chat channels however it needs upgrades for a better user and customer experience,4
were more than happy with zendesk as our main customer support software we have a team of support personnel altogether that mainly work with email and phone support it logs activities automatically and sends them to our crm with close to no issues its also got good performance and great uptime and a good number of automation and customization options great tool overall,5
i can live chat with a potential client and propose the product or option and make frequent sales i receive notifications in real time and respond without having to stare at my pc screen,5
we use zendesk to handle customer requests across several brands and platforms from email to social media whatsapp and website chat it makes consolidating knowledge easy and enables agents to provide standardised consistent responses while still personalising them to the users unique circumstances,5
if youre using it for one single landing page or a very specific purpose zendesk chat is great for that but if you want a chat software that does a lot of different things like customer support on one page sales on another and tech help on another its really hard to do without a developer at the price we are paying zendesk chat is becoming long in the tooth and were still waiting on another chat software to change our minds,4
zendesk has allowed our support team to scale their productivity exponentially and also given us visibility on a multitude of metrics we hadnt previously considered employee productivity clients with frequent issues what issues are frequently reported etc that have changed and really amplified what we offer and how we offer it very happy,4
customer support replies quick so that helps but sometimes the lack of knowledge and training can be a little frustrating,5
the ticketing system and chat have been a great addition to our website it allowed us to provide our clients with another way to communicate with customer service when they have questions it was very easy to install on our website and it is very easy for new employees to understand the software so training is minimal,5
zendesk is the cs tool which helps users reach out to us and is a good tool to generate reports segregate users improve users experience in reaching out to support team,4
i love zendeski suggest it to everyone to useits not robust like salesforce but worth the investment,5
overall it has worked pretty wellon the user end its been marginally better than front but the reporting and integration functions have been betterits way better than using a regular email program like outlook,4
the most flexible ticket system accessible zendesk does have a plethora of options that can assist with automation furthermore you can add applications that might be helpful,5
zendesk provides a great platform for supporting your business needs when it comes to service and support,5
one of the standout features of zendesk suite is its ability to centralize customer support activities the integrated ticketing system in zendesk support allows teams to manage customer queries seamlessly this system coupled with automation features and customizable workflows contributes to a streamlined process for issue resolution the multichannel support capabilities including email chat phone and social media enable businesses to engage with customers across various touchpoints that is why my overall experience with zendesk is very good,5
prosa complete customer support solution it has everything you need for a great customer support it can be integrated with easy with most crms integrating zendesk with a chat bot and really helps sorting the ticketscustomers for a easy resolve of any issue,5
it really changed how we deal with technical issues it created a quick easy and organized way for tickets to be submitted addressed and cleared we also is at a faq and wiki which contains trouble shooting tipsadvice along with other forms of self help so for us zendesk even helps our employees handle personal issues at times freeing the help desk up to handle more difficult matters,5
overall zendesk is a easy going and pleasant tool for working and administrating we had the excellent feedback from the operatives and they are satisfied with our selection,5
we have zendesk deployed in our firm for internal support and even we do deploy and manage this tool for our clients as well the deployment of this tool is also super fast and customer support is also very good online community for this platform is very exhaustive as well therefore one can easily find solutions in case ran into problems,5
ha sido un antes y un después el poder unificar el punto de entrada de solicitues de soporte en un único software y dejar atrás el correo electrónico,5
an amazing experience for sure i started off with this helpdesk and immediately grasped how to use it to my advantage i was able to check the teams overall performance at a glance using the reporting feature we could set up responses for common scenarios which made the agents life a bit easier and improved output,5
prosi started with zendesk reluctantly because i wasnt to thrilled about their design and some features that are a little bit less than obvious but once you get a hang of it its a total life saveri got a first year free for my startup thanks to goco thanks a bunch and ive been using it ever since im a huge fan of integrating stuff and once again i was able to easily integrate zendesk using their api into my consoles and keep track of whats what and whos who i know at a quick glance whos responsible for what task and whos doing what paired with asana this is the perfect work environment,5
overall zendesk has been great and a good upgrade from what we were using previously,5
prosconfiguration is pretty easy to set up without a lot of programming to get things working the way you want,5
proszendesk does a great job at constantly improving their product listening to their customers and releasing new features to make their customers jobs easier and better from their basic ticketing support to live chat talk and even guides they really have it all under one roof they have good tutorials and a pretty active community to get help from if you need it,5
mixed bagwe definitely have a love hate relationship with this software,4
prosi love that there is an app so i can keep up with my support duties even when on the go i like being able to report on tickets based on the client to see who needs the most support this helps us know how we might improve our training being able to set our own types is very helpful generic types just wouldnt do us much good you can create macros for those tickets that can be answered with a standard email also we have it set to respond to the client after a certain number of days if the ticket is pending that prompts the client to reply and keeps us from having to wade through pending tickets manually and email the client there is a lot more than i can learn about using the product which is also a plus i have never used the help feature myself so i cannot really rate thatmy coworker has been pleased though,5
overall experience has been good very happy for the product and how it helps us stay organized with the tickets we have coming in,4
i had a positive expensive working with zendesk i set up the support center portals using their customizable templates and found that they worked well for us and our customers the zendesk support team were helpful when we needed to contact them too,4
prosif you are looking for better and alternate ticket system then zendesk is the best you can easily setup macros and triggers apply tags to tickets which helps you filter out the tickets you can rout tickets and set automated responses and follow up replies zendesk provides you better reporting than other ticketing systems you can setup your own domain to hide zendesk urls,5
zendesk has been a great help in two specific areas solving problems and getting feedback when problems arent solved satisfaction surveys its been nice to see metrics each month to find out where we can improve,5
overall my experience with zendesk is very pleasant i can keep track of all issues questions tasks andor discrepancies with ease mostly i find myself looking through past tickets as a refresher to how much my company has overcome and the improvements made as a result,5
i think it provides incredible power for crossteam collaboration within an organization and makes clientfacing communication a breeze some of the functionality can seem a bit clunky nonintuitive when learning the system but with thorough training and time these can be overcome,4
fijn programma in gebruik en makkelijk te implementeren,4
zendesk is designed as a solution of customerdirected support tickets which facilitates users to send tickets for the service request zendesk is proactive it can integrate a large number of communication channels it facilitates the communication of the company with its clients by integrating all communication channels it has been reduced by customer service work thanks to zendesk,5

we have based our entire support process on zendesk and have gotten excellent results it allows for efficient tracking of the new tickets and their progress and integrates with jira so that we can track any required development work we can also track how many tickets an agent has solved and the customers satisfaction for each one which is very useful for internal evaluation processes,5

je suis très satisfaite de lutilisation de ce logiciel vu que ça ma aider dans mon travail,5
overall it is a powerful tool and in my opinion the industry standard for customer service at one point we had tried to switch to intercom and it was awful,4
overall zendesk has has helped our company tremendously we have reduced out customer service handle time by giving the agents access to quick answers which allows them to help customers seamlessly,5
my experience with zendesk was great the customer service was excellent and they were able to help me with any questions i had the process was easy and userfriendly i would definitely recommend zendesk to others,4
running multi tiered support org with lots of agents and escalation pathsintegration with jira,4
we used to use a free it support system zendesk has dramatically changed how we approach it support the set and forget mentality that is zendesk we used to deal with disorganization and random people stopping us in the hallway this would result in us forgetting to address the issue and add further frustration for our end users zendesk is so easy to administer and even easier for our end users to put tickets in,5
we use zendesk as an email platform to communicate with our users also via phone and we also use it as a platform for our faqs and help center,5
we needed an easy to use ticketing system for our it team and zendesk has proven to be an excellent choice for us,5
proszendesk has reached a point of product maturity and mass adoption that few competitors can match not only is the software highly refined for its purpose but millions of customer service reps across the world are already familiar and wellversed with the features within some of the biggest companies in the world use zendesk for millions of tickets and instances per year as a customer youve likely used zendesk many times without even knowing it zendesk is a cornerstone for preventing customer churnattrition keeping customer sentiment positive and addressingongoing customer support needs given the reasonable licensing fees i wouldnt use anything else,5
prosthis is a great customer service tool to effectively address customer concerns our company published annual feedback of the products we are using for last years and zendesk was in the first zendesk introduced the smart ticket changed the old method of answering to tickets by assigning to people manually based on the priority but zendesk does prioritizing the tickets automatically history of the supporting agents and the customers will be updated just every hour and the feedback details can be hidden from the support agent to stay confidential integration is possible to almost all the products we use at work,4
overall i enjoy using zendeskits a great way to interact with your customers and i wouldnt hesitate to recommend it as an option,4
prosbeing able to be contacted fast by your customers and resolve different issues for them is very important for every business the interactive chat and support system from zendesk suite keeps all you tickets and customer problems organized and easy solvable great software and great support,5
i dont find any problem with using zendesk as im still using it until now it also really helps a lot in our internal communication processes as well not only with dealing customers concerns its a super crm tool i can say,5
proszendesk offers a easytouse and complete feature set for customer support and external documentation all of which is maintainable by nontechnical people,5
really practical it even has a mobile app that is very good on the go easy to use and straight forward,5
over all the experience is very good but some improvement can be done by the team,5
overall i can say zendesk is a good professional and intuitive platform that makes online customer service experience easier and more seamless from the interface to the features and functions,5
ive been working with zendesk for years now in my lob we use it to reply to emails and track escalations it has all the tools that we need to track the escalations and solve emails since we handle different company we have the option to filter this information one of my favorite features is that we can assign emails to specific people the filtering process its also nice because it helps getting the information needed faster the way we have it setup is that we have different ways to see the companies we work with the amount of pending emails and the amount of responses having all those reports help us when informing our coworkers about their progress,5
as a leader of a remote insurance telesales team i run into my fair share of it related issues to work through with my agents i also run into system errors of my own to find solutions for when i am unable to troubleshoot on my own or for my team directing them to submit an it ticket using the simple system with zendesk makes my life and theirs so much easier i use this application daily and have never run into an issue nor has my team,5
i have realized after using zendeskchatthat there was a lot of things and good opportunitys i had missed by not knowing the information that zendesk chat providesi feel more confident in my business and i am making my costumers happier by understanding there needs faster an being able to provide the best possible service i can for my clients,4
solid stars for performance,5
proszendesk makes it easy to receive track monitor and action on tickets incidents data is presented in a clear and logical manner which allows you to focus on closing the ticket instead of manipulating the software,5
in het algemeen is zendesk het beste platform voor tickets en alle soorten van contact,5
with zendesk we centralised our ticket management and enabled a steady inflow of new tasks coming from our clients and managers before they head the development portion of the team,4
zendesk has helped us automate processes and respond faster to client requests its detailed information has helped us improve operations,5
fantastic the company i work for moved from a local ticketing system to this cloud based service and it was a game changer,4
i think zendesk is a great solution for things like customer support with a lot of different options to fit your needs such as a social media tool as well i highly recommend it,5
overall experience is goodtool is helpful and relatively easy to use,5

nous utilisons ces informations pour développer de nouveaux services et améliorer le service client nous avons considérablement augmenté la production et maintenant tout est clair cest incroyable la liberté que nous donnons à nos clients avec une bibliothèque dautoassistance nous avons créé un service dassistance de style copenhague mais nous ladorons avec les styles css,4
the only reason i am using zendesk is because it is integraded and my entire ticket history is in zendesk i am just hoping i do not need any support in the future because it will take so much time and frustration it is just not worth it,4
proshaving used zendesk as an alternative to other options here are my thoughts on it zendesk is good at integrating multiple communication channels into one place unlike other options using social media channels is included in the cost with zendesk the social media channels are included in the per user cost so you are only paying for other features like knowledgebase or live chat or the bundled option cost per user is fairly reasonable compared to other solutions we looked at for us the cost per user was really important because while we may need fancy features we wanted to make sure we did not end up spending more money for features or services we really didnt need third party app support we were able to choose and integrate with third party tools using the app directory this helps to add functionality that may not be included in the core zendesk product,4
we are using zendesk to help people better communicate issues with the software and hardware they use our manager likes to be able to have a report of most popular issues and number of support requests,5
im using zendesk since months,5
from to our company has been used zendesk for your customer service solution via the technical support team we used to manage assign and distribute all knids of issues via zendesk which really amazing tool and really saved our valuable time and make faster our regular scheduled working hour and increased productvity i love zendekand their smart service including lovely customer support,4
this app works fine for most needshowever it gets very costly as you add components,3
it has really made our support system better the internal workflows have been improved drastically so we are closing tickets more reliably and quicker if you are looking for a help desk solution i would recommend you give zendesk a look,5
prosall my experiences with the zendesk was extremely positive they really make it easy to run a help desk,5
overall average would have been above average if not for the pricing,4
i am really happy since using zendesk i actually look forward to getting support ticketsi develop sell software to consumers i use support techs who work out of their home its not always easy bringing them up to speed on some of the more complex technical issueswe used to use straight email i did not get to see what my employees were telling customers so i couldnt monitor the quality of service and give the employees training when required now i can see what they are saying and i can jump in and assist in some of the more complex caseswhen i answer support tickets i am more motivated to give detailed answers because i can refer my employees to my replies and they can learnnow that we all share access to the pool of support tickets we can give more prompt replies and customers get faster service customers are much more forgiving when they see answers in minutes instead of hours or days when a customer is thinking of buying and sends us a question he is more likely to buy if the answer comes back in minutes and he is still in a buying frame of mindi love being able to tell at a glance the status of all our outstanding support issuesthe markdown codes enable us to use typographic features to better lay out out replies making them clearer and more easy to understandi like the email format that zendeskuses it is the most natural and convenient way to communicate with customers i like that customers dont have to sign into a ticket management app if they dont want towe tried using a support forum so that customers could get access to all past support answers that did not work out as some disgruntled customers left nasty and overly negative comments for all to see which would discourage prospective customersi am going to tell all my software developer colleagues about zendesknow if you could add tables to the markdown code zendesk would be beyond perfect,5
overall this was a great management platform we discontinued because it did not have an upsell feature and wasnt very friendly to multiple users id say its perfect for a start up with with only one or two agents,5
my experience with zendesk has been good all our requirements were met the product is priced on the higher side and there are some cheaper solutions available in the market,4
it solved a lot of business problems for our team we were able to connect our phone lines to zendesk so every time a customer would call the system would automatically create a ticket for us it allowed us to respond very quickly to our customers since we were able to download zendesk to all of our devices,5
helps everyone focus on the work instead of the work order creation process or any other oddities in the work flow that is created by alternative ticketing softwares,5
in all zendesk is a great platform to service customers both internal and external while i have gripes like the above mentioned missing forwarding i like that the controls are abundant enough to allow for workarounds to be put in place this level of control has also lead to some really creative efficiencies produced by my team,4
its an upgrade over our previous toolthe features it provides allow us to have better control of the emails and the response time to our customers,4
overall zendesk delivers a seamless experience for end customers,4
prosgreat ticketing system for customer service and technical support,5
zendesk chats allow us to address customer queries while on the website which allow us to help customer to finalize a purchase that otherwise would be lost it is also useful to rise customer satisfaction as customers do not have to wait on the telephone or write emails to receive an answer,5
i have had experience with zendesk both as someone who opens support tickets and the one who responds to them and now as a frequent user of the application i understand how precise the work goes into support management and how incredibly the platform helps the workflow of its users,5
prostriggers views automations and the easyness to integrate with other platforms,5
prosthis tool works as a great ticket management system you can link an email address that you set as your support address and any email received will automatically generate a support ticket on it from there the support team can either reply straight away or assign the ticket to any other member team that would be able to reply to ittickets can be marked in the platform as open which is the status that they will automatically have when a new message is received as pending when you post a reply to it or acknowledge it or as closed when the ticket is resolvedthe platform also provides statistics on how your support team is performing so that you can see reports based on the average first reply time or the satisfaction rating from users,4
not bad but i would recommend freshdesk over zendesk because they offer many features in comparison with zendesk pricing,4
proszendesk has allowed our team to manage all communications externally and internally within a single softwarewith different users and teams setup you control who sees what tickets and allows us to direct customers queries to the correct personteam and provide a continuous trail so at any time somebody can see the history behind a specific inquirypersonally i use it for complaint management which allows me to see the interactions between sales and the customer any photosattachments and provide an internal communication with sales for any input or analysis,5
overall this software has been beneficial for us but there may be better less expensive options out there for small businesses if you have a medium or large business zendesk could bring a lot of value to your business,5
een fijn programma om mee te werken vooral door de overzichtelijkheid,5
overall to me theres no doubt of recommending zendesk suiteit makes my life that much easier when it comes to supporting our clientsbecause of this tool our support is one of the most mentioned positive topics when it comes to rating our company,5
we were using it track calls made to our support organization and to track tickets created through other softwares we pushed it into salesforce,4
served us incredibly well for years the macros and autoresponders cut down a lot of work for our cs team it allowed us to add a costeffectivepersonalised voice mail call recording and a comprehensive help desk to support our customers,5
proszendesks support site is really robust so if something isnt customized right out of the box the way you want itzendesk has various automations you can set macros which is text you frequently send and theyve slowly incorporated lots of support related channels so ensure you can represent your customers preferences through chat talk or emailthey have features like answer bot to try to push ai to decrease customer reliance on your customer support agentsi like that as an admin i can know nothing but pretty quickly put together a robust customer support solution,5
overall zendesk is easy to use once you get the hang of itcompared to other popular help desk ticketing solutions zendesk has more to offer in the way data is stored and accessed and in reporting,5
the overall experience has been really positive zendesk is very user friendly both for our team and our customers in addition we are able to track useful data and trends we can use to focus our support efforts,5
ferramenta completa para quem esta começando e com muitas opções para o crescimento junto com sua equipe,5
zendesk email chat make my job a breeze because before i had to wake on another person to get back to me about the lawyer or customer response now it is just me doing all of it myself thanks to this software,5
overall the zendesk chat software has helped boost the communication between our business and our customers we like that we can supply answers right away to people although it can be a little time consuming if you receive a lot of chats during offbusiness hours the history of visitors is helpful though if you miss and chat and still need to get in contact with the customer i dont know if there are any better chat apps out there but if not this is a pretty good solution,5
we have increased production on the helpdesk and have been able to provide better customer service with zendesk it allows for more detail to be placed in the tickets as it is worked on and keeps all of the users involved up to date on the status,5
zendesk gives us a way to manage multiple projects and also an interface thats easy for clients to use,4
prosit is best in class period i did a ton of research when selecting our new ticketing platform go live was generally uneventful and easy the process of creating and standing up everything as well as internal testing took a month i really came to zendesk for its analytics and its ability to expand with tons of app integrationsthe analytics really allow me to dive into valuable buisness metrics such as time to first response total time spent per client per month resolutions times tagging i could go on and on,5
prosi used the software to manager mostly customer service emails the amount of functions available to the user was great lead tracking company website integration and ticket sorting were helpful,4
proszendesk makes it really easy to organize all requests you receive from your inhouse team to outside customers our team receives hundreds of tickets a week since we receive so many tickets the best features zendesk has to counter this are triggers automations and macros with triggers your able to automate activities to happen based on certain criteria for example if a ticket gets submitted with the word help in the subject line you can program zendesk to assign it to a specific person and to reply to the submitter with a message automations function in a similar way but are timed instead of instantaneous macros allow you to update a tickets tags message and other information with a click of a button zendesk has done a great job to make a ticketing system that increases company efficiency it also has a help desk customer forum qa section that is available at a specific price tier that could save you time,5
for all my frustration with zendesk the reporting is great the guys upstairs will love it im just really unclear why zd doesnt seem to care about their actual users im guessing the answer is that users dont pay the bills the people printing the reports dosome alternatives to consider are help scout uv desk or fresh desk which are all better uiwise but have worse reporting youll need to pick your poison,3
prosthe user interface is very convenient to use both for support agents as well as customersthe prices are also quite affordable as well,5
its being used daily by our support team to track tickets coming from our customer best for bb setting,5
we regularly use zendesk for all my clients customer support needs no other platform comes close to it,5

proszero pros the worst experience of any ticketing software and customer support have been trying to cancel for months and keep getting the runaround,1
pros gives the user customer support guy a complete outlook of and information about a support ticket created can also track the ticket details as in who it was assigned to assigned date assignee where did the ticket origin from support people are awesome too have had no issues which they couldnt fix till date but also didnt have many issues the chatting system is incredible the huge bubble of active users the details of the users which are chatting with you in realtime multiple ways to reach them back if you cannot take the chat currently is pretty good too we havent even started working on its api yet from the looks of it it seems really good and interesting,5
i have used zendesk at a formal office job for almost two years and it was very stable and very convenient to use as a hub to handle all the online requests including social media at a single place most softwares usually require days or weeks of training but zendesk was very easy to use,5
proseasy to create documentation and manage documentationwe can easily automate stuff with triggers and automationsfully customizable forms labels tags etcmacros are time savers,4
estamos encantados con la herramienta nos ha ayudado a optimizar muchísimo nuestra atención al cliente,5
i still use zendesk daily it is fantastic to mage a largeumber of clients it allows me to keep track by setting tasks on clients and deals it allows me to create multiple deals per client which is also very useful highly recommend,5
there are several fantastic time features like tags macros and triggers i used the zendesk api extensively in my reporting and found it to be very userfriendly overall zendesk is a solid product,5
overall zendesk is best for cloud customer support as it supports email updates to customers and it has also a customer view facility it also helps to engage customers but there are also some cons of zendesk as there is no customer support at all and its pricing is also too high,5
definitely a learning curve when getting setup but it becomes pretty powerful once you learn the functionality available,4
prosi like the ease of use with zendesk suiteive tried many other options and the layout for zendesk suite fits the best and is very easy to work with,5
if you want solution you can deploy tomorrow and get it working from day zendesk is great to go with dont wish for too much when it comes to advance features,4
definetely this tool helped us to save time when dealing with customers requests,5
i would definitely recommend zendesk when it comes to a ticket system for around people but once you exceed around that amount andor want very detailed reporting goals statistics trends etc i would recommend a more intricate ticket system,4
counting days till our subscription expires after that there is no chance in hell i would proceed with the softwareterrible customer support who does not give a single damn about level crirical problemsweve switched our subscription to monthly billing and they were happy to charge a monthly fee however right after that they attempted to charge our subscription the same one with an annual payment we used to have before the change i mean its ok there are issues in software an all but ive reported the issue to them and very quickly got an answerim going to go ahead and send this ticket over to our finance ops team someone from their team will be reaching out soonfive business days passed i reached out to them four times they promised to escalate the issue and guess what they attempted to charge the card for the annual payment for the third time no answer to my ticket meantimeso the overall impression is run from zendesk as fast as you can luckily there are a plethora of similar solutions out there,2
it provides quality ticket management solutions with good reporting and integration highly recommend it,5
as i have said earlier this is a musthave software for a great customer service experience,5
support consumers and channel partners via omnichannel contact center software we replaced the system with dixa zendesk turned off phone support and some of the csrs i got via chat had no idea what they were doing,2
prosit comes with great live chat features and makes a great help desk solutionin addition i like the knowledge base features and the fact that it makes customer service easy,5
overall it is a very positive experience and the software is highly recommended as well as being costeffective,4

we have moved our complaints and daily customer service workflows into the system to provide better visibility within the company multisite and to streamline our processes in order to reduce time to respond to the customer paper and time spent accomplishing tasks,5
monitoring tickets activity and agent reports are easy to navigate theres a delay from time to time but that didnt lessen the experience we had and i can vouch that its a good system to use for sourcing and outsourcing data everywhere,5
overall it was a good experience they are a big company so the service can be a little bit flaky my am was not even aware of me,4
my overall experience has been highly positive this software wasinstrumental in keeping our business afloat during the heights of the pandemic although we are back inperson we continue to rely on zendesk for efficient resolution of customer and potential customer issues and inquiries,5

i utilize zendesk as a consumer regularly in chatting and shopping with online copaints such as lensabl for example the process of communication was smooth and effective and i chose the option to have the chat mailed to my email therefore i have all of the details without the necessity to ask again or become confused it was a good experience only slower than speaking requiring patience,5

since the product acquisition the support team helped us in every step of the integration our last update was to set up a middleware app to route whatsapp facebook and twitter request and turn them into tickets,5
prosessendo il nostro prodotto creato totalmente in house per anni abbiamo utilizzato un sistema di assistenza clienti nativo della nostra piattaforma man mano che i clienti hanno iniziato ad aumentare è diventato difficile riuscire a gestire il flusso di richieste che arrivavano allassistenza clienti abbiamo deciso quindi di installare zendesk non solo abbiamo ridotto le tempistiche di risoluzione dei nostri casi ma abbiamo anche migliorato la customer experience andando ad aumentare retention rate dei nostri clienti decisamente un ottimo prodotto se cercate una soluzione per lassistenza clienti,5
proszendesk is reliable and very intuitive it has a lot of integration that simplify your work if you are using a lot of tools with your business,4
zendesk makes our support team more efficient and organized it also creates accountability in this department this accountability enables me to have insight into the work my team is doing as well as provide detailed reports to our customers as needed,4
prosits good features have in zendesk to manage our customers issue through zendesk and resolve over the system,4
awesome functionality high price,4
i can say overtime you can get used to it so it can be nice but i personally dislike the platform,4
its the best,4
i loved using this software and we have used this software for quite long time and still i cannot forget how easy and nice it was to handle,5
prosive been using zendesk for over four years for the first two years we used it as an it helpdesk we were able to assign tickets to colleagues categorize with type and prioritize with slas we now use this platform in collaboration with another company but from a customers perspective i find it easy to raise tickets as well as looking at any pendingopen tickets i have i also like the fact i can search by the organization and see other tickets my colleagues have raised,5
it has a great polished ui wonderful implementation of real world customer support interfaces and very easy to learn zendesk proves to be one giant in the customer support industry and any business should be able to utilize this software with easeif youre looking for a robust cs program that can manage all your customers queries and at the same time make it easier for your agents to solve problems for the customers zendesk should be your first choice,4
its feature set is not as complete as salesforce but if you do not need much automation for tickets and just have a small team working on tickets zendesk works great without much customization needed,4
overall zendesk suite is a topnotch platform for customer service we can manage consumer relations fast and effectively thanks to its simplicity of use and breadth of functionality using zendesk as our primary tool software was the most amazing experience ive ever had because of zendesk the workload was times simpler and lighter,5
my account executive has been pretty good to deal with which is nice,5
pretty good ticketing software but not my top choice probably top i have ever used,3
as costumer service agent it help us a lot when assisting our costumers through email it is easy to utilize and very convenient however in the past few days we encounter some problem that our costumer may not received emails from us even we already resolved and email them back up until now not every time but sometimes so i hope it you can fix it immediately but again my whole experience in zendesk was superb,5
overall our experience with zendesk is good the system does what it needs to do i do feel like there are not many changes coming into effect while there are many things still to be developed for example sending new tickets to clients look like they get a response on an open ticket which doesnt make much sense this has been reported many times over the years but the issue remains,3
i can confidently say that zendesk is the best in its business nothing comes even closer recommended,5
i love how easy it is to extract the reports the function it has the many integrations we can make it also offers chat support the platform is easy to use and there are many options for customer service the numerous integrations that exist facilitate the work with the other products that a company has,5
the worst company ever because their trial system is so limited i decided to pay for a subscription could not for the life of me get it up and running properly then i asked to cancel and have a refund they continued to ticket my request then mnts later send me a document showing they do no refunds what a horrible company i use agile a way better system as is phoneburner do not use zendesk,1
i use zendesk when i seasonally work as a csr for an online company during their periodic launchesi dont have to relearn it each time which is nice i like the ease of finding past tickets not a fan of the chat feature,4
we used zendesk to receive technical support questions by clients and to follow up on these with multiple colleagues,4
its fine but it feels incomplete its been around for a long time and i feel like they havent made many improvements,3
pretty good most platforms like this usually have little tweaks that need to be made but this is managed centrally which is a benefit,3
zendesk made the task of communications with customers and solving their issues a breeze if thats what you need to do then i recommend them,5
pretty postivie its a great tool for customer care and the conexion with facebook and twitter allows for a complete ownership of the customer care attention,4
prosit was my pleasure to work with zendesk software i even help them to translate to bulgarian version one of the most important thing for customer service software is the ability to searching and finding information for the person you are serving at the time of communication it is crucial when this communication is over the phone thanks to their outstanding ux support agents are capable to find everything related with the person in no time integrations with rd party apps are essential but not so important the thing is why these apps are paid why why i need to move to the upper level of my subscription to use a specific integration there is no sense,4
every successful customer relationship begins with a positive customer experience and that is what zendesk offers to everyonekeep rockin,5
my experience so far has been great and i believe it will be better as time goes by,5
overall my experience with zendesk and their application was wonderful in fact it started getting better and kept getting better from the beginning when i first purchased it years ago but the price has just gone up too much the services havent gotten any better and i just feel like the price needs to if anything go down especially with all these new similar applications coming out,5
overall the zendesk platform meets and exceeds the needs of our business it has helped us streamline our customer support processes and improved overall customer experience,4
overall it is not a bad ticketing softwareit shows its flaws in busier environments where more users are involved and program support needs specialization or customization for a small business with minimal issues requiring base line support this would be a good recommended option,4
for ease of use it definitely provides crossteam functionality that i found pretty easy to understand and share with junior team members to implement it from home base when i worked for a reit out to hundreds of marketing teams on our properties that was a little more difficult to be honest there was a learning curve for that,4
prosease of use with remote working was a critical requirementability to have telephony and crm integrated under one platform in a cost effective solution,5
prosi run and manage our zendesk its pretty solid tool with alot of great functions and tool use to make your help desk hum along the support page is nice to direct users to there for help or solutionssupport is helpful and usually responds pretty quickly i enjoy all the features and ease of setting up and removing users as well,4
prosthe way it integrates with other platforms the notifications speed and its reporting capabilities,5
zendesk allowed me to follow the evolution of my business and to learn how to quickly manage my requests tickets,4
prosif ever there was a more aptly named product i havent seen itprior to implementing zendesk my client support was done exclusively through email and it was a terrible customer experience once i had my hands on zendesk my client satisfaction scores went up i was able to create track and manage my client cases at a much higher levelits responsive easy to use and most importantly efficientyou cannot go wrong in implementing this into you business,5
prossoftware is easy to use intuitive and its clean design makes supporting all day a lot easier,5
i think i sum it up in my pro category box i can put my questions or needs out to my clientscasting directorsmarket research teamsand so much more while trusting in the relay of internal messages and support many who dont look would be surprisedi bet to see that zendesk handles so many life related communication needs on both sides of the fence a truly easier approach when having to speak directly voice to voice for servicing is not necessary or conduciveto the concern,5
it has been great i was looking for a very simple tool to deal with it issues without having to clog up my outlook inbox and this has been fantastic at a low price point im able to have all my tickets in a system that shows me all the notes between i and the staff and an easy to read email sent out automatically when i respond in the system itself,4
supporting our customers has always been a struggle in the past ever since zendesk our customer experience team can focus more on solving problems than having to worry about managing the requests and keeping track of what needs to be done since requests were coming in through multiple channels now its all in one place total game changer,5
talking about live chat tools zendesk has a strong feature set which makes it suitable for any size of businesses and they are constantly adding new features especially for a better mobile experience,4
zendesk allows us to keep track of all of our customers and partners and allows for enough custom script and widgets for our teams to meet their individual goals,4
o zendesk facilita e muito na gestão de tickets da organizaçãoferramenta indispensável para empresas que precisam de um ferramenta de itsm de qualidade,5
i am personally using zendesk for years already and the company is using it for even longer i cannot imagine a better customer support platform with such an easytouse interface and tons of personal customization features,5
overall zendesk is still the best tool out there they could spend a little more time improving some of their core features instead of releasing new ones all the time but still a great tool,4
prosi use zendesk daily i have internal tickets that get addressed by it and tickets that get addressed by tech support which ultimately help with hundreds of client questions or issues its easy to comment internally and easy to view the ticket and receive email updates on where we are at,5
prosi have been using zendesk for over years and it has been fantastic it integrates well with slack and jira which are massively important to allow the support team to contact each team to raise any requests that they may have teams can view the support tickets and see a full history between the end user and the company or more specifically the support team without the need of repeating themselves over and over again,5
excellent,5
i think zendesk worked perfectly for what we needed to do in order to keep track of customer support tickets and with communicating within our team and with our customers,5
overall this has been very beneficial as far as relieving overload on our help desk and providing faster better customer service,4
im a satisfied user of zendesk but i feel a lot of features are still missing and over time i am not seeing any improvement with the platform our company may consider getting out of zendesk in the next few years as zendesk doesnt fit the analytics we need as our company grows,4
really satisfied customer problem employee problem everything can be tracked easily,4
pros easy to setup and super personalized tool create chatflows to help your customers the ai keeps getting better track tickets and assign them into multiple owners inside hubspot integration with a lot of tools and apps marketplace,5
zendesk provided a nice customer support portal for tracking all the customer issues and incidents,4
prosin an organization like ours where customers communicate with the sales team via multiple mediums it used to be very difficult to effectively track workflow with zendesk chat we have been able to create an effective customer service workflow via which we have been able to track all customer queries in real timeweb visitors chatting with our live chat team are also able to add attachments via the chat window saving precious time that would had been otherwise expended sending attachments as via emailzendesk has also enabled customers get a copy of their chat session with our sales agents in their inbox for record purposes,5
we love our helpdesk and i would recommend zendesk to anyone looking for a better way of interacting with your customers and providing enterpriselevel support away from emailwhen the cons above are developed and updated which i imagine they will be we will have an extremely robust solutioni can honestly attribute zendesk to the tool that positively changed our interactions with customersusing email managers struggle to know or understand clients needs and how effective support isand employees struggle with inbox overload and lost issues that dont get prioritized or addressed timelyzendesk improved our response times dramatically provides insights into the type of issues and questions our clients ask about and keeps us accountable to our customers feedback through integrated client surveys after tickets are solved,5
proswhether you are dealing with fewer than a hundred or over a thousand daily interactions we know we can trust zendesk to simply work it has great integration features with our existing tools different social media platforms textsms apps among otherswe can build custom templates and reports with it that allowed us to make smart and customerdriven decisions to help our brand grow,5
overall i really love to use zendesk this is a very useful tool for doing analysis on our live channels and as i mentioned reports has a great function when it comes to filtering,4
zendesk has helped us improve and measure our parents satisfaction with our communication it has also helped us stay on course of our response time goal and satisfaction level goal through the statistics it provides daily,5
prosthe versatility from both side using admin as well as agents,5
great at first but our company outgrew zendesk due to issues they just couldnt solve for us,4
prosits easy to navigate and usually stores a medium amount of complex customer data,4
our team handles phone chat and email channels providing customer support this tool provides us a seamless experience and allow us to work in a single environment the report system has always been invaluable part of our workloads as it provides us detailed report to keep on track,5
prosweve been zendesk chat for almost years now without any issuesthe free version itself gives most of the basic functionality but if your service is vast and requires multiple executives to attend to chat queries the free version may be limiting zendesk is very easy to configure on your application and very intuitive,4
ce que jai le moins apprécié dans zendesk suite cest que certaines fonctionnalités avancées telles que lintégration avec dautres outils nécessitent des abonnements à des niveaux de tarification plus élevés ce qui peut être coûteux pour les petites entreprises de plus linterface utilisateur pourrait être améliorée pour une navigation plus intuitive et une meilleure convivialité cependant malgré ces points négatifs zendesk suite reste une solution complète pour la gestion du support client,4
overall experience with zendeck was positive and i would recommend it,4
efficiency fast communication between departments,5
greater efficiency in responding to customer requests we are also able to collaborate better as a team improving internal workflows finally we are able to leverage and update help content so that our customers are served up the most relevant information,5
prostheir customer support is outstanding and willing to walk through new opportunities or problems with you,5
prosi remember when zendesk first arrived on the scene and i was in need of some helpdesk software for a new customerfacing project so i decided to see what zendesk was like i was immediately impressed with how clean the ui was and how at ease it made me feel when i viewed it as a user while i was setting up the ticket types and options i understood pretty much right away why it was called zendesk if you want a hasslefree ticketing system look no further uncomplicated issue management at its best,5
prosit has support for submitting ticketsinquiries via social media online forums and chat rooms each with plenty of customizations this allows us to tailor each channel of communication based on demographics makes it really easy to scale customer support automated email reporting features is a great for management as well,5
super recomendo pois o mesmo entrega tudo que promete e por custo flexível me permite uma melhor gestão de atendimento ao cliente com respostar mais rápida e ainda rastrear todas conversas em tempo real ou finalizadas,4
increased productivity and better handling of client support issue and needs,5
overall i highly rate this product zendesk has all the features you need for ticketing support management if there was one thing id liketo see more are nice graph visuals of the team and type of request on one central dashboard but aside from that i would recommend zendesk to many of my colleagues,5
prosit is a customer service management tool it provides a ready forum with a readily integrated customer support for your business it can be very important for your business to not only interact with the customers but for the customers to interact with each other for a better insight it also offers a free and demo trial with its basic services,4
great tool for our support needs,5
de modo geral é uma ótima opção para suporte e atendimento ao cliente te dando inúmeras possibilidades de contato podendo extrair relatórios diversos,5
prosmultiple integrations in one product powerful reporting systems,4
proszendesk suite had a variety of features chich include managing of support tickets customer base management and supports live chat its also pretty simple to use,3
in general the platform has helped me a lot in managing communication and generating tickets it would only improve the time of transfer of messages from communication channels to the platform and the breakdown of messages when you have a bot outside of that i highly recommend it to have a better control of communication in your community,4
overall zendesk is a best ticketing platform for support driven organizations its helps you to prioritize customers issues and build a strong customer relationship by acknowledging their issues,5
prosthe platform has great uptime never gives issues and is incredibly easyfast to use,5
creating and organizing support tickets based off of incoming emailsphone callsit gives you the ability to have multiple eyes on a support issue although for us there was mainly only one person handling these issuesin our case it was used to track issues see them thru to completion and track issue typesresolution times on an ongoing basis,5
once you get past the initial learning curve its a great app since we started using it we have more control with our clients and all our tickets can be resolved,4
works well for organizing customer requests for a support or development team features are very limited in the basic package and upgrading causes the costs to go up dramatically,5
prosvery userfriendly and easy to track tickets by organization,5
prosthis is a feature rich piece of software which if you have the time you can have working wonders for you and satisfying your customers beyond their wildest dreams along with tags macros and many more features and functions your responses can be sure to be consistent on voice and across the users using it,5
zendesk elminates the problem of accidentally missing a chat request or responding to that chat request in a delayed manner we route the chat messages to different people throughout the different times of the day on all their devices and they can respond even if they are on the road this is particularly important for sales questions and getting them responded by sales people we keep all chat history in our crm we can customize the chat windows as we want nothing more to want really,5
proszendesk has a lot of customization features with the ability to set so many triggers to send your customers emails and follow ups it is truly the best part about zendesk if you are in need offollowing up after a customer has reached out for support,4
having used zendesk and a few competitors i do find value in many of the efficiencies that zendesk has though it costs a little more it may be worth it for you given the more efficient common workflows for example zendesk has the ability to respond to and close a ticket in a single click something missing from many ticketing systems,4
prosits setup is easy and allows you to cover many of the inquiries and questions your customers have without creating web pages you have to update ive also used it for employees and outsourcers on long running projects to cover their questions people ask the same questions its their nature and zendesk allows you to automate the responses it also provide accountability to inquiries so you can follow up and have a trail to make sure that the inquiry was addressed and if not you can fix it,4
proszendesk does service desk really well in terms of the basic functionalities like ticket management triaging tracking and routing zendesk also offers addons for sales crm live chat support and other apps that a smb might need as it scales its operations and teams integrations with other platforms like crm marketing automation customer data platforms and messaging platforms such as slack are relatively turnkey and require little involvement from developers,4
we are now able to create an omnichannel experience for our customers,5
zendesk offers a lot of valuable features for management of multilevel contact tickets the system is very easy to explain and use very little training is needed to use this product effectively,4
all in all i liked the software it can be said that one of the best itsm solutions regarding the request fulfillment and incident management process can be awarded to this product,4
prosby now zendesk has become pretty much a standard among smaller and midsized companies when it comes to running efficient customer service weve been using it for years and every time we wandered off people turnover plansfunctionality changes etc we saw a sharp decrease in the quality of customer service,5
proszendesk was very valuable in helping our team to manage and prioritize service tickets from customers previous to using zendesk we were attempting to use a cutrate crm that really wasnt designed to management service tickets in a nimble and fast way zendesk integrated with our propriety software system we set that api up and allowed us to very closely track the concerns and complaints of our customers as well as give us the statistical insights into the quality of our customer support that we really needed,4
once everything is setup to your liking it is goodthere is no back up or sla for issuesif a ticket gets caught in a bottleneck there are no notificationsyou just have to deal,5
overall experience with zendesk is good but there is lot of improvement areas which can benefit to reduce complexity of use,4
very easy to configure providing needed multiple features extremely helpful it communication tool with the best record keeping abilities,5
prosour team has been using zendesk for awhile now since it complements our teams needs so well it has call center features which is a great addition to any customer service team since client feedbacks are also received through phone calls it can manage incidents project changes availability asset and others it is complete in a sense that is has everything a customer service team needs and more,5
proszendesk is a great email ticketing system you can create multiple boxes monitor all emails with ease answer multiples at once and easily assign work to team members based on skills languages etcit also filters out most spam and automatic replies keeping the boxes more manageableits easy to transfer emails and still answer the customer at the same time so they know youre working on their issueplus it integrated beautifully with our chat software,5
i was introduced to zendesk as part of my onboarding training despite multiple functions and features everything seemed clear and wellthought from the start i cant imagine handling emails at work without zendesk it makes the job much easier and smoother absolutely love it,5
proszendesk is basically a customerfacing web interface that has been developed to provide robust reporting and advanced analytics to businesses the software provides personalized customer support at both public and private forums you can easily export your ticket views to csv you are also offered multichannel support on email web phone chat and social media salesforce and sugarcrm are prebuilt in the software,4
overall my online consulting and coaching business made use of zendesk in order to manage customer support issues and inquiries and it worked seamlessly i was able to have a central support hub to route customer issues and have my assistant manage handling the inquiries,5
zendesk is our customer service management platform would never recommend it as a solution,3
weve been using zendesk for years it has made email communication task management extremely easy and intuitive all of out team love it,5
zendesk has been an interesting experience when i started at this company we were already using it but i have since been able to customize it more thoroughly to suit our needs as the company grows its a great customer service platform that offers omnichannel support so that we can handle all of our customer requests in one place,5
um dos problema que solucionei foi de assertividade nas entregas uma vez que antes era realizado totalmente de forma informal sendo assim não mantendo grandes controles das atividades desenvolvidas bem como os status das mesmas,5
zendesk helpdesk has streamlined the way that we track our support requests,5
proszendesk est un outil très puissant permettant de centraliser les messages clients depuis notre formulaire de contact mais également de créer une faq et même de récupérer les message depuis les boites de réception des marketplace très utile pour un pure player comme nous,5
prosdead simple to set uphours and minutes not dayswhat you get is a robust help desk some powerful automation mechanism and excellent reportingthe available addins make integrating with other systems very helpful,4
i would rate the software out of as there are a few areas that require fixing on the system however i acknowledge that there is no perfect software,5
ive been using it for a while and so far its been easy to implement and team members get used to it quickly,5
a good tool with good capabilities but you should take in mind the pricing package and users license that make this tool a very expensive one for big companies,4
this software allows me to run a helpdeskwithout it id have notepads and voicemails,5
ive used zendesk for several years and was key in its implementation into my departments ticketing process i see no need to explore other options as zendesk does everything i need and more,4
prosthis software was very easy to implement,5
working in support customer service zendesk tickets makes life so much easier in tracking and recording the solution to the problems,4
this plugin lets you manage several conversations at once so you can always be present for those site visitors who are most likely to convert with premium paid you can set up triggers that let you reach out to every visitor automatically so youre more available to hold indepth conversations with serious prospects you can use the chat system on your mobile device thanks to dedicated mobile apps and you can use the included analytics to assess how visitors use your website you can also easily customize it to reflect your sites design and color scheme,5
prosour services team and client success teams both use zendesk in slightly different ways that are equally effective services team uses it for status updates to the client on inprogress work and documenting quotes approvals client success uses it for issue tracking bugs and updates on releases both teams love having customized slas for reply clocks and customized signatures for information sharing we also use automatic replies and the ticket status options so that our teams are on the same page about where tickets are at,5
proszendesk is userfriendly and automatically creates tickets based on custom triggers you set making teams more efficient and organized it helps to ensure customer communication is handled in a timely manner and nothing falls through the cracks with a transparent paper trail of all twoway communication,4
prosit is my first software used for customer service managementcontact i do not know if there are others out there that are more expensive or cheaper or more reliable to use etc so it is a tad difficult to say what i like or dislike as comparisons are not available to me i do like the clean interface,4
zendesk makes my life easier when i am learning new products it is also makes the lives easier of my clients,5
zendesk feels user and customer friendly you profit from an accessible knowledge base but for a growing saas company we feel like there could be improvement in supporting more extensive workflows processes and itsmaspects,4
zendesk was the first ticketing software i had experience with which was perfect because it was so easy to pick up and get the hang ofbut now that ive been using it more and have become an administrator im seeing that its more capable than i had previously realized as well,4
this is the best ticket management software and it makes life easier to be able to share information or data simple and beautiful user friendly,4
it provided us with a great tool for supporting our users but the support from zendesk became lacking and so we moved on to a company that had better customer support,4
has the potential to be really good but for our day to day operations honestly it probably caused more headaches than solved,3
overall it was pretty good since the product is so featurefunction richgetting the support to understand how to best use the product was a challenge sometimes,4
prosit is very easy to implement and unlike other alternatives allows the storage of documents,5
having been on board with zendesk for over four years now we have seen a lot of improvements to the platform zendesk has helped us build our support team to what it is today i am grateful for the ease of use and functionality it provides my team their customer support is great which is expected from customer support software they have made a few updates that have enhanced the overall look and feel of the software too i enjoy using zendesk and highly recommend it,5
it was overall nice,5
this tool allows you to focus more on your customers have them closer and the attention they receive makes them happy having your customers happy means that your company is going in the right direction without a doubt a very complete and efficient tool,5
as a user loved it but on the backend side im not so sure when it worked it worked but when it didnt it seems like thats when it went off the rails,4
can help us make our work more effective and a reliable program,4
in general this is a solid product that is used by thousands of companies the only thing i wish was that some of the reporting could be more easily extracted,3
we ended up having so much feedback from clients who routinely had large file attachments that were rejected on our plan level and who wanted to use the actual portal themselves to check their ticket status that we looked into other options before upgrading we found an alternative that we switched to and saved over in cost and got all the features we wanted i think this platform was simply made to be the right fit for larger enterprises and im sure its the cream of the crop in those situations,5
prosdesde el principio todo es muy sencillo te dan tu número de teléfono tu correo tu panel personalizable y tu código para el widget luego tienes muchísimas opciones ya que es un producto muy completo al tener capacidad multicanal para ofrecer ayuda a todos tus usuarios yo consumidores,5
disgusting would never recommend and will actively switch everyone i speak to from zendesk to freshdesk,2
we significantly improved our user selfhelp experience by deploying and leveraging zendesk articles and learning paths,4
zendesk suite isnt bad suitable for those who are into customer service but may not be a strong suit for those who are into technology or highly familiar with features zendesk is best said to be beginnerfriendly,4
much better experience that freshchat i faced many problem with freshchat and zendesk just made it easier for installation and support,5
i love zendesk i have used zendesk for nearly all my clients and once you begin using it you cant go back to any other similar platforms i even use it as an internal tool in my organization,5
overall zendesk offers different app that can improve and help your sale team stay on track and it is less expensive then other programs,3
my overall experience with zendesk has been excellent and i have been using it within the business for years however as i outlined above it can get quite expensive for a small business if looking to move to a better tier of functionality despite this i would highly recommend the zendesk support software it has never let me down,5
prosutilizziamo giornalmente il programma come chat per lassistenza clienti inoltre dà la possibilità di monitorare gli articoli visualizzati dai potenziali clienti e questo permette di avere uno spettro su quel che richiede la clientela,5
overall we are satisfied with zendesk the analytics are really nice and they also provide stats benchmarks based on all other users for example for first response time,5
prosour support team has used zendesk for the past years and it is a major improvement from our last support system the monthly statistics are great to see how we are doing as a team as well as the knowledge base feature for both in house and customer facing,4
i really dont know i did things before zendeskit has honestly made a big difference in customer care,5
very useful for my customer service requests when purchasing items from businesses that use the platform,5
my company works with telecommunications companies all over the world we currently have offices in the united states canada italy australia and germany when our customers do not need to utilize our immediate livechat service they create support email tickets through our zendesk program i am immediately notified of all incoming requests for support which allows me to quickly respond to the needs of our customers there are lots of integrations and the reportinganalytics allows me to keep track of how we are doing compared to the industry standard since we are an expanding company zendesk has allowed us to constantly meet our customer demands without the normal growing pains,5
we recommend our clients to integrate zendesk products on their websites to increase the number of leads and to make the communication easier it really works,5
overall i would recommend zendesk for startups and larger companies as it covers a wide area and multiple use cases also zendesk has easy integrations with other softwares,5
i have been using zendesk for over years and i find it pretty simple to usethe fact that you can respond via email is helpful as an agent for rapid troubleshooting and respondingoverall i have had a pretty positive experience and just successfully integrated it into our single signon providersome areas to improve would be a shortcut to marking an issue as solvedthis could be helpful instead of having to log in to close issuesadditionally many users reply thanks when you close an issue and this automatically reopens the issue which can be tedious for agents,4
proszendesk is great for managing customer requests integrating with other tools and working crossfunctionally to make sure issues are resolved its also super flexible with a great support staff and help center,5
great software for its role in the customer experience nichesolid analytics and chat feature for our nonprofits,5
it is helping us communicate to clients and resolve their issues on time and hence keeping us more productive in customer service delivery,5
the ability to serve our customer support inquiries with a valuable ticketing service that helped our support team stay on top of issues we were able to sort these issues by urgency and follow up with customers who may not have had a great experience we received a lot of valuablefeedback via zendesk,5

proszendesk has a very user friendly platform there are a lot of different customization options as well making it more desirable than salesforce the latest ticket features are extremely helpful for our business plus they are easy to read and utilize they have a lot of great apps and they have great team support the price is also very reasonable for what they offer,4
someones cheap idea of importing chat into games and programs needs some real coders to either implement it or fix the codeing,1
proslove that zendesk can be used by individual teams and then also for extending this to multi team collaboration and ticket transfers easy to use interface highly customisable with great pluginsexcellent and honest feedback direct from zendesk as soon as a potential platformwide issue is detected with fast resolution to these problems,5
overall good i still like the old green design layout the new one is very generic,5
one of the of the best,5
great so far i wish their most basic plan had more features because it can get expensive if you want more features but even with the basic plan there is lots you can do,5
prosit has many pros but the biggest leverage is the automation using this functionality triggers automated tasks etc will let you respond faster to customers need the other stunning area of data analyse and visualization tremendous insights can assure you can measure anything related to your customers care what you would like to,5
since ive been using it for years and now i am confident using the tool great but theres a steep learning curve for admins for agents this is amazing barely a training is needed very straight forward there are a looot of integrations available which is great,4
overall it was a good experience we ended up switching to a free service which better fit our needs all in all it was a pleasant experience and we used it for years to manage the chat on our site,5
customer support very helpful with requests and will show you exactly where in zendesk you need to look to implement add ons and to fulfil reports excellent forums to find answers which are answered by other end users and official zendesk customer support,5
prosease of use is first the customer service can definitely be improved as they prefer more to share article links rather than explaining things the marketplace has nice appsthe working of help centre is a little complex particularly language related things,4
if you know how to tag anything you can pick up the whole process within minutes of using it for the first time you can create contacts at the site of entry which makes everything faster and easier even those who are not softwaresavvy wont find it a challenge a plus if youre retrofitting this process onto an existing business sop zendesk is especially good for teams that work digitally rather than meeting in a physical space as it helps keep communication open and easy to access for everyone,5
its a great working on zendesk suite as we can easily connect with our customer and customer can easily find us in case they really need us urgently,5

i know the say customers but i question how many are happywere small we manage under websites that need unique customer service emailswe have a few agents some need to see all sites others just we just wanted basic email tickets from inbound email assign to the right person reply all syncs up not too much to askwere about months in and its been a pretty horrible experiencewhile customer service does answer the phone at zen getting the same answer twice is rareyou basically need a phd in zen and very few even at the company have iti suppose a large company pays them to do it or has a dedicated it zen guy on it and gets his own phd in zendeskbut were small under mi gave it stars as the staff is very nice and eager to helpand they do claim they can do itwere pretty savvy and figure most things outzen got close but really theyre not for the small company like usi didnt like that they bait and switched us with free live chat and weeks after they asked us to pay for itoddwe were thinking of using the phone system but i cant review that as we couldnt even get the email ticket system to work so i just dont trust itwe lost thousands in sales with lost ticketsat one point they had marked days of emails all as spam that were legitimate emails,2
overall our customer service response time has improved tremendously customers are happy with quick responses we dont always have the answers they are looking for when we get back to them but we want to at least respond letting them know that were handling it,5

my overall experience with jira service management has been exceptional the platform has revolutionized our incident management process and significantly improved collaboration among team members,5
i prefer jira service management because it is very similar to jira software if you are familiar with jira software you will have no problem using this one concise but effective,4
proshighly customisable service desk portal from the fields to the ui we can set up a new portal in minutes for every new project and easily tie the tickets to our internal jira software projects keeping internal and external discussions separate,5
prosservice management is very easy to get going out of the box for small organizations we stood this up apart from our enterprises main service management tool because we had special needs for our intake forms and this allowed us to do the customization needed without going through rigorous development through the enterprise level tool,3
overall i have been using jira service mangement for years and i love finding about new features and integrations,4
its useful for monitoring progress and coordinating the many tasks that have been delegated in fact the tools progress track can be used to make estimates for the deadlines themselves,4
overall im pretty satisfied with jira service management except for some missing functionalities as described above,5
overall usage of this tool helps a lot for task managment,5
prosits an effective tool for tracking and managing bugs tool is intuitive and easy to use for beginners,5
prosseamless collaboration and communication,5
overall when the software works it does the job its a bit of a nightmare to configure and the costings are not the cheapest but not as expensive as competitor products ie zendesk freshdesk etc,5
prospretty much everything to do with ticket management and notifications from our internal customers,5
so far with their free trials and tiers it has be remarkably easy to get a proof of concept project built and to start migrating into the cloud,5
jsd offers a lot for any company needing to maintain a service desk to manage thesupport requests it handles from its clientscustomers because it is a jira atalassian product it is most likely utilized along with other jira tools and plays quite well with those due to this integration aspect thought the layers of security necessitated within user settings requires a considerable amount of learningtraining which is not easily attained without paying for it from atalassian and while i understand respect and even applaud the marketoriented principle of this it does seem a bit intentional that there are no reliable helps available outside of atlassian for example any tutorials you will find on youtube for assisting with certain user configs settings steps etc are applicable to much older versions of the software and to a great extent are not applicable to the current version this would not be a negative aspect if jira did a much better job at keeping their own internal free help docs etc up to date so as to apply to the current version as wellinstead if one wants highly dependable helps it appears the best way to achieve that is to pay atlassian for their training courses at prices that are obviously calibrated toward larger companiescorporations and blindly undertaking such would seem risky if judged by the extent to which their free user tools are kept up to datethis is not to my knowledge the common experience with most apps,4
customization integrations workflows slas,4
were using jira to manage our tickets and it works well there are solid alternatives and competitors in the field so im not sure for how long well keep using jira,4
overall we are very pleased with jira service management and have implemented incident management processes using it,5
we use on premise version software administration can be burdensome for a small staff updates and monitoring can require quite a lot of time price raised two times since first purchase apart from this the tool has enabled us to precisely structure the service desk reducing by the number of phone calls and emails to better filled forms on the customer portal and the use of a chat addon,4
a stable performant platform for customer support is critical and jira service management has delivered that,4
jira service management offers a robust service desk and itsm solution with powerful ticketing capabilities integration with jira knowledge base features and reporting capabilities however organizations should consider the complexity for nontechnical users the learning curve limited customer experience features and the pricing structure when evaluating jira service management for their support and itsm needs,5
once past the cumbersome process of agreeing on workflows and setting everything up the journey with jira service desk has been pretty smooth i recommend it for teams looking to deal with multiple sources of tickets streamlining the process buys more problemsolving time which users of our application always appreciate,4
it is very user friendly once the adoption and the knowledge of what is trying to be achieved tasks become a huge help on a daily project lifecycle,5
with the help of service desk we get feedback from users about the bugs they find in the product as the result we fix them really fast by adding fields that users need to add while submitting bug we decrease time that is needed to reproduce bug or clarify the issue also we can communicate with user directly if neededat the same time user can always get back and see status of ticket they submittedalso it says a lot when you see atlassian using its own product and using it really well,5
pros we mainly used this tool to plan our tasks for the projects we were working on creating sprint cycles and assigning tickets for each issue is very convenient using jira we can see the progress made by the ticket owner in the ticket description there is a very brief and concise audit history which we can track to see how the ticket status has changed i like the customization feature for each team and each product we can choose what statuses and workflow our ticket should go through and select and arrange them very quickly we can even link the bitbucket repo link and confluence link with our jira ticket which is very handy for developers,5
for me jsd was a challenge that thought me a lot the product is awesome but there is still room for improvement,4
overall jira service management is powerful and customizable but has a complex setup steep learning curve and can be costly,5
pros jira is very simple to setup deploy for beginners can also be used very effectively by advanced users has integrations with other tools jira helps report manage track bugs product features via tickets in place jira has history of tickets work logs etc that help document projects promote overall accountability,4
jira is a highly powerful software that excels in managing software development projects with its robust features and functionalities it offers a comprehensive solution for teams to track and organize their work however it can be overwhelming for users due to the extensive customization options available which may lead to a learning curve and occasional complexity,4
a powerful tool for service management and ticket tracking that has made a difference in my work it has many values jira service management is generally seen as a powerful tool for service management and ticket tracking with many features including customization options automation capabilities and detailed reporting and analytics it can also be integrated with other atlassian tools like confluence to provide a comprehensive project management and service management solution jira is my first recommendation to anyone looking for an efficient solution for their service management needs,5
jira service management is a powerful and versatile tool developed by atlassian a leading software development company that specializes in creating products for collaboration project management and software development atlassian has a proven track record of producing highquality and innovative software that is widely used by organizations of all sizes around the worldone of atlassians most popular products is confluence a content collaboration tool that is often used in conjunction with jira service management confluence is designed to help teams collaborate and share information more efficiently by providing a central location for storing and sharing documents meeting notes and other important information it integrates seamlessly with jira service management allowing users to easily access information from both platformsoverall jira service management is an excellent service management tool with many powerful features and capabilities while there may be a learning curve involved in getting started with it most users find that the benefits of using the platform far outweigh any potential drawbacks with its integration with confluence and other atlassian products jira service management is a great choice for organizations looking to streamline their service operations and improve collaboration and productivity,4
i mainly use it for task management on small projects but i plan to gradually expand the scope of use as i get used to the operation and screen environment since it can be used in a wide range it is recommended that i use it for task management and workflow for smallscale projects with a small number of people to get a feel for its operation sharing issues with project members in other companies or remote locations is possible you can discuss and work on a common visualized platform such as managing work progress and solving problems,4
