review,rating
my elderly father my aunt my late mothers sister and i departed from jakarta to san francisco via tokyo on th may to visit my sisters and the family in northern america this would be my th visit to northern america the last previous visit was in whereas my first trip with japan airlines to northern america was in we took the am flight from jakarta jl which was approximately on time and arrived safely in narita airport at roundabout pm tokyo time transit was less than hours as scheduled and the duration of the jl flight from tokyo to san francisco was approximately hours the plane from jakarta to tokyo was not fully occupied in contrast there was hardly a vacant seat for the tokyo to san francisco flight one thing i noticed from the flight tracker was that the plane flew directly above the pacific ocean from tokyo to san francisco whereas in the past japan airlines would fly north to be near the alaska and canadian shores that really explained why the flight duration was shorter than in the past which would take between hours furthermore both the cabin crew and ground staff were polite and professional in particular by providing excellent wheelchair service for my yearold father right from the checkin process in jakarta until arrival in san francisco international airport highly recommended for senior passengers for northern america bound flight from jakarta,4
dunno how people rate this airline as good each flight we did was subpar service from staff when theres an issue is completely useless,1
i flew japan airlines from bangkok to osaka and its my first time flying full service airlines after stuck flying low cost carriers and from my experience its phenomenal check in process was fast cant believe i got nice legroom space on economy the flight attendants were friendly and polite as soon i seated seat was actually comfortable and there was pillow and blanket included as well headphones and also the seat has leg rest in flight entertainment since its the all seat came with dimmable windows the flight attendant gave everyone a bottle of water to drink and at that time i was thirsty all because the security wont allow water through now guess what delayed departed from suvarnabhumi at in the morning during cruising flight attendants offered me variety choices of drinks of course i choose apple juice but guess what free snacks napkins as well wet wipes now of course i went to the bathroom and its clean speaking of cleanliness seats were a bit exposed but thats fine the seats still comfortable the in flight entertainment has a lot of movies and games hours later the meal was served i got some kind of salmon porridge a salad strawberry yogurt fruits and another salad then flight attendant offered me the same variety of drinks but i choose orange juice this time but guess what silverware in economy its supposed to be plastic but the airline was very nice and gave me silverware then i enjoyed the meal after all its delicious and tasty then i watched some movies in the remaining time then guess what landed early overall i would recommend this airline since the meal is good plenty of legroom great seats and friendly service,5
in a way jal reminds me of my entire japan experience great service nice people but subpar websites trying to figure things out on their site is a bit of a maze forget the app and trying to sign up for their rewards otherwise awesome flight great attendants,5
great maybe best flight experience always on time or even early food is conveniently served hours after takeoff so passengers can get some sleep seat had a good amount of recline and the biggest amount of legroom ever im only around foot and i can stretch my legs out in my seat flight attendants were very helpful as i have accidentally dropped something into the seat structure whilst i was asleep table was averagely large i havent used in flight entertainment but it is worth noting that if you are flying from or to europe you should never pay for the wifi because it wouldnt connect to the satellite overall i would fly japan airlines again,4
deceiving baggage information prior and after making payment terrible customer service agent on line keeps cutting me off had me waited too long when asked to transfer the call,1
would highly recommend jal service great staff wonderful inflight service excellent kind friendly helpful staff all the way through go out of their way to help provide assistance for people with mobility issues all round service top notch would highly recommend,5
nice flight attendants one of the worst online experiences i have every had with an airline the site was totally impossible to figure out and the app never worked for us the premium economy cabin was not worth it and the food was the worst i have ever experienced in the air we love to travel pe and it is usually worth it but not in this case never again,2
i am glad i choose japan airline from la to osaka on their business class about hours none stop for me matter to me most when i travel long haul flight to asian i all way travel in premium economy or business class cabin comfort professionalism of the crews and on time flight was only delay about half hours seats spacious and comfortable not over crowd fight attendant all way have the can do attuite very professional understand english really well they all surprised my japanese not too bad excellent tasty western menu beef is so delicious top ingredients and lovely flavors must try their light meal snake curry potato is out of this world i am so relax and sleep like a baby all most all the way to osaka ps also in lax for international flight best arrived airport less to hour it is busy airport best come early morning no long line up so peaceful and fast moving for security screening so take my word remember early bird do gets the worm you will get pleasant happy journey,5
worst company ever they broke up of suitcases and gave us less than euros the suitcases costs more t han euros never flight with them,1
they are too much into their culture neither they speak proper english nor they have any indian food available even when the flight departed from delhi not even any bakery item or readymade food or any packed item is available this even applies to nonvegetarians also the worst thing was that they dont converse in english they speak only japnese language the inflight entertainment tv is also playing japnese items a very few old english movies forget about any hindi indian movies or shows being in the business class we suffered a lot i cant imagine the condition of economy class passengers i will highly recommend that if you are travelling to japan then please take indian airlines complete no no no to japan airlines,1
on th sept i took the jl flight from hong kong international airport tokyo narita international airport i was so impressed by the highly outstanding and professional customer service provided by the team particularly the cabin crews they were very polite i can truely feel the sincerity from the cabin crews particularly those i interacted with onetoone most frequently with including the cantonesespeaking cabin crew that i also met on my return flight on th sept jl thank you so much japan airline cabin crew team i wish the team all the best a fulfilling and happy career life,5
flew on jals from heathrow to haneda in july i arrived at the airport and had a bit of a wait until the check desks opened but once they opened check in was quick and i was soon on my way to the lounge jal direct you to the ba lounge in terminal but as they are a oneworld member you can you any of the oneworld lounges including the cathay which is probably the best and the qantas lounge which is a close second and the aa lounge which is a distant last if they re open which they all were for my flight which departed at pm my flight left about minutes late but arrived about minutes early which to me is an on tome flight the service onboard was fine but like previous jal flights i dont think the staff feel that confident when dealing with english speaking passengers but all the staff were great the meals were all nice as was the midflight ice cream which for a change on a flight wasnt rock hard i am not a huge fan of their business class seat as while it is very private it does lack storage but is comfortable and i did get some sleep on the hour flight the ife when compared to emirates lacks a lot of choice but was ok but i thought the amenity kit was a bit on the lacking side with no lip balm or moisturizer but it did come with a handy stand for your mobile phone overall an enjoyable and on time flight and i would fly them again plus they have a very generous luggage allowance which is helpful after a few months away,4
i would like to express my sincere gratitude to the jals registration and flight service team of the flight jl tokyo haneda to helsinki finland on sep to my surprise my seat was upgraded from economy to premium economy just before arrival at the counter desk some minutes before boarding the flight was smooth and the flight service team did excellent job,5
the customer service is trash like just look at other reviews and they are rightflight itself was fine i guess bt next time i think ill book ana instead overall basically just like american airlines but a little bit better,3
worst air company experience ive ever had in my life they cancelled my flight and said they would get in contact with me to rearrange the flights which never happened when i called back and asked what happened they said they would return with options and guess what that never happened as well what happened if that they changed my flight and asked me to accept or decline in their website which guess what doesnt work im not able to see or manage my bookings its like theyre stuck on the s the worst air company website ive seen in my life you cant do anything there except to buy tickets i suppose if you have any problem with your booking dont expect to be able to solve it through the website its useless want a refund youll get it but take your chair and wait for a good months for the money to be back in your account dont have money to buy replacement tickets thats your problem i suppose all in all i havent even started my trip to japan and japan airlines has managed to make everything stressful and troublesome thanks japan airlines,1
flights are good but the worst website app and customer service in the entire travel industry and thats really saying something not remotely possible to find your booking on the app or online the chatbot is laughable customer service not available on weekends what you simply cant access your reservation period we will see if anyone actually answers the phone at any point sure any product is unless you have a problem then you find out what the corporation is really like,1
had booked a flight to japan with transfer in finland in finland the flight got cancelled and we sat there waiting for six hours before we got the final call about the flight being cancelled they mainly gave the messages in japanese and didnt seem to care too much about notifying the other passengers in english they also gave snacks and drinks to everyone else waiting but not to us probably because we were not japanese our trip was delayed two days but they gave us accommodation and euros for food those days on the plane they could also have been better at bringing drinks during a hour flight in this time we only got offered drinks about two times other than when we got food other airlines are a lot better at this the worst part of this whole case is the requesting of compensation since we are under the passengers rights regulated by ec we are eligible for compensation for this two days delay you cannot reach them by email you have to call they will make you wait for hours before they pick up the phone and their phone line is terrible so you cant even hear what they say this combined with poorly english makes this whole situation quite frustrating its doesnt even seem like they know the rules so they keep putting you on hold declining our rights or avoid giving answers ive never experienced this poor service its probably a good airline when everythings goes according to plan and when you dont have to reach them though,1
i had a fantastic experience flying with japan airlines jal the staff were courteous the seats were comfortable and the inflight service was exceptional for any assistance you can reach their tollfree number at or visit their office tokyo highly recommend japan airlines for a pleasant journey,5
the best flight i ever had the seat was comfortable food was decent the flight attendants are friendly the aircraft was very clean great airline,5
i am deeply unsatisfied with the service provided to me by jal for a flight change my family has been faithfully flying jal since the late s and have always used jal for trips to japan to see family in the future this will not be the case we intend to fly on one of their competitors that also offer non stop flights and far more reasonable pricing and that does not charge exorbitant prices for a change in flight plans the cost quoted to me to change the first leg of my round trip airfare is more than the original round trip airfare this makes no sense the flight i wanted to change to has many empty seats and will most likely have empty seats when it departs jal needs to examine the level of service it is providing it would be cheaper for me to walk away from my original booking and book a new round trip travel additionally my daughter and wife recently traveled to japan and the food they were served on that flight was abysmal jal had been riding on old positive reviews and ratings from its customers the jal of today is not the jal of previous times and one other thing the website and the app are both absolutely abysmal neither of them perform well and the website does not allow you to search fir a round trip airfare now,1
they scratched my luggage really bad with two big dents when i talked to their cs at the airport they just showed the careless attitude by pointing to a board and told me thats a small scratch they never say a sorry to me in the whole conversation unbelievable careless,1
this is the second time i flown on jal last time was from hk to narita this time my flight wasnt delayed just an hour by a freaking ine and half hour i am writing this review on ground as i cant get on plane yet but i hope it is the same experience as last time which was amazing only stars thi still bad duh when im home its gonna be am or am,2
if you are travelling with a baby avoid jal at all costs unlike other airlines jal has this bizarre practice of allowing only one adult per baby to sit at bassinet seats this means you will be separated from the rest of the family on the plane and have to sit alone with the baby call centres or service counter refused to let my mother sit next to me to help me with the baby i had two empty bassinet seats next to me and still they refused to let my mother sit next to me to help me also for some bizarre reason i was not able to book the bassinet seats when i purchased the tickets so had to rely on call centre and service counter do not trust the message on their website that says priority will be given to passenger with baby they literally mean passenger in the singular form,1
japan airlines inflight service stands head and shoulders above any us based carrier we had problems with my inflight display and the flight attendants went out of their way to fix the issue they were also extremely apologetic the seat is amazing k and the interior noise level was very low you didnt have to yell to be heard,5
i love how they gave a menu for food and how tasty the food was the drinks were really good too i like how they have the latest movies and shows for entertainment,5
i was so excited about my next trip to visit japan and this made me dread ever coming back to the country i arrived hours early as i had a medical letter to get an upgrade hours later i had no upgrade missed my flight and they want me to pay for changing my flight they need to fix their customer service i got bounced around to so many agents only to be told there is nothing to be done and i missed my flight worst flying experience in my life,1
im never flying japan airlines again my new york to tokyo flight was torture with american airlines operated by jal no headphones for entertainment for hr flight food was so so bad now theyre telling me my flight from tokyo to manila that my assigned seat doesnt have entertainment a total of hrs flying time staring at nothing,1
worst customer service ever called them to ask if i can appeal for my nonrefundable ticket to get a full refund due to visa complications they said to submit a refund form and they will get back to me submitted the refund form like they asked and they proceeded to cancel the ticket with no refund i emailed them to say that i did not want my ticket to be cancelled if i cannot get a full refund and they told me that theres nothing they can do because the cancellation has been processed so now i am left with no ticket and no refund,1
whenever you wanna travel japan this airlane is in my humble opinion your best option their staff is kind and the amenities on the service make it worth it i have traveled times and the last two of them where on this airlane every single time we had a great time all the service was incredible and we had no problems at all,5
a year dream come true in september i am going to japan i am chef by trade and worked years ago in the hotel nikko a jal owned hotel in düsseldorf i learned a bit about the japanese culture being friendly with the japanese chefs had a brush of japanese cuisine this experience actually gave me the urge to travel which i actually did i worked in israel saudi arabia china hong kong and indonesia but never made it to japan i am really looking forward to experience a one in a lifetime experience jal business class,5
friendly staff ok food interior of the airplane looks nice the entertainment system barely has english subtitles which is inconvenient because of all the engine noise in economy class english spoken movies are not always easy to follow however we had booking months ahead with family but they did not give us seats next to each other they sell the window seats for extra money so only people can sit together as result dad was sitting rows behind the rest of the family and they were not willing to change it because window seats are paid tried to change it upfront by phone by the seat reservation system in the airport and onboard no luck very sad daughter was crying for an hour weve seen other families being spread over the economy class as well so we were not the only ones so i would not recommend flying with them if you expect the free seats from bookingfamily to always end up next to each other,3
jal is always late they start boarding minutes to the scheduled flight and they end up delaying the flight pilots have chance to make up the lost time in flight but they choose not to upon arriving they apologize for the delays with excuses such as winds heavy airport trafic etc but these are not true assume about hour delay if you fly with jal domestic,2
we flew from bangkok to tokyo and to dallas in july the ground officer at bkk was nice and helpful the air hostesses were helpful for getting medication for my wife the food was delicious the airplane was nice and clean the movies were good,5
this is the first time my wife and i have travelled with jal business class and having got a great deal for travel to the uk we decided to tryout their premium service firstly i want to stress that the cabin staff are absolutely brilliant and although their english is average they do their very best to communicate with you the seats across each row in business is in my opinion too many the seats are only slightly larger than premium economy and as a flat bed turning from side to side is difficult their pricing makes them an ideal choice for value seekers but if you are looking for a true business class experience then perhaps singapore would be far better if a lot more expensive the food on the flights was good especially the steak but the selection was only average lastly the entertainment available to english speaking customers is very poor and well below that of comparable airlines i would recommend them for value and customer service but lacking in the refinements of some of their competitors,3
jal has long passed its peak as a business guest i had to accept a downgrade to economy on a feeder flight i then had to spend hours at the counter in tokyo i had to spend the night in front of the counter the employees were incompetent and just kept apologising i was not given any compensation on the alternative flight then in business the tv did not work i was brought the wrong menu the crew only realised this when the things i had ordered were not available there was no apology all in all i have never been so disappointed with a flight and an airline jals staff are friendly but incompetent in exceptional situations,1
after experiencing a six hour layover my scheduled flight was delayed eight more hours due to mechanical issues they said they could not put me on another flight will not use this airline again,1
i chose japan airlines to take my daughter to school in australia rather than opt for a shorter trip as i read the seats reclined more than most this was true and in addition to very comfy seats the staff and food were outstanding i also managed to get us an upgrade to business class on one leg of our journey and the lie flat seats were something special we were on a newer aircraft from jfk to tokyo and it felt like first class i will def be flying with japan airlines again,5
flew jal years ago and remember it was fine this time around i can see airline has really gone downhill first on the flight to japan our seats were changed without notice i wanted an aisle seat so this was disappointing on the flight the left side bathrooms werent working so only the set on the right could be used the toilet seats also looked like they havent been changed in a long time given how clean the public bathrooms are in japan the fact that the airlines toilets were old and nasty is gross for flight back home minutes before scheduled boarding received notice of a hour delay due to aircraft rotation what the heck does that even mean and if that was the case why not notify us earlier so we could have spent more time in tokyo instead of at the airport i really very disappointed in jal will fly ana next time,1
flew first class on boeing from haneda to chicago overall great experience with hard and soft product lounge at airport amazing as well not much to fault and expectations were met given first class service with a japanese carrier pros amazing multicourse meals and food selection which would give top restaurants a run for their money same with alcohol great amenity kit unbeatable service from checkin at airport to staff on board royal treatment at every and any point in your journey where jal is in charge and has control cons seats show signs of wear and tear given their age also when it comes to style privacy and ergonomics jal seats in first falling behind the times when compared to newer first class seats with other airlines however jal a have newer seats tv monitors on board are not of highest resolution behind when it comes to its competitors bathrooms are nothing special and fall behind competitor first class offerings overall great experience highly recommended,5
the inflight experience was mostly enjoyable with friendly staff and good food and beverage options the premium economy is pretty comfortable for longhaul flights the inflight entertainment had some great selections but i was somewhat disappointed the volume of movies and shows to select from the biggest disappointment came in japan airlines handling of my personal items one of my larger bags was severely damaged during travel to the point that my large suitcase is no longer functional the handle was crushed and no longer extendssee photos when i submitted a claim i was only offered a reimbursement for a suitcase worth close to not to mention the cost of the airline ticket for premium economy the handling of this situation will directly impact my thinking around future flight purchases with ja,3
i wanted to cancel my flight because my wife is pregnant and i want to be there for the birth after numerous back and forth they are still adamant about me paying a usd cancellation fee despite me having a legitimate reason cancelling months in advance tickets being sgd more expensive now than when i booked japan airlines has truly disappointed me with their inflexible and uncompassionate disposition dont you have expecting fathers or mothers among your employees i guess compassion doesnt translate well to japanese no wonder your suicide rates are so high,1
great economy seats service food and entertainment what really stood out was during our rare delay in bangkok jal staff were helpful in rebooking onto a flight that i found while waiting in line that would get us back home in time and give us a layover in tokyo to explore for a while not only did they rebook us without question our bags arrived as normal in tokyo and they even paid for our transportation into the city and a nice hotel room very happy with their service and would fly with jal anywhere possible,5
jal were absolutely fantastic i have flown on the big etihademirates and qatar and i can say with confidence i feel jal were better than all professionalism and service even in economy the flight crew could not do enough for you exceptionally polite and respectful and the kind of service normally reserved for business and first class the inflight meal was delicious hearty and sizeably larger than most other economy sized meals on other airlines seat configuration on the and were which i also prefer as it does feel there is more legroom and individual space compared to most other major airlines all in all long gruelling flights were made much easier and comfortable due to jals excellence in my opinion unrivaled in economy from all other major airlines in europe middle east and usa thank you jal,5
a complete zero terrible experience with customer service today a complete mess and rude customer service i was trying to book the same flight as my family at the same time they were booking but the jal website was showing an error after refreshing the page for an hour and a half i decided to book it the next morning and the price went up although it shows seats are available at the original price through a rd party i called the customer service rep i wish i got her name and she was so rude i told her my name multiple times after she called me the wrong name and then she laughed at me they refuse to match the price even though it was their error on their website my family has booked other tickets and this customer service representative was so unhelpful and rude we are all never flying with jal my family is cancelling all tickets and booking on a different airline i was on the call for close to an hour if i could leave a minus rating i would,1
its efficient but functional theres no personal touch the language barrier was difficult for me as a hidden disabilities traveller the plane was ok but seats uncomfortable food mediocre the vegetarian snack on boarding was a bread roll with a slice of lettuce and a slice of tomato in it jal did get our luggage transferred to a connecting flight efficiently,3
never ever again i had a very miserable experience from their business class everything is old and dirty i flew in many airline companies including qatar airlines and this one cant even come close to qatar and dubai and even lufthansa upgrade your airplanes its nasty,1
this is the worst business class experience i have ever had the planes are old the food is average at best they made me check in timeseach airport they didnt even have an amenity pouch so no eye mask for sleeping the lay down seats are hard and old and the blankets are thin and no you cant have two no online check inso no getting your seat or food chosen ahead of time it was awful,1
lost my luggage during transition flight spent few hours at the airport try to figure that out got to hotel at midnight with no clean clothes and no store open found it two days after and found the luggage was badly damaged with the case cant close completely they offer my us for compensation said because my luggage only damaged one side and its not total lost wtf back and forth with jal in email wasting time and energy jal sucks,1
i bought business class tickets for my wife and me to go to chicago from delhi via tokyo and return via honolulu as such nothing is terribly wrong but overall it is a very poor quality of experience right from check in through to in flight service is okay but soulless the seats are good the television does not really work and is very glitchy very few movies relative to something like united and movies have poor prints and keep stopping or being erratic but the worst part is the cabin service while the cabin attendants are very polite they are politely ineffective a meal service takes hours and in a hour flight lights are barely dimmed and if so then hardly so for hour or so i buy business class tickets mainly for the flat bed and ability to sleep through a red eye flight but jal makes that impossible i would not recommend it to anyone,2
i have chosen jalfor trips to asia and i find that the comfort food and service is one of the best of all airlines i flew on june th on flight from singapore to narita then on flight from narita to sfo on both flights the food is beyond excellent my wife judy ng believes it is michelin star fine dining quality the effort and planning of the food shows excellent work by the chefs and staff secondly i would like to commend the stewardess staff on both flight jal flight and jal flight on june on business class they did such a wonderful job i wrote their names down first names were kondo and handa on flight business class and ms aoki and ms seto on flight business class both on june th i believe me and my wife spoke to each stewardess and were overjoyed with their kindness and service on flight we spoke to the manager of the crew i believe thirdly id like to commend the jal organization for their ability to switch my wifes nonwindow seat to an locked window seat on business and they were able to move me so that we were togeather this request started in singapore jal check in i have a photo of both the ticket agent lady and her manager who took the matter and contacted narita airport staff to execute the seat change what fantastic coordination and service thank you we were met at the gate by jal staff person and she had a sign for ms judy ng wife and escorted to the transfer desksekura first class lounge for reticketing every thing was so quickly professionally done what a overall professional organization and staff thank you judyhippofantyahoocom and richjohnleeyahoocom,5
on june we flew from hkd to nrt on flight jal ms yamanouchi went above and beyond to assist us with our luggage checkin and boarding passes she even included a heartfelt thankyou note making our experience with japan airlines truly memorable we were deeply touched by this personalized gesture thank you ms yamanouchi,5
one of the best airlines out there the flight attendants were super nice the food was great the seats were comfy the plane was clean overall a great experience,5
comparison of the first class services of japan airlines jal and all nippon airways ana service in terms of service japan airlines jal clearly has the upper hand jals cabin crew is renowned for their friendliness professionalism and meticulous attention to detail whether addressing passenger needs or handling unexpected situations jal staff respond quickly and gracefully making passengers feel warmly welcomed while anas service is also excellent it falls slightly short in the finer details compared to jal food jal also excels in the food department the firstclass meals on jal are designed by michelinstarred chefs offering a diverse and delicious selection especially in japanese cuisine the ingredients are fresh and the presentation is exquisite reflecting the chefs dedication in every dish although anas food is also good it is somewhat less impressive in terms of taste and refinement compared to jal hardware facilities when it comes to hardware facilities ana takes the lead anas firstclass seats are more spacious and comfortable providing better privacy and entertainment options the seat design is more modern and comes with a more advanced entertainment system and seat control features however it is worth noting that jal is continually improving its hardware facilities although their latest firstclass equipment has not been widely implemented yet it is expected to catch up with or even surpass ana in the future amenity kits pajamas and slippers in terms of amenity kits pajamas and slippers ana is more thoughtful ana provides highquality skincare products and comfortable pajamas in their amenity kits and the slippers are designed with great care ensuring passengers feel more comfortable and relaxed during long flights in comparison while jals amenity kits are also quite good they are slightly less impressive in terms of detail and material quality conclusion overall jal outperforms in service and food offering passengers a superior experience on the other hand ana excels in hardware facilities and amenity kits focusing more on passenger comfort if you prioritize inflight service and food quality jal is a great choice if you value seat comfort and privacy more ana would be the better option ultimately the choice between the two airlines depends on personal preferences and needs,5
purchased business class route trips for my family vacation from jfkhnd the flight was delayed for a day due to jals own fault and airline promised reimburstment for a single day during the check in following their instruction i submitted the documentations via email to jaljfklljalcom after waiting or weeks i finally called jal upon confirming my information they refused to reimburst for my lost of hotel use which is only relative to the cost of business flights this amount of money is not too significant but morally this feels wrong jal is dishonest and will look to scam you every chance they get,1
i recently booked a flight from san francisco through jals website and was incredibly impressed with the experience the website has a clean userfriendly design that made it easy to navigate and find the best flight options the booking process was straightforward and i appreciated how seamlessly everything worked checking in online was also a breeze allowing me to avoid long lines at the airportthe flight attendants were friendly and attentive if you are flying to japan take this airline if i had to find any drawback it was that there were not as many entertainment options as other airlines but still had plenty of choices,5
exceptional staff attitude from check in onboard up to my arrival in tokyo haneda proactive client orientated and a perfect example for japanese know how of service and respect next time hopefully on a long distance flight,5
we had to fly from osaka to tokyo and then on to sydney our first flight was late leaving osaka because of bad weather so only had hour to get from terminal to in tokyo the staff were very helpful with one staff member walking us and then onto shuttle bus to terminal then another took over through security and waited until we boarded we found them so helpful and the seats in economy were roomy,5
japan airlines is constantly surprising me how poorly they communicate in english one airport has a same day check in while the other is hours before only leaving me and my family stranded in the airport waiting to check in with over degrees outside in delhi airport where there are no restaurants before security they didnt even have a specific check in counter and we had to deal with the unhelpful information desk because of their lack of communication my family has now been put in a difficult situation times on this one trip i was told they have amazing service but only if you know how to find information hidden away on their website good luck if you travel with them,1
awful service unorganized asked for a glass of water and got a rude reply to wait till food is served since there will be water on the food tray such a terrible flight attendant behaviour also there was a question to choose beef or chicken and when i said chicken she replied we run out of chicken so what is the point of asking then and how can you run out of food when you just strated from your base airport terrible service rude attendant probably not all flight attendants just this one i was unfortunate to have serving my row she influenced negativly the whole jal experience can not beleive who they employ,1
worst checkin experience ive every had via self checkin took long time and so many steps and wasnt even seated next to partner online booking managing dificult to use as well and staff at counter coulsnt help to fix,1
jal is my favourite airline if i am crossing the pacific it will be my first choice firstly the cabin crew are superb they go out of their way to serve i was impressed food top notch wines was excellent seat very comfortable a mattress was helpful love the cardigan that they gave the plane was sleek,5
i enjoyed this trip i had paid seating upgrade which made the trip a lot better cm tall the food is excellent and the flight crew are amazing do not buy the wifi it is a complete scam across the pacific and down the coast of china and japan and it never worked nor did they try hard to get it working when asked for help also the plane was in incredible shape the other airlines could learn from jal no duct tape anywhere the plane looked like it was new,4
think carefully about premium economy not the greatest most disappointing is they are part of the one world alliance being a sapphire member youd think they would not disappoint on my return i checked in at least hours earlier i found i couldnt get my preference of an aisle seat what happens is you have couples taking both aisle seat in the centre arrangements and abuse the system they put in in the j seat with is the front seating the problem is that you share both tray an tv screen instead of independently living the arm rest you could only lift one wat between two the person next to me continually ripped open with such force i could not sleep or get comfortable not only that the seat i was assigned to was not comfortable i saw at least four hours to go and i contemplated sitting on the floor eventually i sat on the pillow and blanket to make it less stressful and relieve the pain from sitting not only that they were happy to take other customers meal tray and refused to take mine anyway they blamed the travel agent and ignores the one world alliance sapphire membership thus couples booked both aisle seats and paid for two seat and got three in return while i booked a seat which was nothing more than economy and paid premium prices,1
first my wife and i tried to call jal on the phone the day before travelling they were useless on the phone they could not upgrade us over the phone like every other airline could then they couldnt even seat us together via either the crappy app or on the phone next when checking in at the airport after several failed attempts via phone we were able to upgrade they told us the price would be yen each and we agreed then when they took us to another counter to pay they said the price is yen each we told them the first check in ppl told us the k but they didnt have a clue and we just paid the k so already feeling ripped off next the lounge situation what a joke if i had checked in on the app i was able to purchase entry to the sakura lounge for us both and was happy to pay but then guess what if you pay to upgrade your seat you are not allowed to even pay to get into the lounge seriously wow next im disabled and had registered for mobility assistance i cant walk far or stand for long so i need a wheelchair to the gate i have been travelling all over the world registering as needing mobility assistance and never was asked why until today the counter assistant asked me why i needed the wheelchair and if i was on medication just wow no other airline or country has ever asked these things so right after explaining that she went back behind the counter said something to her coworker the jal employees all seem to work one job in pairs for some unknown reason and they literally laughed out loud at whatever she said now i can only assume that was at my expense so so rude so much for japanese hospitality next it takes two people to take us through security and customs one to push the wheelchair and one to do nothing but supervise the whole thing very weird so they say we cannot access any lounge and leave us our gate as soon as they leave us my wife goes to an information desk and they direct us straight to one of the lounges where we were able to pay and access again seriously what a joke of customer service,1
i was traveling for business and booked my husband as well despite calling jal to connect our bookings over a month before departure they are now saying we cant sit together terrible for the airline meant to be a leader in customer experience,1
i fly all the time and jal is by far the worst airline i have ever flown i booked business class tickets but when i checked in i found out they didnt offer business class on my flight they called it like business class because they offered water and juice but they charged a business class price and listed it as business class false advertising they would only let me carry on my computer and a couple other things that weighed a total of pounds i had to check everything they kept weighing and reweighing until it was exactly pounds we were also in the last group to board the plane i will never fly jal again what a shady airline in the same class as spirit airlines in the usa,1
i took a return flight on th apr from singapore to san francisco on jl and jl and on th may on jl and jl my experience with jal on those flights has been fantastic cabin crews professionalism had been exemplary they were courteous attentive smart and incredibly efficient cabin and toilets were clean well maintained and quiet they were also equipped with automatic bidet illumination and dimming of lights of the cabin were graceful and gentle to the eyes adjustable windows tint instead of the pulldown one excellent foods in the economy class with wide variety of choices of beverages juices red and white wines green tea water soft drinks jal is by far the most customercentric airline i have been on i absolutely recommend jal and look forward to fly jal again,5
it was the worst experience ive ever had on any airline in business class i was seated in a center aisle seat and it was awful i feel they should not charge regular fares for those seats i felt like i was in a coffin the service was almost non existent and the food was yucky it was my first flight with them and certainly my last,1
i have been flying jal for few years now from boston to jakarta and by far the best airline compare to other choices out of bos every single staff from check in to fa are super friendly foods on board are also good,5
terrible service website is useless you cant check in online so when you get to the airport you find out your entire family is split all across the plane and they cant do anything about it avoid this airline,1
i flew from sfo to tokyo on jl then on the same day i caught a connector to kagoshima with my year old father who has issues walking all of the flight attendants were professional and very pleasant they took the time to make sure my elderly father was comfortable and safe i fly alot on business domestically and our domestic airlines could learn alot from jal,5
good seat good food good entertainment jal delivers top class service even in the cheap seats in flight entertainment had one of the better selections ive seen on an asian carrier and more logically arranged an entire season of kimichika kazama kyojo zero was on offer and soaked up flight time much better than scattered episodes of multiple tv shows all the while plenty of drinks and snacks were served a paid exclusive meal is available on flights from japan and i had kabayaki eel for the first time one of the friendly flight attendants explained each of the dishes and how to best enjoy them im not an adventurous diner but everything was tops was very nice to have someone guide me through the menu jal customer service is aces as for the price a bit on the high side at a comparable paid meal on ana is only or just under usd at todays rates impossible to choose between jal and ana theyre both very very good at making long haul flights bearable even enjoyable,5
we flew to japan in both premium economy and regular economy this is one of the best premium products that we have experienced good seating trademark exceptional service and fun food even the economy class seats are newer and feature a better leg support that actually slides forward producing way more comfort will fly again and worth it,5
first time trying jal because i got switched to jal from cathay pacific the food was nice best part was the ice cream and the coca cola nice seats,5
supposed to leave today for a day trip to tokyo to be told my flight is delayed hours due to aircraft rotation i now paid for car services that have to be rebooked and a non refundable night in a hotel that i wont be using my only option cancel entire trip or agree to change no offer to reimburse expenses voucher for future flights and even refused to let me change my return flight to give me my day back,1
spent a lot on business class no internet the entire flight seat would not go flat like it was supposed to so couldnt sleep everyone from jal is very nice but couldnt fix the problem i flew on a boeing on flight home on an airbus plane internet was also terrible working less than of the time thats pathetic for business class on a wide body next time i will fly a different airline,2
first time traveling on jal they were exceptional great layout of the a largest k screen i have seen in any business classto top it off curated business class menu by top chefs and amazing hospitality definitely not my last time flying jal,5
we have visited japan three times our favorite trip was to hokkaido the major city sapporo is a large energetic capital we visited everything from restaurants to sapporos opera house the islands culture is memorable the national park and museum was wonderful we had marvelous passenger treatment on japan airlines we were served with ramen noodles followed up with a halfbottle of french champagne taking japan airlines was a rewarding selection for our family,5
i first time travelled with this airline and the experience was halal food courteous staff best service making the long tiresome flights amazing and beautiful meal and snack times are amazing plus ample legspace and comfortable seats behind business class,5
we were so excited about our trip to japan that we decided to splurge and fly jal instead of the cheaper options i ended up paying k for a round trip flight more than ive paid for any other international flight i was told the experience was great and it was worth the price but that was not the case the person im flying with has status on alaska air and was able to choose seats when i booked the flight i wasnt given the option to choose seats fast forward to trying to checkin and i still didnt have a seat assigned for an international flight that i spent k on the person working at the counter was able to help me pick a nonmiddle seat but the experience was still stressful also trying to find your reservation on their app is a nightmare on my return flight i was never able to access it i am a vegetarian option and picked this as a special meal option the meals they served leaned vegan i basically got mushrooms and rice on my way there x meals and some vegetarian stew and rice x meals on the way home which i didnt even finish the person i was flying with got margherita pizza for his nd meal and ice cream on the way there which are both vegetarian and much better options than what i was served i love airplane food and its usually my favorite part of the flight all the meals and snacks i had on jal were disappointing i tried to sleep on the way home since it was essentially an overnight flight but kept getting woken up by the flight attendants this was also odd to me lastly the plane felt old and nothing special i was hoping to be wowed here as well as i have been with other airlines i will never be flying jal again and would never recommend it what a bummer,3
security immigration there wasnt any separate queue for first business class passengers at haneda then which led to a long waiting time i believe this has changed in recent months lounge instead of jals own lounge we went to the cathay pacific lounge one floor above very plush excellent views of the tarmac and much better fb options boarding zonewise boarding was implemented religiously expect slight delays in boarding time at haneda though seating layout same reverse herringbone seats that were there on our other flights comfortable yes but might be a bit tight for some also the headrest tends to oscillate with turbulence while in lieflat position service kudos to the senior cabin crew members handling business class who were exceptional at their job thoroughly impressed food beverage the best out of the flights we took the japanese fare was topnotch arrival dedicated first business immigration counter at del luggage came on a priority basis as well,4
checkin very courteous staff one of the business class counters got busy handling a premium economy passengers ticket issues and it was temporarily closed thus this led to a long queue for just active counter ie slower clearance than even the regular counters lounge japan airlines has its own lounge at hnl in partnership with american airlines the food was great and so were the garden views boarding streamlimed process with zonewise boarding being implemented seating layout reverse herringbone seats with a pattern comfortable for the flight to tokyo service very good chief purser who ensured that everything was immaculate some of her team members were not up to the mark though food beverage both the japanese western options were horrid as expected from exusa flights arrival we were parked at the very last gate of haneda leading to a long walk to immigration no separate queue for business class passengers,4
i flew from hong kong to osaka taking cathay pacific from hk to bangkok and then connecting to japan airlines jl from bangkok to osaka kansai after arriving at my hotel hilton osaka in osaka i discovered that one of the wheels on my suitcase had been damaged such that it would not roll in certain directions having been rammed in towards the suitcase and scraping the bottom of the suitcase when rolled i initially contacted cathay since my luggage tag was issued by cathay but they explained that airline rules dictate the last carrier in connecting flights is responsible for luggage i then contacted japan airlines and was initially told that any damage had to be reported at the airport before i left the arrivals area or jal would not be responsible i reasoned with jal that as kansai airport provided luggage carts i simply took my suitcase off the luggage carousel and put it on a luggage cart and never had to wheel it around until i arrived at my hotel initially jal staff stuck to their policy but thanks to some assistance in japanese from the staff at hilton osaka highly recommend and my pointing out that jals own website and the conditions of carriage shown on their website only indicate damage has to be reported to a jal office within days jal referred the matter to a manager and i was generously offered a replacement suitcase as a special favour in fact when staff initially contacted me and offered a replacement suitcase that was a zippered suitcase and i indicated my damaged suitcase was a hard frame suitcase and i would prefer that staff actually worked hard to find me two other options that were hard frame suitcases to see if they suited my needs better i had hoped jal could simply fix the damaged wheel on my suitcase but jal explained that repairs would take months in their normal procedures and so was not practical hilton osaka confirmed the same for me by calling local luggage repair companies jal also arranged to have my damaged suitcase sent back to them so that they could have parts of it recycled rather than simply thrown away by me a very green step it started as a frustrating run in with inflexible and what to me seemed like unreasonable policy but it ended on a very kind and generous note with jal going above and beyond to provide me with a usable replacement suitcase in a very quick timeframe as for the flight itself i had a couple of hours connection time and used the jal sakura lounge at kansai the lounge is quite large with lots of seating areas and a dining area where largely food is ordered from staff from the displayed menu and then prepared by staff and placed on a tray to be taken away by the guest the menu items look simple but the quality of the food is always very good and delicious the flight was delayed about minutes due to the incoming flight being late due to bad weather the flight is an overnight flight scheduled to depart am and arrive at am unfortunately this overnight flight has always been operated with a b in a xx configuration in business class with the shell flat neo seat an angled flat seat rather than a fully horizontal flat seat like the sky suite seat on other jal long haul flights i had an aisle seat but as the cabin appeared to be about empty was fortunate to have no one sit at the window seat beside me and so could shift over to the window seat for more privacy when sleeping prior to take off breakfast orders are taken after take off there is a quick service of a snack but most passengers opted to immediately go to sleep about hours before arrival breakfast is served passengers have the option to skip breakfast and not to be woken up by the flight attendants but i think that is fairly useless as the lights are turned up and there is noise anyway from breakfast service to other passengers therefore overall for an overnight flight it is difficult to get much good sleep on this flight particularly due to the angled flat seat rather than a fully flat bed seat nevertheless as always with japan airlines the service onboard is superb and the food is very good the toilets are always clean because the cabin attendants constantly clean and then neatly fold the toilet paper tip into a triangle this is a good solid overnight flight and a good use of time but it is not an ideal flight to sleep on due to the older angled flat seats and the configuration that requires the window seat passenger to step over the aisle passenger for access,4
i asked for isle seat they said no problem i was assigned to middle seat the food also sucks ive had better canned food then that crap for dessert the ice cream was so hard you couldnt chip it with knife so i trashed it never again,1
we had never taken japan airlines boarding jal in sapporo was smooth the stewardesses were very helpful service was marvelous the young lady asked if we would like noodles so she bought ramen noodles she asked us if we woud like,5
daylight flight from haneda airport in tokyo direct to jfk in new york city am takeoff but cabin lights dimmed after first meal for people to sleep premium economy allows you access to the sakura lounge at haneda take advantage its spacious clean and supplied with multiple food and beverages the flight on an airbus was full so nice that premium economy gave you access to a spacious dedicated bathroom dedicated except when the attendants were serving beverages and food in economy bathroom even has a bidet seat checkin went smoothly once you realized that you get your baggage tag from a kiosk before going to the dedicated premium economy line seats reclined within a shell so they do not lean into the space behind or in front of you motorized recline and leg rest controls with a foot rest spacious unless you have a lot of things in the foot well entertainment system was efficient but i found the selections a bit limited as i am current on most movies and am not japanese and so do not follow their tv series ended up listening to soft music to sleep to airline provides noisecancelling ontheear headphones which did a fair job of masking plane noises meals were similar to what i would expect in economy although you were able to request small servings of instant ramen noodles and they handed out steamed buns red bean filling during the flight flight attendants came by often and were very pleasant as i was able to pay with alaska airlines miles at a very good rate this flight was a great value thanks pointme based on a suggested rate in a review of this flight segment by someone else,4
we flew to and from japan with japan airlines and internally to sapporo and were very happy with the flights all of which left on time the planes were in excellent condition with comfortable seating excellent attentive and very friendly service and reasonable meals our only complaint was that the inflight entertainment had only a small selection of films with no recent releases,5
on this occasion our family would like to express our gratitude for the work of the japan air line crew and especially goto san at narita airport who have helped a lot in an incident that we did not want to happen to one of our family members on march,5
excellent service and great staff made for an enjoyable flight meal menu had good selection to choose from good selection of inflight entertainment seat comfortable,4
phenomenal i mean it i was flying jl onboard one of their bs this was the first time i flew food was good legroom was good the ife had so many options crew was very nice be sure to choose this airline,5
flight attendants need better training passengers dont need to be woken up for every little thing if passengers are resting it would be best to let them sleep instead of waking them up to ask them to wear their seat belts even though it was not during a take off nor during landing if they are asleep it would be better not to wake them up to ask them if they want a drink or to eat excessive disturbance of passengers can be very stressful as sometimes what passengers need is a good rest during a long haul flight please train your staff better,2
appealing airline to work with they promised a sky suite for business class and then moved to a smaller aircraft and downgraded to regional business sloping hard old seats advised this was done to save full and that a visa compensation voucher would be provided they even provided a form to claim then refuses to issue it first and last time to fly with them as they outright lie about their business product and it is nothing better them a premium economy half the time as they swap you to a smaller craft with no notice deceitful airline and appalling service,1
yuzuka sonobe and mahiro ito cannot praise these two members of staff the airline should promote these ladies went beyond what was needed and worked through the issues and me and my friend made it to our destination thanks ladies we love you,5
it took nearly hours to serve dinner by time my main course arrived i was so tired i didnt even care about dessert the food was not good at all hospital cafeteria options they did not bother to serve bread with the butter they gave me we had several unnecessary announcements the seats were rudimentary compared to other airlines they did lay flat but i felt like i was in a very awkward coffin i couldnt wait to get off that flight definitely not worth the price poor food uncomfortable and annoying announcements,1
we took this flight from sapporo to tokyo the baggage check took over an hour waiting in line with no direction from any of the staff our flight was delayed an hour and a half due to a late arrival of the incoming aircraft due to this we missed our connecting flight to san francisco jal moved our flight to the next day the only available but did not offer hotel or meal vouchers even though the delay and missed flight was entirely their fault we ended up having to spend an extra usd to stay the night in tokyo when asked if we could get vouchers or even an upgraded seat they said the delay was not their fault and therefore not their responsibility to reimburse us even though it was their fault the attendant originally stated the delay was due to weather but when we corrected her she checked the information and confirmed it was not due to weather but still denied it was their fault overall really poor customer service and will likely not fly with them again,1
this had to be my best flight experience ive had so far jals service is unmatched by any us airline from the getgo you feel welcomed on board and are well taken care of cabin crew is very attentive and polite when you need something they are always coming down the aisles to check on people the food was the best airplane food i have had and was a great start to my trip to tokyo the whole flight was i will definitely be looking to fly japan airlines again when i return to japan,5
was held at the destination airport for two hours and told to pay compensation as a cleaning fee to a japanese passenger as the overhead compartment containing both our bags had a water leak no consideration for any evidence i brought up that showed it was unlikely my fault felt that the airline staff were quite clear in their preference for the japanese customer and had little regard for the international one as their attitude towards the japanese customer was constantly apologetic while the only words spoken to me were to ask how much i was willing to pay the other guy doubt ill be flying with them again with their lack of customer protection and reading the other reviews about them,1
luggage badly damaged and jal refused to take any responsibility very disappointed expected much better have been to japan many times and this certainly is not japanese culture and not what we have come to expect accidents like this are rare but do happen completely unprofessional jal to not fix the issue so unfortunately couldnt recommend your company again,2
i connected from narita to haneda airport at tokyo to take my ovenight flight to bangkok on japan airlines jl transfer from narita to haneda was easy on the limousine bus with frequent departures however it took a bit longer than scheduled due to late afternoon traffic once i arrived at haneda check in was quick using the first class check in and i was quickly into the superb japan airlines first class lounge at haneda based on my oneworld emerald status the lounge is very spacious with a very large dining area on the main floor with a side seating area and then upstairs there is a salon bar area serving drinks including the previously hard to obtain suntory yamazaki yr premium whiskey there is also a separate area upstairs with several massage chairs that offer preset massage programs lasting about or minutes each the lounge is mainly set for ordering using the qr code on your table with a few self serve items such as coffee and cold drinks buns rice and the trademark jal curry and several canapes the food is beautifully presented and delicious and definitely fine restaurant worthy i enjoyed a pork filet with pepper paprika sauce and phyllo wrapped scallop with sea asparagus of course i did not pass on ordering sushi made to order by the sushi chefs if you have access to the haneda first class lounge you will want to go to the airport early to enjoy its elegant ambiance and superb dining my overnight flight to bangkok was operated with a b fitted with the sky suite iii seat in a xx configuration the seat is fairly comfortable but there is not much storage around the seat for your things and the seat is fairly narrow in flat bed position as it was an overnight flight most people opted to sleep as soon as the flight reached cruising altitude if you opt to be served breakfast you will be woken around hours before arrival for breakfast western breakfast is not a strength for jal so i opted for the more filling japanese breakfast which came with a bento box with sections with fruit pickles and various different small bites and then a main of flounder with vegetable sauce and rice as usual it was beautifully presented and delicious the flight landed on time at am bangkok suvarnabhumi airport has a sprawling terminal so it is a fairly long walk to immigration due to the early arrival only one immigration desk was opened for business class passengers and there was a fairly long line up of maybe people by the time i got there fortunately shortly afterward authorities opened up a counter for elderly and those with children and i and a few others in the business class line were ushered over to the new counter since there was no one there i was at the luggage carousel by am out into the arrivals hall by around am and quickly into a car to my hotel soon after that as always jal provided excellent service and delicious food on the flight it is definitely one of my favourite airlines to fly with and i would always recommend it to friends,5
great airline staff were super attentive and did their best to communicate with their passengers the seat was ok for a business class seat a bit tight as we were sat in a reverse hearing bone seat rather then the expected apex suites which are far superior food was a bit of a let down but i would attribute that to the horrible airline catering that exists in north america and not japan airlines fault overall a pleasant and comfortable flight,4
i flew jal from vancouver to tokyo narita japan airlines does not have its own lounge in vancouver and uses the plaza premium lounge that lounge is under renovation so plaza premium currently uses a temporary space just an open area that is cordoned off the temporary lounge is very bare basics offering simple food and drinks served on paper plates and using disposable wood cutlery as plaza premium is also a pay to use lounge the space can get fairly crowded just lining up to get in took a while as the person in front of me was trying to pay to get in using a discount that is only available on the app the flight is operated with a b an older plane business class has the sky suite ii seats where the window seat alternate with being right next to the window with a counter next to the aisle on the even numbered rows or having a counter next to the window with the seat being right next to the aisle instead on the odd numbered rows the cabin is configured xx with all seats having direct aisle access but with the even numbered row window seats having greater privacy with a counter between the seat and the aisle i find the sky suite ii seats to be quite narrow at the shoulder when reclined to flat bed position because the armrest does not lower down and much prefer the original sky suite i seats which are wider at the shoulder in bed position and has greater privacy due to its layout older plane and less desirable seat notwithanding jal flights are always a pleasure because the food and the service are consistently excellent every flight seems almost like a constant competition between passengers and the cabin attendants as to whether the next passenger can get to the toilet first or the cabin attendant will get there first to clean up the toilet for the next passengers use i have been on hour flights with jal where there was never a time i went to the toilet without finding the cabin attendant had already tidy up the toilet and folded the toilet paper into a neat triangle point i usually opt for the japanese meal since they are always very filling delicious and beautifully presented this flight i opted for the western beef offering for a change a starter plate of grilled chicken prosciutto and salad and a main of beef tenderloin with stroganoff sauce and pumpkin and pine nut puree the meal was very good as usual but i confess i miss the beautiful presentation that the japanese meal would have had dessert was chocolate fudge cake which was fine but i always thought japanese chocolate desserts tended to be on the light side and lacked the strong bittersweet chocolate taste i prefer jal now also offers preflight meal reservation for an express meal or a vegan vegetarian meal supervised by chef yonezawa of the japan restaurant no code once again i enjoyed my jal flight and felt extremely well cared for by the cabin attendants i happily recommend jal everytime and the small deductions are for the older plane and the third party temporary lounge,5
worst customer service ever will not fly with japan airline anymore not recommended for everyone my daughter got sick on the plane so they had to return back to narita on the next day they charged me for k for tickets one way from tokyo to ho chi minh city normally cost around k after negotiation they gave me the boarding pass minute before departure time they suddenly asked for my daughters health check by a doctor which they did not do for hours ago so i obviously could not fly that plane damn they want to make money from me that was a horrible memory,1
discriminate airlines as a foreigner on board we got different services such as no choice of meal skipped meal services unable to change my seat with my family traveling with family and wheelchair is not welcome on board nightmare flight,1
this airline staff at the airport were bullying a customer they will not stand by the customer side to understand the situation they have no flexibility even when the policy is unclear or the information is not clear,1
positive the crew was fantastic very sweet and kind lounge access was great too negative seats were not that comfortable food was pretty average same as in economy class considering the premium i paid over eco fare really not worth it,3
hottest cabin it is almost always so hot inside the cabin that i wear summer clothes during winter flights no personal air vents to utilize i bring wet sports towels to stay cool even during temperate weather the airport turns on the heat but during the hot days will turn down the air conditioning impeccable service best airline food,4
this was the best flight experience ever the service the seat from beginning to the arrival was unparalleled with any flights i have ever had the flight crew are genuinely happy and extremely helpful and i felt welcomed and comfortable which was a great way to finish a tiring trip in japan i arrived refreshed relaxed and ready to take on my next adventure,5
what a fantastic flight the service and dining on this flight is the best ive ever experienced and i do a lot of flying a special thank you to aoki who was an absolute angel the cabin crew are a real asset to jal they did you proud comfortable seat too and all in time couldnt find anything id change thank you japan airlines,5
i am writing to express my sincere appreciation for the exceptional assistance i received from your staff member willy at the hong kong office as a senior individual with limited computer knowledge i recently purchased a multicities ticket online and subsequently needed to make changes to the itineraries willys remarkable patience and dedication stood out during our interaction despite encountering challenges she maintained a calm demeanor and took time to accommodate my requests willys professionalism and highcaliber customer service were evident from the beginning to the end of our conversation she not only found solutions for me but also explained all possible options outlining their pros and cons for my understanding i am truly grateful for willys outstanding support and commend her for her exceptional service such positive experience contribute significantly to customer satisfaction and loyalty thank you once again for having such a dedicated and competent team member,5
one of the best airlines from customer service and flight crew perspective business class for their dreamliners are little dated but crew makes up the shortfall airport crew of jal and flight crew is one of the best in my experience of flying for past plus years,5
changed of plane min before boarding ended up hrs delay replaced with dated which has more inferior seat my seat was unable to recline the ground crew was not organised to handle overall contingency handling to be improved although we were compensated with points or coupons we rather they had done more check before assigning the plane however the flight crew was on their level best to ensure our comfort,3
flight as always good but paid usd to use the lounge only to be told upon arriving in haneda that can only access hours before next flight so too late to use so dont pay for the lounge they just stealing your money i am a million miler on one world and cannot even pay for the lounge and get access i sincerely hope jal enjoys stealing my usd as i dont need the lounge hours after landing from a hour flight,4
great big and spacious plane we were traveling with disable person and the lady staff from jal special assistant service at haneda airport special assistant check in next to check in number were very helpful and kind with her professional manner during our last minute boarding she helped us along the way to our departure gate and really provide the best courtesy service in the airlines industry ive been traveling with many airlines and many classes around the world but im truly amazed with jal services,5
i upgraded my ticket from economy to business so my flight with a baby would be more comfortable there was a system error though where my infants lap baby ticket wasnt also upgraded customer service said we could upgrade at the gate at the gate they couldnt figure out how to make the change despite us waiting an hour to not miss our flight we had to give up on the flight i explained i was a nursing mother i was told i was only allowed to nurse her for a predefined short interval at certain times i was not offered a meal service i was not permitted to switch seats with my husband either i ended up finding an empty seat in economy to sit with my baby no apologies or refunds were ever offered in addition the business class seats werent worth the cost of the upgrade they were very dated and uncomfortable the food was the worst ive ever tasted service was disorganized throughout there are many antifamily policies in place such as not allowing a tiny travel pram to be opened in the cabin when deboarding,1
it was flight that was leff than an hour and half they served us dinner which was surprisingly very very good service on jal first is incredible i have previously written bad reviews about jal ground staff service which stands but this time there is a whole separate line for first class passengers that gets you in a special security line wizz inside which isnt fair but i guess thats the way it goes this line is quite commendable and its too bad they cannot offer at least part of the same experience to the economy or business side which i normally use,4
i have flown over a thousand flights and this is a good contender for one of the most disappointing ones deceptive i booked the flight in october on jal uks web site where it offered a business class option once in sapporo i was told that it was not a business class seat despite being class j which internationally is considered as business class and despite seatguru showing the business not premium economy label on the aircraft plan image attached so they are selling under business now the app shows class j something which is not even premium economy here are the benefits of this class no lounge access no priority boarding you are actually boarding last i kid you not youre in group catering glass of cold green tea nothing else over a flight h any other airline does better no priority baggage handling ours were delivered towards the end of a passenger service disorganised its a nightmare to access the app as a guest if youre not a jal member boarding is a complete mess selfchecking self handling of luggage you receive information emails in japanese in the lounge the staff were completely out of their depth when i complained about the situation their first reaction was to give me a lecture on the back of en envelope on the various flight classes when i moved on saying that i would not insist on accessing the lounge but wanted the coordinates of customer relations they suggested that they would process the complaint themselves disappointing chaotic boarding and you are boarding last full fare but half service better fly jetstar this is supposed to be a skytrax airline no way,1
we booked the x seat configuration and paid for extra leg room for the adults with the kids sitting behind us months after we booked we received an email telling us the kids seats had been moved rows back we spoke with customer service and said this is not ok but were told there is nothing that can be done we asked if we could move our seats but were told because we paid for an option that we can not change our seating for the adults days before our flight leaves we received another email telling us the kids seating has been moved again this time to the centre of the plane next to complete strangers we again tried to move next to our kids but again was told because we paid for an option we cant move after an hour on the phone we were told there is nothing that can be done no one else to talk to and we just have to accept the seating plan japan airlines think it is acceptable to split up a family and have strangers sitting next to young children i wonder if any of the management or board members would allow this to happen to there family,1
premium economy includes access to airport lounge the premium economy seats are very spacious the entertainment system is average the food is good the toilet seats are the best with bidet and very clean,4
terrible service from the lady managing the checking counter we only brought bags out of allowance but since one was kilo over she made us open both suitcases and transfer over she also seemed to enjoy making us do it,1
is a great place to visit and i would like to live here i will try to do my best to move to japan,5
as usual horrendous service before the flight in japan typical racism in japan means that if you have a middle name it is often impossible to checkin online try calling in good luck they charge customers for calling themabout cents per minute you then wait for mins for anyone to pick up listening to a repeating message about them not being available that simply repeats on a loop so after youve spent just waiting the staff simply read everything off the internet the same as customerswithout having any power or ability to assist customers whats the point,2
very very bad experience that they broken my baggage and lost my baggage cover i will never choose jason airline one more time,1
impeccable food but only if you have not requested special meals the default meal design is by the red under young chefs jal has hired via a competition limitations only flight segments that start from tokyo hnd and nrt have these glorious meals also if you ask for any special meal you wont get the curated red u menu ymmv avoid transit between haneda and narita as the train ride is a long hm to hm only acceptable with fit travellers willing to sprint difficult with young children or physically infirm unless there is a hour minimum gap between flights you have to collect your luggage and clear two immigrations when transferring between hnd and nrt plan ahead the website struggles to take indiaissue visa and mastercard they really dont want our money the website is slow in every operation the ios app is a thin layer over the website so its equally suboptimal for of the tasks jal needs to learn from emirates etihad and qatar on how to deliver highspeed purchasing experiences app services and features and staffled experience,4
bought a pound ticket booking type x the airline blocked all the window seats saying i couldnt reserve them due to my discounted fare that totally sucks and have to wait hr before departure for online check in,2
this feedback is for those who will travel domestic within japan or i imagine international as well with jal japan airlines they require to take their portable hair straightener today on the last leg of my travel my little ghd portable hair straightener was confiscated as they do not allow hair straighteners i wasnt aware the restrictions were airline based as ana who i flew with to sapporo from osaka allows hair straighteners such as mine on carry on luggage i checked with airports and i guess assumed when ana allowed this that the other airlines would too i should have triple checked i think its silly that one airline allows and the other doesnt strange and not a nice experience therefore i will never fly jal again ana was great and had a seamless experience and at least i would not have lost had i flown with ana again,1
i missed one leg of my round trip ticket from dfwtokyoseoul which was the tokyo seoul part of the ticket because i bought another ticket from japan air from tokyo seoul hours later to spend time in tokyo and japan air canceled my entire return flights from seoultokyodfw and didnt even inform me they are cancelling the return flights leaving me days to buy a one way ticket home on korean air you can be on hold for hours while trying to reach japan air and you end up speaking to someone who is in india because its definitely outsourced and i heard three different stories from three different agents after three different phone calls telling me first i had a ticket it was fine no problem go check in i had seen assignments from another agent saying your flights were canceled because you missed the segment i basically got three different stories from three different agents and ended up with a refund of only the taxes which was a total of what i think is crazy about japan airlines is the fact that theyll cancel your return tickets and not even notify you of that just because you miss some piece of some segment no other airline in the united states will do this this is absolutely ridiculous no way united delta or american airlines would cancel any of your return flights just because you miss a segment of one of their flights you already paid for,1
everything seem to be geared to japanese passengers as though the rest of us didnt count all announcements were primarily in japanese and the stewards barely spoke or understood english i felt discriminated against for various reasons they announced two main meal choices by the time they got to me only one was available a currybased meal which shows poor judgment on their part with more hours to fly anything curry would cause foul odors i couldnt bare the thought of eating something like that there were no other choices and i politely refused poor judgement and poor thinking on their plan to stock insufficient quantity of a seemingly better meal later they came around with a pastry and choice of tea or other drinks i asked for coffee of course i was the exception to the rule and had to ask three times for my cup of coffee and to top it off during our breakfast it seemed as though i was transparent and they chose not to retrieve my tray until all other oriental passengers on the plane were cared for stewards kept passing by and looking at my empty tray but wouldnt even attempt to grab it no i didnt complain act disrespectful raise my voice or even show any displeasure i just simply sat quietly i have never experienced anything that bad even on a lowcost airline i would not recommend this airline at any price unless of course you are japanese in which case you will likely only travel on your home airline anyway shame on japan airlines i would have expected more respect and care for other people like me,1
worst website and combined customer service experienced in a very long time thought i would book a premium economy multicity itinerary for my partners th birthday next year and our recent engagement and was quoted k for economy class and k for premium economy when calling jal to enquire why is the price higher than business class they said it just is taxes and things they did not look into it did not care and could not offer an explanation as a result we had to book economy class if we werent going to japan i wouldnt have booked them at all also the booking platforms advertise the correct price k for both and then jal wont let you book them terrible terrible experience and took hours to try and sort it out wont be travelling with them again after this,1
due to a seizure suffered in tokyo and a resultant week hospital stay i was too weak to walk from the curb to the gate at narita so i requested a wheelchair the desk clerk took our passports but did not issue boarding passes she asked three different times what my symptoms were i stated alternately that i was too weak to walk to the gate my leg muscles were too weak for me to walk i was disabled after a hospital stay after her third repetition of the same question my boyfriend asked her if she was a doctor she said no he then asked if she would like to speak to the doctor that had treated me and started to dial his number she panicked said no and called a supervisor the supervisor said i just have one more question and then asked me you guessed it what my symptoms were at this point i assumed we would miss our flight and would not be given our passports back so i said in desperation that my muscles were too weak to walk to the gate i did not have a contagious disease i was not a danger to their passengers or crew i was not going to die on their airplane and that i was now extremely angry that finally got our boarding passes issued and our passports back the flight itself and the onboard service and amenities were excellent i grieve for people who use wheelchairs all the time and the humiliation they must suffer shame on jal,3
paid more than k extra for a business flight at night and i was coming back in economy during the day im doing it with a little child the company change the flight times with no other option than accept it and we cant change out business location despite having paid k for my tickets i also had to change all my hotel and tickets bookings and the customer service was useless they took days to come back to me with a price of a flight,1
i hate flying overall its terrifying for me jal was the best experience ive had on an airline though compared to north american carriers take off and ascent to cruising altitude was smooth no sharp turns and the pilot didnt full throttle to ft cabin and crew were clean and attentive and had more meals than i thought i would have overall awesome experience recommend jal would book again,5
flew from syd to haneda airport with jal and they were honestly so amazing extremely efficient friendly and consumer focused which made for a great experience the staff are on the ball with their servicing and make you feel as comfortable as possible if you are thinking about flying with someone else think again would fly with jal in a heartbeat,5
we had been late getting to the airport due to a missing bag but the lady at gate helped my family and i she was very sweet she made sure we got to our flight to misawa the flight itself was good but the people make it great,5
i am standing at the airport writing this review hopefully you can read it early before booking your airline ticket and avoid japan airline at all cost my family arrived in tokyo and days after my dad got sick and admitted into a hospital in japan he cant sit straight on the way back so we asked jp to upgrade economy to business class and we pay the difference they said no okay then we asked if we can cancel for medical reason get a refund and purchase a new ticket for business class they said yes on buying a new ticket with no refund fine the day we arrived at the airport to check in they told us the economy seat that we paid for is now cancelled without refund for some safety reason and that reason is for them to sell that seat for someone else im speechless at the same time expedia has not tried to help over the matter both expedia and jp told us to contact the other party for the matter none of them want to refund or help us to upgrade i know it would be a lot if you book everything for your vacation separately but next time i rather take my time to do that on my next trip than have to deal with this headache on top of the fact that our family is exhausted on this trip no one expects their vacation turn into a nightmare but craps happen and here is our story,1
i flew recently on jal premium economy from sydney to helsinki and back flights and i found the seats on the jal premium economy extremely uncomfortable even painful im a seasoned air traveller with silver for live from qantas i flew premium economy with qantas and cathay pacific and i believe the jal seats are some kind of a design mistake they dont recline in the usual manner just the bottom part the seat moves horizontally forward and the back support being mechanically connected attains a more reclined position the seat then attains a very unergonomic shape not compatible with a human body this arrangement also automatically reduces the passengers legroom increasing the discomfort even further there are only two buttons to operate this contraption one for the recline movement and the other one for the lower leg calf support however the lower leg support doesnt function at all due to its low range of motion so it just hangs there i couldnt find a comfortable position and couldnt sleep at all the seats are also very hard and my bottom still hurts a week after the return flights i find it hard to believe the japanese people renown for their design prowess and attention to detail installed these seats on their national carrier on the other hand the service was superb and the food exquisite albeit a bit small on size i also believe the food was the same as in the economy class,3
could have flown with cheaper airline but wanted to try jal flight was a morning flightflew on economy jal wider seats first problem was checking in at haneda i had checked in online and all boarding cards were on my mobile we asked for printed off cards but were told no you had to do your luggage labels and place on conveyer belt and scan mobile boarding cards it wouldnt read ours ended up a ground stewardess had to print off paper boarding cards for us for the scanner to work i saw the queues getting longer as a lot of people seemed to be having problems haneda security queues ran right through the self check in stations so the place was very chaotic and people not knowing what was happening so unlike the usual japanese efficiency you experience everywhere else on the plane now seats werent noticeably any wider but legroom was really good flight entertainment was very poor very limited choice of films screen wasnt very big seemed very dated with a pull out handset to control as touch screen didnt work when seatbelts light went off they came round with a bag of mixed rice crackers and a bottle of water after about an hour trolley came round with lunch and a choice of wine which wasnt very chilled beer was and soft drinks handed a large plastic menu between of us at time of serving choice of pork or chickenhad to make your mind up quick chose pork it was ok served with rice but nothing like beautiful meals we ate in japan also had ice cream no bread or cheese and biscuits just some little dishes of tofu cold broccoli salad and some other cold veg only ate some if it very disappointing after hours into the flight they dimmed the lights and a steward walked round with a pole pulling down any window blinds that were still open it stayed like that for hours he walked around the cabin constantly looking in each row for to check we were sleeping i felt i was in a nursery and being put down for my afternoon nap they closed the curtains round the galley and only came round regularly offering green tea about hours into the flight the lights went on and we were handed a horrible milk tea flavoured kind of cake with white chocolate chips which was very dry to eat then offered coffee or green tea or soft drink now hours into the flight we still had not been offered any trolley service offering alcohol other than at lunchtime my husband went up to the galley and asked for gin and tonics and the steward replied with surprised my husband replied there are of us each when the male steward brought the drinks to our seats he never said a word but frostily sat them down with a napkin and another packet of the rice crackers hours into the flight my husband again went up to the galley and asked for drinks but this time he was attended by a pleasant female stewardess smiling she brought them to our seats smiling half an hour later they came round the cabin with a drinks trolley offering alcohol drinks for the first time during the flight with only hours before landing at no time did they suggest to visit the galley for snacks or drinks you had to decide that for yourself and depending on who was there how you would be treated about hours before landing they brought round something to eat it was in a takeaway box and you had to open containers and mix it all up chicken and noodles but it surprisingly good definitely wouldnt fly with jal again we flew singapore airlines last time to japan economy was like first class meals service entertainment nothing was a bother to them and they constantly came round with drinks and snacks trolley and toilets were immaculate jal toilets were just ok and extremely small,2
this airlines is horrible they treat passengers who purchased tickets from agency differently the system do not allow you to checkin electrically you have to go to the airport and check in at the counter similar problem i still have when have to check in from sfo to bangkok it said i am not eligible to check in through their system the worst thing its system allocates seat for the passengers arbitrary never fly with this airlines,1
booked the flight through american airlines called immediately months before the flight to get seats seats disappeared times jal told me to contact american american assigns seats but they disappear and change got to the airport and seats had changed again all i wanted was an aisle seat anywhere disregarded status on american we were supposed to be able to check in hours before the flight will never fly them again if you are a foreigner they just do t care and wont help you,1
seat was comfortable good leg room for economy etc a few areas let this down compared to other airlines the food including the kids meals is strange its not western its not really mainstream japanese it was odd and definitely not suited to kids even the kids meals our kids left almost all of their meals and most kids trays i saw went back full we were glad we had some snacks packed for the kids when i asked a hostess on the narita melbourne flight if they had any bread rolls or snacks for the kids as they had not eaten their meal she simply said no and that was that the online system for checking in is clunky when doing it for a family at points we ended up with all boarding passes on a single phone but their system at the airport requires everyone to have their own which didnt work our kids are too young to have phones they printed us out boarding passes in narita when we were coming back to get us through one gate but then refused to give us the boarding passes which meant we had the same issues later on in the airport the entertainment system is sufficient but most other airlines have far better entertainment options and variety,3
recently had to cancel a flight due to health reasons and jal staff were fantastic to us the managed the retrieval and storage of our luggage and booked us on the next available flight when we were free to fly everything about their service is fantastic and they really make you feel like a valued customer they will be on the top of our list next time we wish to fly a route that jal service they set a standard other airlines would struggle to to achieve,5
ive flown with these airlines twice and had a great experience both times i enjoyed my flight good food very friendly staff,5
on the way back from europe to sydney flight from berlin was delayed minutes we were told we are too late for our flight to tokyo which was in minutes thats how jal booked our flight with only minutes between the flights we will be put on a next flight at to tokyo as it happened the next flight wasnt for us maybe because we are not japanese we were put on a flight in hours at am to singapore with finnair then to sydney qantas economy we paid for premium and then that was changed again to flight to brisbane and then to sydney arriving at am i dont even know if my luggage will arrive in brisbane or sydney or if ever my car was parked at the international airport so i have to catch the bus from domestic to the international terminal and probably pay extra as it happens our flight was changed back to sydney with qantas economy not sure why but thankfully we arrived safely in sydney collected our luggage and got home safely this is so unacceptable japan airlines you are the worse airline i have ever flown with and never ever againno one at the airport in helsinki was able to help they were saying thats all thru japan airlines so we sat there almost hours with limited food as everything shuts at pm only small kiosks are open and expensive but no choice send an email to the airlines with complain but no answer yet and it has been weeks now,1
the jal service between tokyo and australia was always much better than qantas when it came to food but sadly they have slipped down to the qantas standard with limited and poor selection and poor quality the service and crew were fine the aircraft an older with old style uncomfortable seats disappointed,2
the soft product was amazing the service friendly and helpful the food was exceptional however the hard product was a let down the seats were quite narrow and we are not big people compared to what is out there offered by other airlines these days we ere a little disappointed with the overall product,3
japan airlines uses gate at haneda it is an awful gate it uses buses we had a widebody that was sold out and idiots dont check in their fairly large carryons and shopping bags so the ride gets interesting sarcasm they dump you off at the bottom of those air stairs so there is a rowd of people with their carryons and shopping bags on the tarmac now have to climb the stairs those old folks who have problems walking with their carryons and shopping bags you can imagine the number of steps to get to the door of a widebody very fascinating sercie free exercise workout in hot humid haneda gates through just talk to someone up above and ask that you not be handed a x good luck,1
the staff at haneda airport was extremely rude and incompetent the planes are really old and business class offering was really bad when compared to qatar,1
it was a great flight with great entertainment good food and super friendly cabin crew all stuffs are clean and it was an enjoyable flight,5
i havent flown with jal for awhile so i am shocked with the terrible experience leg room is not so bad however the seat width is miniature size and i am average weight lbs serice from cabin attendant is good even tho they should have provided snacks between st and nd meal considering its hours min flight not sure what the real reason but i am sweating like a pig because they must have turned the ac off half flight at some point it feels like degrees farenheit omg its the most painful thing when you combine not sleeping terrible food and tiny seat and the ticket checked lady in haneda is rude too very shocking thing to encounter since japanese always pride themselves in politeness just skip this airline just go singapore airlines,1
yvr had the worst and most misinformed customer service avoid japan airlines unless you enjoy rude and incompetent staff,1
my family flew business class from vietnam to boston and had connecting flight at narita airport my parents in wheelchairs but werent allowed to preboard or board first based on the ticket class because there werent any wheelchair attendants available at the time of boarding we ended up boarding last food was cold and bland,2
jal has without the worst customer service that i have ever encountered i have been trying to get in contact over points and a confirmation of flight details and you juts can not get in touch with them the phone call was mins and then a transfer of which i hung up after another mins there is no email in this day and they try and make it as difficult to get in contact as they possibly can if you want to have any follow up with an issue baggage flights anything do not fly with them i give them a zero out of for customer service jetstar im australia has much better service and thats saying something absolute disgrace you guys need to wake up to your customers,1
wife and kids flew jal from finland to haneda i prebooked their lounge passes with jal sakura lounge after a hour flight all they wanted to do is shower and have rest before the next flight which is in hours time with another journey to sydney they went to the lounge front desk they were denied entry the lounge entry only allows entry hour prior to your departure time so if a flight takes off at pm you can only use lounge at pm however planes that take off at pm usually board at min before take off basically you get ripped off for your lounge pass paying for hours and only allow to use hours wife asked them if they can set a timer and use the hour and checkout themselves nope they wont allow you wife was really unhappy and tired so she gave up arguing with the front desk staff so i rang and spoke to jal in the australian phone line spoke to the phone consultant to lodge a complaint the guy was very nice and i explained the situation and ask why the logic of paying for hours but only get to use for or hours in lounge he couldnt answer my question i asked for cancellation of the lounge pass and get refund he could not get a refund as they dont refunds apparently what third world country is this so asked him to lodge a complaint for me and he said i have to use their website to lodge a complaint he also can lodge a complaint he said that all calls are recorded i asked if all calls are recorded whats the purpose of recording the calls if you cant use it to provide feedback he couldnt answer the question iam disappointed with jal their lounge access timeframe has no logic what so ever also what third world country technology do they have working there can record a phone call but cant use the recording as part of their complaint process this will be my first and last time using jal customer service is so poor,1
security immigration no separate queue for business class passengers expect long queues plan accordingly lounge the new sakura lounge th floor old sakura lounge sky view th floor surprisingly we werent impressed uncomfortable seats with underwhelming fb options definitely not meant for long layovers the only saving grace was the availability of shower rooms boarding we arrived at the gate on time only to be told that the process was delayed after a considerable wait at the crampedup seating area boarding was initiated in a systematic manner on entering the aircraft the crew guided us to our seats seating layout similar to our previous flight this too had a layout with reverse herringbone seats comfortable with all functions working perfectly fine the only flaw tight seat belts with multiple passengers requiring extenders service not as great as our previous flight but good nevertheless food beverage we chose the japanese meals yet again which were well presented arrival all the luggage was being dumped on the ground by the highheaded airport staff beware,4
great food lounges are a great food private bath clean modernized toilets decent legging space great customer service smooth landings and takeoff,5
i flew on japan airlines from narita to vancouver prior to the flight i used the jal first class lounge at narita based on my oneworld emerald status the lounge offers excellent food and service i tried several dishes by scanning the qr code at my table and ordering and each was beautifully presented and delicious special dishes included appetizers of serrano ham with figs marinated squid and marinated algae and manpuku chinese soba noodles from manpuku in ginza one of the oldest ramen shops in tokyo at the main eating times there are also sushi chefs making sushi to order there were also two different champagnes on offer joseph perrier brut and pierre de bry brut there was plenty of seating in the lounge and in the dining area and even a couple of massage chairs that offer a number of preset massage programs the lounge is an excellent preflight experience and most comfortable and relaxing before a long haul flight the boarding of the flight to vancouver was delayed due to cabin preparation issues fortunately the delay was only minutes and the plane managed to make up the time in flight arriving on schedule the flight is operated with an older plane b business class used the sky suite ii seats in a xx configuration with the window seats alternating between being separated from the window by a counter in the odd rows and right by the window in the even rows the sky suite ii is not the most comfortable of seats as in bed position the armrests do not lower down and therefore the bed is very narrow at shoulder level therefore i found it more comfortable to sleep with the seat in an incline position rather than fully flat entertainment system is not a jal strength so while there were enough movies on offer and some quite current it was quite limited there were a lot of japanese movies and tv programs that were either only available with english subtitles or not available with any english at all in flight service as always was elegant understated and attentive meals served on board were delicious and once again beautiful to look at i had the japanese dinner which starts with a bento box of many different items and then followed by a dish with three separate mains japan airlines is unique in that it offers a special coffee in business class for each flight with a full origins and tasting description in the onboard menu just like for wines in a wine review the one for my flight unfortunately had high acidity which i do not prefer but fortunately it was also a rich coffee and very very smooth overall i thoroughly enjoyed my flight with japan airlines,5
sorry its maybe long but explains thing hello recently i was traveling with family wife and two kids and from naha okinawa japan to bergen norway our first flight on the th of july had a flight no jal from naha to tokyo haneda with planned departure at which was significally delayed because of the delayed weve missed our shuttle bus to narita which we paid for and departed already on the plane flight jal weve notify the crew member about our problem we kindly asked if we could get our luggages one of the first on a belt so well have a chance to catch the bus ironically our luggages came out as the ones of the last then i approached the jal personnel to present my problem and ask for potential solutions we supposed to picked up our additional lugguages from currier yamato and catch flight ay to helsinki departing finnairjal it was then ive realized that im dealing with polite bench of kids where nobody speaks english i understand its very normal if we talking about local grocery store but travel company stasion at airport with no single person able to communicate with foreigner thats very low cheap and armature to me with precious time on table i waited long time for somebody who supposabely speaks english but then communication were bumpy and unproductive turning our already bad situation to even worse to waste more time let me point that i was asking for supervisor from the moment i approached the jal counter which eventually i wasnt able properly to speak with i was forced to take a taxi and when i sat in ive finally saw the supervisor with no second to spare ive just told her that i will complain about that the circumstance created by jal cost me for taxi to narita and tons of stress for whole family along we consulted jal customer service before we choosing a ticket and we were ensured that everything should be ok with those we had i also believe that air ticket also includes an airport fees like taxes security and others it was not our fault that flight was delayed but with absolutely no help from jal it became our big problem i should mention that my wife is japanese and we used jal quite much until now with satisfaction but after recent experience which is every traveler worst nightmare i dont think i will look positive at japanese air lines the email will be forwarded as a copy to whom it may concern,1
this is the best airline i have ever travel the customer service is pretty nice and devoted i have used the ordering touchscreen it is ease to use time saving and convinient as i didnt have to call the attendant but can order my food and process the payment myself i hope all airlines can develop this service it really did personalize my experience during the flight,5
flight attendants were nice inflight entertainment was diversity easy to order food by touchscreens and the payment thru touchscreen really quick best service ever,5
booked a rt flight through aa nrt to bkk bkk to hnd and hnd to dfw were on jl horrible experience everything with jl was cannot do on the hnd to dfw flight a snack service consisted of a slice of bread wrapped in cellophane followed by a beverage service of water only i kid you not this was premium economy jl only serves coke and sprite no diet options i could not get on the web site to preorder a meal jl blamed aa for that jl in bkk indicated that checkin for my flight would start at pm jl staff showed up at pm never again will i shell out premium economy money for budget airline services on jl,1
i will only fly with japan airlines whenever possible they appreciate their customers and run a very tight operation when my family is flying international i feel that we are in amazing hands far from home the international issues and fiascos just dont exist when i fly with jal,5
checkin at the dedicated business class desk which unlike many other airline counters at del was being used only for the said passengers the entire process took barely a few minutes just how it is supposed to be immigration security via the dedicated firstbusiness class lanes which took minutes in total lounge the makeshift lounge at the holiday inn express hotel nothing worth mentioning apart from the amazing views ie much better than the dingy claustrophobic lounges del is infamous for boarding streamlined with business class passengers being called as per the priority category once inside the aircraft the crew was proactively guiding the passengers seats layout in reverse herringbone fashion the seats are comfortable with the functions working perfectly fine the only flaw being the seat belts too tight for everyone i suppose with a number of passengers requesting for extenders service very friendly courteous and consistent no flaw at all one of the best crews weve seen in the postcovid world food beverage we went for the japanese meal and it was good to taste presented very well in short we had no regrets about our choice,5
i usually fly with ana but decide to try jal for this trip not disappointed service on board was excellent and the attention to detail was beyond expectations food was very well prepared and served with care jal is certainly an airline i would recommend to others,5
japan airlines has to be the worst airline ive ever experienced and the worst business class experience im traveling in a family of and weve all collectively agreed that japan airlines has quite possibly the worst both inflight and out of flight service buying business class tickets gives you zero priority unlike stated the flight provides no drinks and when we ordered the beef from the menu we were told that there was no more beef meals flight attendants were international yet did not understand anything in english so it was difficult communicating with them check in at departures was the slowest weve ever experienced at well this was the same for domestic flight check ins overall i would not recommend this airline to anyone not even to my worst enemy,1
we planned a family vacation to europe booking online and choosing our seating as family members suffer from mental disabilities and need window seats or sitting next to another family member we did not fill out the special assistance request as it has never been an issue with airlines in the past so thought it would be ok jal changed the seating plan on of our flights moving us from the seats we had chosen and on one flight to non adjacent seats when we contacted the call centre and asked if we could change the seating arrangement and explained our situaton we were told no they are the allocated seats there is nothing we can do after going back and forth with the operator i said that we would be unable to fly with the current seating arrangement can they move someone else again told no as they will not move passengers from their seating location eventhough ours had been changed having no alternative i asked for a refund which they stated would take to months to process entirely unhappy with the whole situation i sent an email explaining our issues and got a quick reply saying sorry we ask for your understanding but nothing we can do no offer of alternate flights etc just we changed your seat bad luck lesson learned dont care about their customers special assistance policy or anything so beware if you are thinking about flying with jal,1
i would very much like to thank you for the service of mr ariyoshi and his superior at checkin i was very happy with the differentiated service and education that served me and my wife really a very good experience that i will recommend to other people i would like them to know about this feedback thank you very much,5
customer service is non existent the website provides one customer service line with no options for anyone other than some sort of special members but i dialed it anyway called their customer care line multiple times over three weeks and waited on hold each time at least an hour and a half before hanging up i was trying to speak to someone about my ticket i went so far as to go to the airport to try and get assistance there were no ticket agents available so i went to the administrative office and was denied help from the manager because he said if he did it for me hed have to do it for everybody he told me to keep calling customer service and wait until someone answers the phone there is no way to communicate virtually on the website it was an infuriating experience to say the least i never got the help i needed but luckily my trip was great will fly to japan with an american based airline next so that i dont have these issues,1
we spent some time during the peak season june and july in different parts of asia being members of the oneworld alliance we were not able to get on our preferred airline because of schedule conflicts despite that we were able to get tickets from one of the partners jal first time flying jal embarking from different countries within asia and between the us and the conclusion from different routes was that it was consistently below standards we all felt like we were in the economy class instead of business class reasons for not flying jal again the lounge in different parts of the world sucks consistently look at the ramen pic below food on the plane was bad bland cold they went out wagyu beef all the times the aircraft was dirty old had an odor that was irritating if you dont specify the kinds and the amount of food or utensils that you want you will end up putting your finger on the buzzer many many times for instance i asked for some bread i was then given a kidsized cold bun with no butter and jam i asked for water and then i was given water with no ice if dont ask for napkins or toothpicks they wont put some on your tray the whole process was beyond frustrating and inefficient it was like begging for food and services other airlines will offer desserts extra drinks to you without even asking to make sure that you are well fed and hydrated you will assume that fruit salad and bread are pretty standard however if you dont ask you get none they dont have a specify time for the last meal before landing you have to time it yourself or else they will tell you that the pantry has been closed they dont take away your trash even if they see it i think they only take away your trash once or twice during the flight i needed to bag my trash nicely after you order your last meal they will tell you that it is your last order very funny they still struggle with english asking for a cup of decaf tea and was given a decaf coffee and then a cup of tea with lemon was asking for a glass of champagne drappier and a glass of opia the flight attendant kept clarifying to me they were both different it was very funny even that they wanted to put a cap on it was asking for their japanese white and red wine from coco farm they were available on all my six routes some of my traveling members are not diamond emerald members even though they knew that we were traveling together they put us in different lounges and groups for departure did not inform us that our check in would be a training session making us standing at the counter for a long time without apologies they also forgot to give us back our membership cards after checking in they had to chase us back while we were in the security area already flight attendants were stiff and not trying to make you feel welcomed and at ease the cabin temperature at night was way too warm to be able to sleep well when they assigned seats even though they knew that we were traveling together they separated us the seat was uncomfortable and narrower i was surprised by the positive reviews on youtube the truth is that it was not good at all,1
for an international flight home that we were dreading based on the time spent in air this was one of the most comfortable and easy travel components i have had in a long time incredibly friendly and interactive flight attendants helped at every turn we needed customer service reps at haneda airport took great care in addressing a problem with seating that was caused by american airlines i would highly recommend japan airlines for travel,5
worst airline experience in my lifetime been flying years unbelievable sardine can accommodations for an international long haul flight no personal ac above seat first time ive ever experienced this zero flexibility in changing my flight home i highly recommend choosing another airlines had to change airports in japan which meant a mile uber after having to go through customs and claim bag then of course check in again,2
i worked with american express to book our travel to haneda tokyo on july we booked in business class i had arranged seats where my husband had a window seat and i had the aisle across from him today june several days bfoe our trip i saw that japa airlines changed our seats i was not happy i called american express and they were on the phone with japan airlines for nearly two hours i erroneously disconnected the phone i then called japan airlines and i am still waiting for almost hours i understand that if there is a change in configuration of the airplane that they need to change seats this was not the case i sense that because we are not of japanese descent jal felt that it was okay to change our seats we had made our reervations months prior my husband is a wanna be pilot he love looking out the window on takeoff and landing that is why i try to select our seats additionally we like to sit across from each other and not next to each other patricia newman,2
comfortable flight good food reasonable layover luggage intact and courteous staff meets expectations,4
i had a very bad experience with japan airlines leaving from philippines to japan our flight was suppose to leave at pm but was delayed and changed to pm then it was changed again to pm midnight an attendant asked me if i am willing to take a different plane and flight i said yes but she did not approach me again i assume non of the passenger was able to leave with another flight or plane while we were boarding for our midnight flight i heard another passenger discussing passengers were able to leave earlier with a different flight or plane so i felt a disappointment i then asked one of the attendant what was the criteria they made on what passengers are allowed to leave earlier she did not look at me or answer me i had to ask the question again and she said something that i could not understand i could see all the attendants gathering together some were looking at me strange a couple of them pass by me and i was trying to ask for a letter that the earlier flight was cancelled they would not look at me they were trying to ignore me then finally they gave me the letter before i boarded no apologies and no explanation was made this is very poor customer service i regret flying with them i thought i would have a great experience compare to other airlines,2
i had a flight from phillipines to japan at pm it was canceled and change to pm then change again am an attendant ask me if i would want a different fight and plane i agree to take a different flight or plane at am i assume no one was able to fly earlier since no one notified us but i heard passenger was able to leave earlier i was disappointed so i ask the attendant what was the criteria for passengers to be able to leave early they ignore and avoided me they would not makeeye contact with me i was also asking for a letter stating that the flight was cancelled that was the word they used canceled but again i wasbeing ignore then finally the letter was given to me before i boarded with no explanation and no apologies i regret flying with japan airlines i did not expect this from them,1
except the app everything else was great ci automated baggage drop off was not only easy but as well fun space in economy was great biggest good inflight entertainment overall very good and look forward to my next fly,4
since touching down in narita nothing good about jal asian mostly looks alike obviously racism from transiting counter until in flight even flight attendants leader can be racism so disgusting first and last for me with jal my flight info jl nrt to seattle jun if jal can read this i hope you guys seriously look into this racism issue this is a very ugly behaviour shouldnt be in service line if thats the attitude,1
travelled london to tokyo on economy the seats were noticeably wider than other carriers and the layout was great most airlines running the aircraft was clean and modern and staff were very accommodating return flight on formation however managed to book early and got row so just two seats together the seats were a little less comfortable however the service was once again exemplary worth paying a little extra to use this carrier especially the using the sky wider seat layout,5
we took anas flight to haneda in december then we took jals flight to narita in april both were sixhour flights the differences we spotted were prices jals tickets were about cheaper than anas at the time of our booking seats and entertainment legroom was less than anas seats looked and felt older entertainment system looked like it was running on an s os interface movie selection was also less than anas our retractable remote control had some bits of food on it probably because the service team wasnt able to wipe down every single item during the short turnaround time suggest to invest in newer planesseatsentertainment systems which are totally touchscreen and high definition singapore airlines had introduced an app that lets you use your own personal devices as remote controls since this technology was around for over years also no retractable remote controls less dirty corners less bacteria food ana served us japanese mixed nuts twice and dessert was häagendazs ice cream their soba tasted fresh jal didnt have premeal snacks and their somen was a little hardened toilets anas toilets were larger and we observed the stewardesses checking the toilets almost after every passengers exit refreshening it ever so often they also had a bottle of lavenderscented lotion and fragrance spray in each the jal flight we took had none of the above stewardesses anas stewardesses were professional and very hardworking you could tell that they were always on the move but could seem a little cold as they were always rushing jals stewardesses seemed friendlier they smiled greeted and were more patient when asking our kids to choose a toy by the way jals toys beat anas cardboard plane they liked ana seemed to be the clear winner here hope jal update their planes,3
trying to register via their jmb scheme is laborious and eventually impossible via android boot up the laptop jump through hoops a few emails and registered only to find as a member my domestic japanese flights cost more than if i book the exact same jal flight through an online agent maybe time senior execs were hired on merit not time served or who they know they are way behind the game in,1
wife and i took jl from igi to haneda with high expectation from this international airline we were in for a rude shock both food and inflight service were terrible food was as if procured from some roadside eatery cabin crew seemed indifferent i had to remind twice to get a glass of wine to add insult to injury the cabin crew handed over breakfast in plastic bags to us even before we had struggled to finish our dinner the plastic bag contained a sticky muffin flavoured yogurt of an average brand some cut fruits all wasted i assured my wife that food and service should be better in the next sector hanedasfo and indeed it was as if we were flying a different airline it is unfortunate that some reputed airlines give less than average service and quality of food on sectors from to delhi some kind of apartheid inflight entertainment was limited cabin crew announcements in english werent clear,4
sky suite accommodations in business class are among the best in the industry the lieflat has multiple adjustments from recline to flat food and service are fantastic attention to detail from the cabin attendants is outstanding the onboard entertainment is fine but perhaps a bit limited for english speakers on longhaul flights the use of the lounge in tokyo was nice but the food was kept on the second floor level chairs at the windows were not overly comfortable due to a low back and odd recline the lounge itself was quite crowded and there was not enough staff to keep the tables cleaned off so it was not the best experience overall japan airlines did a fantastic job with this flight and we would highly recommend them,5
this flight is the daily itm airport connecting service for international passengers transferring at nrt the flight arrives outside terminal at nrt and then you are transferred by bus to the terminal where you then make your way back into the departure checkin area to once again go through security the flight is just what youd expect from a domestic flight the boarding process was supersmooth because not only do they board from the back of the plane forward they board from window seat to middle to aisle overall a very quick process,4
we were using aa advantage miles for this flight which they marketed as business class turns out jal called it premium economy so we had no lounge access the airport terminal was clean and orderly with plenty of places to have food and simply to sit boarding was well handled and quick as it appeared they board the back of the plane first which worked really well the flight was short but perfectly fine service was good and seats were comfortable the cabin was too warm for our taste overall this was fine for what it was,4
we booked this flight months in advance a couple months prior to departure the time was changed by almost hours with no notification from jalwe just happened to check on it ourselves and found the change yes changes happen we understand however this now required an overnight stay at the melbourne airport at our expense moreover our arrival in tokyo was now timed to arrive hours after our connecting flight departed for osaka jal had changed the time on the longhaul flight but not the connector because our arrival was now late in the day we could no longer connect the same day to osaka so we had to pay for a hotel night at nrt because jal refused they also refused to book a new connecting flight to osaka so we had to make our own arrangements including expense for the tokyo to osaka flight for as premium as the longhaul service was this lack of appropriate response from jal was quite disappointing,3
sky suite accommodations in business class are among the best in the industry the lieflat has multiple adjustments from recline to flat food and service are fantastic attention to detail from the cabin attendants is outstanding the onboard entertainment is fine but perhaps a bit limited for english speakers on longhaul flights the use of the lounge in boston we used the british airways lounge is excellent and even allowed us to board directly from the lounge onto the plane we were departing from gate e we would absolutely choose japan airlines again,5
the airline is very good in terms of offering a competitive price for the great service they are providing the leg space was much better than many other airlines that i had travelled in the past the way in which they handled the checkin process was also amazingly efficient with almost no chaos the asian vegetarian meal was definitely better than the jain meal the light meal served in the latter half of the flight was also great shortcomings the inflight entertainment options were very less i would say could have had more indian movies on the listing charging points just one regular usb point and no plug point provided which i had seen available on many other airlines on the whole it was a very pleasant flying experience with jal and i would definitely recommend,4
wonderful customer service by employee shejin keep up the good work shejin great job from japan airlines,5
we flew on flight jl on the way out to tokyo and jl on the way back to london and both flights were really amazing flight times were between hours each way seats and general comfort me and my partner are not the slimmest of people and sometimes travel on planestrains etc can feel a bit cramped so we were very pleasantly suprised to find on both flights that even in the economy seats on jal the seats were really spacious felt more like a business class sized seating than economy which was great for us the seats were super comfortable you have plenty of leg room my partner is tall and could fully stretch out his legs loads of space for your bags and bits you want while on the plane and even when the person infront reclines you dont really notice any difference in the space around you which is fantastic the head rests are really comfortable and are able to be adjusted in multiple ways to suit everyone seat material again increased the comfort as kept a nice temperature not too hot or cold etc both flights the air stewards controlled the lighting and dropped it to night time settings except during take off landing and when food and drink was being served etc and the lighting subtly transitioned at each point which was nice food and drink the food on both flights was wonderful i personally preferred the food on the flight out there but when i served a dish on the way back that i just couldnt have eaten lots of fish they very kindly swapped it out for a vegatarian dish they had spare flight out to tokyo dinner we both opted for the chicken cooked in japanese radish sauce with rice rather than the beef dish they offered this came with some small dishes on the side soba noodles smoked salmon cream cheese dried tomatoes vinegared cucumber wakame sea plant bread and butter fresh salad shortbread ice cream it was all really lovely but the smoked salmon side was especially good snack red bean bun rice cracker snack pack breakfast omelette with tomato ragout hash browns turkey sausage yogurt fresh fruits croissant drinks throughout generally whatever drinks you wanted plenty of choice of soft drinks a few alcoholic options and then several opportunities for hot drinks flight back from tokyo i opted for the grilled chicken cacciatore with mushrooms and pasta my partner opted for the hamburger steak in ginger with corn mustard rice both of which were nice but not quite as nice as the flight out the sides were sansho pepper kinpira with lotus root fried tofu steamed chicken zucchini with tahini sauce salad of quinoa mochi mugi barley fermented vegetable fresh salad with dressing ice cream snack rice cracker snack pack miso soup this was really special just what i needed lunch chewing tuna clam millet short pasta in a japanese ginger sauce this was the one i just couldnt eat it was far too fishy for me but the air hostess promptly found me an alternative of a mushroom curry which was delightful and very accommodating orange jelly with nata de coco which was very tasty_ drinks throughout generally whatever drinks you wanted plenty of choice of soft drinks a few alcoholic options and then several opportunities for hot drinks cleanliness and bathrooms the planes were both really clean but i have to mention how clean and generally excellent the toilets were on the flight back to london it had the most spacious airplane toilet room i have ever seen it was delightful it had little luxuries like deodorantfreshener spray face towels and was decorated lovely entertainment plenty of films shows music and other bits to keep you entertained i think i watched about films in total on the way out and on the way back but there were plenty more i could have watched i liked being able to make a music playlist also from the songs they have available and given there were so many chilled piano and nature sounding songs i was able to create a bit of a sleep playlist was exactly what i needed customer service so friendly so accommodating really brilliant service on both flights and in the airports at all points where turbulance might be encountered they gave fair warning as an announcement and given my partner is a nervous flyer especially with turbulence it made it easier for him to feel reassured as he said two of the best flights he has taken both were so smooth with minimal turbulence really even given the warnings just brilliant baggage came through quickly at both airports and seemed to have been handled with care flight back arrived about hour earlier than i expected based on jal original time on app winning the views both landing into tokyo and especially taking off from tokyo with mount fuji in the background incredible,5
the premium parts sakura lounge access though the lounge is not among the better world lounges it was too small for the huge crowds and very noisy full of screaming babies for hours on end catering is uninspiring a few japanesestyle dishes strangely there is absolutely no fruit a very basic food item they did have shower rooms and a quiet room with massage chairs and lots of alcohol the wines were of high quality also very many kinds of spirits including japanese brands and the lounge is clean but the fact that premium economy gets you lounge access is unusual and a big plus separate checkin counters for premium economy rather than together with economy and checkedin luggage gets priority after business class some amenities on board slippers and a small bag containing eye shades and ear plugs the seat is slightly better than economy though it is a far cry from the flatbed business seats basically you can recline a little more and have a little more space than economy the economy parts the catering is awful exactly the same with economy meals though premium economy gets you extra alcoholic items on request a quarter bottle of champagne and shochu a japanese liquor nothing in the bathroom no eau de toilette service is polite and efficient but rather cold and distant i suppose this is the japanese style but the southeast asian airlines have warmer crew seat service meals inflight entertainment lounge final thought if youre small size there is absolutely no reason to go for premium economy if youre big size it might make the journey that slightly more tolerable,3
my employee just told me that this pos airline just charged him to make a slight change to his wifes name to match her passport of course since the five tickets were purchased more that hours prior to noticing this they were unable to cancel for a refund and start over so the airline took full advantage of this man and his family this type of customer service should not be rewarded stop flying them immediately there are other options out therefind them they are not traveling until august,1
if everything goes fine with your flight you are lucky if there is any problem good luck every time i try to call i am placed on hold for over an hour and then no resolution when they respond to email they state they need more information although the information they need is on the email and it seems they cannot read english they dont respond to online forms or complaints there is little else i can do but report them to bbb and consumer affairs,1
positives first the lounge that premium economy gets you is really good the first time we have used something like that and lots of free food and drink peaceful atmophere and comfy chairs the seats had a lot of legroom i am foot and i had about a foot from my knees to the back of the seat in front having seats by the window means no disturbing or being disturbed if youre travelling as a couple the food if youre not vegetarian was good the cabin staff were excellent and the toilets were spotlessthroughout both hour flights the negatives the vegetarian food was poor and there was very poor inflight entertainment out and back from tokyo one of our screens didnt work there were games all board games there werent many films and you pay extra for wifi i paid for it on the way back but it only worked for a few hours although to be fair when i complained to the provider not jal they did give me a full refund,3
my wife booked me to fly out with her and missed the date by a day they wont change the fight for a fee they wont let us cancel the only option is to buy another ticket,1
jal from blrnrt was an overall moderate flying experiencethe ground staff at blr check inwhich seems outsourcedneeds a major revamp jal inflight crew were courteousinflight entertainment was limitedfood menu was moderate limitedbeverages were served only when askedwhich is definitely bad inflight service was erratic with the crew confused sticking small slips on the seats at various points depending on the meal preference servings were haphazardground staff at nrt were comparatively better overall a mid experience,3
the service from jal through zipair is terrible my wife got sick just before our travels to japan her family was to fly bkk to nrt she had a tumor thankfully not cancerous we fought for almost a month for a refund from zipair they would not offer anything this was a month for the flight they are horrible,1
i had a great experience flying from nrt to dfw the staff was extremely helpful and provided a worldclass experience,5
flight attendants are not accommodating or understanding of their own layover requirements or airport working hours in their own home country i had five different interactions with agents to try and understand whether i needed a hotel to stay in for an overnight connecting flight resulted in them saying that i may be denied entry for not having a hotel booked furthermore they thought that i did not require a declaration andor other documentation after going thru customs and talking to information desk i was made aware that a booking was not required for an overnight layover even though the main terminal closes at pm the whole airport doesnt close which is what they were saying nothing was mentioned in my booking that i needed a hotel booking they continued to state that one was needed but they were wrong their english speaking ability and comprehension of what is required for a foreigner to do an overnight transfer is poor i would not recommend this airline due to their negligence and the confusion that they caused while i was traveling on their airlines for their incompetencies poor english skills and understanding of foreigners travel requirements for layovers i will never nor recommend travel to japan via their airline it not only represents their airline poorly but also japan itself i hope that they improve but as an american i saw them treat a minority in a similar position as me with the same disregard and misunderstanding food was ok foot space is ok width of seats is not accommodating and i am ft lbs so keep that in mind when booking the stress that their gross ignorance of overnight layover requirements has caused along with their poor english skills and impersonal nod and smile to pass the problem onwards to someone else is appalling,2
extremely unpleasant experience checking in with jal in the flight from tokyo to london firstly impossible to check in the luggage the night before our early flight the morning of the departure only one checkin point worked for all economy checkins the assistants were ignorant limit arrogant requesting intra alia my year old son to move our luggage on his own without proposing any help no help in responding to my request in changing seats or to upgrade to a higher travel class against the supplement as a result i will be travelling with a child squeezed in a middle seat during hours although i have booked different seats during booking such a pity that jal managed to spoil the end of our trip to japan,2
there are several airlines that have very efficient and highly professional flight crew but out of about airlines that i was flying with japan airlines by far outshines them all what fantastic hospitality efficiency courtesy besides legroom in jal if greater than in majority of other competitors the only small complain is about the onboard entertainment that is little outdated and need a refresh and some investment,5
pretty decent flight in business class from paris to tokyo haneda with japan airlines on one of their s with their sky suite in a xx configuration but unlike many cabins with this configuration all their seats give everyone direct aisle access via a small gap for those in a window seat which i was from what i understand only a few airlines use these types of seats and while it was comfortable it doesnt offer a lot of storage space i am not a fan of the with their dimmable windows which the cabin crew can control and stop you from operating which i found annoying at around pm local time as we flew over korea and not able to see out the windows were only unlocked as we approached the japanese coastline on taking my seat i did notice what looked like some food or juice residue on the window and cabin wall near it and mentioned it to the crew and they seemed truly horrified and got some wipes out and cleaned it off apologising profusely the service onboard was fine with good food and drinks including maison brutin besserat de bellefon rose brut nv champagne being served i preordered the western beef menu before my flight which was great the crew was professional but i got the impression that they lacked some confidence when speaking with english speaking customers one of the great benefits in flying jal on my route which was paris to tokyo to sydney was the fantastic luggage allowance which was bags at kg each which is an awful lot of luggage but after just over three months in europe i managed nearly kg split over three bags overall a pretty good flight,4
firstly i dont like the layout of the cabin on this aircraft theres nowhere to store things unless you use the tray table the only other place is a narrow ledge covering the tray table when it is stowed if you are travelling with a companion you cannot interact with them unless you loosen the seatbelt and lean forward there is ample leg room and the seat goes flat for sleeping the cabin crew were friendly and efficient on the return journey there was no estern breakfast availablethey had run out not very good for business class,4
this was my first time to fly with japan airlines the services was absolutely amazing and unforgettable strongly recommended to fly with jal i would fly with jal again if i have any plan to japan big thanks for kben for your kindly services and all crew members on jl thank you krub,5
recently fly on jal times in premium economy and was quite pleased flights were on time check in a breeze and the class of service was quite attentive seats were roomy than us airlines and food and drink options were plentiful i did find that the ife needed a bit more options i will definitely consider flying them in the future when the opportunity is there,5
in january jal still required all passengers to wear face masks this was not justifyable because there is no regulation both in departure and destination countries plus people already know masks are not effective for preventing infection just because this face mask coercion i would not choose jal,1
we travelled as a family of from london to tokyo with three kids under five years old we purchased an extra premium economy seat for our year old as we were told we could strap her into a car seat on top of the premium econ seat just prior to boarding they confiscated our car seat as they were unsure of the regulations turned out they were incorrect and offered no solution for our year old but to carry her on our lap at one stage they said just put her in the seat asleep and strap the belt on the belt did not fit and she fell down and banged her head we asked if we could trade our premium economy seats for bassinet seat in any class economy premium business they refused to do this even though there were available seats as they said it would disrupt the passengers who paid extra for these front row seats none of them had kids it was very ironic given we paid a lot more for a premium economy seat that we could not use i wrote a few letters of complaint to their complaints department it has been months and quite a few follow ups and i have not had one singe reply,1
i havent gone on my flight but ive tried to call them multiple times and wait for at least mins they never pick up i email and their response takes days and the answer does not answer my question,1
sitting in economy there was additional seating space the food and service were outstanding my only complaint was their website which was a bit confusing,4
i reviewed a similar simular situation a year ago the excuse was covid then now restristrictions are lifted but jal will not transfer baggage after customs at haneda to a domestic flight at the transfer desk you have to lug your suitcase to a shuttle bus up the steps hang on to your suitcases and lug it down and to their transfer desk not check in because ive already checked in cannot recheck in extremely inconvenient,1
the service was good but the overall experience was not the plane was old with old tv technology plus limited space if i were a heavy person im not sure i could have walk through the little seat space the seat itself was not comfortable and for a pricey seat option the difference between coach and business was minimal the movie selection was limited and the remote not always worked in fact the flight attendant had to reset it my connection experience was not much better the crew seemed shifty and i had to show my passport multiple on what i can only describe as unnecessary workflow times sadly in an effort to be efficient they had the old sign system for group one then two etc im summary ive flown business class multiple times through multiple airlines and i have to say my experience with japan airlines had to be the worst,1
my first time to fly jal check in was too slow but flight was on time no choices for food we were served a fatty pork dish which was very unhealthy limited choice of inflight entertainment my flight back to manila was very uncomfortable check in was again very slow i was seated in the middle beside a burly passenger who dominated the arm rest and about one fourth of my seat the ground crew should have seated him beside a vacant seat food was again bad,3
bought a jal round ticket from sin to chitose return was with a jetstar codeshare flight was delayed from chitose to tokyo when we got to tokyo we were bumped off the flight hours later still no proper details on whats happening utterly disgusted with how jal conducts its business apparently as this was a codeshare with jetstar though we book the whole trip via jal jal had pushed all responsibilities to jetstar and jetstar of course was pushing it back that jal didnt wait for us by hrs of the of us still standing at the counter only of us were assigned hotel rooms no transfers to hotel was provided no meals no basic water provided due to flight connection hick ups we the customers got victimized no empathy to senior citizens and children who got stranded my yo mom and my yo got rushed mom hurt her leg due to all the rushing and jal takes no responsibility at all disgusting,1
august and hardly any good airline from sydney since qantas goes down with terrible covid recovery and bad management and some how i managed to get business class tickets to london from sydney via hanedatokyo at that time japan was closed to outsiders but transit was allowed as long as its was done before mid night it was great air line experience i have used ja before with amazing food and services and all flights were on time and smooth transit at haneda i will recommend any one flying from australia to take japan air rather than qantas since qantas flights prices and services are now rd class,5
my first time fright best service jal in the world i arrived heathrow then jal staff said this waywow so nice then after on plane so elegant service and passengers and meal restrant taste ohso my suitcase send straight way to lonfon to kochi my home town in japan so good service next time definitely going to japan so clean people are kind and lovely foods and helped a lots for mei was stay minatoya hotel in kochi every day well come gest same jal thank you for jal my best memories in my life to japan,5
what a miserable flight excited to see the had the new sky suite seat but from bangkok to narita and on to los angeles it was so so uncomfortable and could not get any rest plus aggravated an old sciatica problem that took several weeks to resolve i am ft tall and lbs this seat is way too small even the seat belt is too short to fit if spending the s make sure the jal flight has the apex seat in business or go with the much better ana seats,3
horrible customer service for some reason their web site doesnt like american credit cards i tried to purchase a ticket with different credit card and using different divides and browsers i was unable i checked with my bank and i was told that the problem is with japan airlines a number of customers reported this now i wish you good luck if you try to call them over the phone you may wait a couple of hours to speak to an agent the agents are rude and uninformed i talked to a number of them some gave me wrong info others just hang up one quoted to me price times larger than what is on their web site i guess they dont value customers i spent a couple of hours trying to buy a ticket i cant spend more i will check out ana instead,1
great flight great service comfortable and very friendly team i really enjoy flying with jal especially in first class when i can jal set the standards for all others to follow thoroughly recommend jal,5
i had an extremely difficult experience canceling a ticket i booked with bookingcom as the international call center couldnt help me and i was unable to complete a call to the domestic one finally i got to the asahikawa airport to board the new flight and yao was able to cancel my old ticket and refund me using google translate to communicate with me she was patient and kind it was very appreciated after all of the previous rigamorole thank you yao,3
japan is famous for having really good customer service or at least the staff is unfailingly polite when they are in the wrong jal had its staff doing a lot of apologizing as my flight was delayed by over an hour i missed my pickup and transfer connections if i did not have insurance i would have been incredibly screwed over my nd flight with them was delayed again by minutes they seem to have a lot of issues with trying to board and takeoff on time the stewardess are very polite and try to make up for the screw ups but it is unfair that they bear the brunt when whatever their issue is they need to fix it,3
forget about the flight this is the worst website since the early days of the internet how is it possible that a japanese company from a country known for technology can have such a bad website forget the translations it just makes no sense constantly giving errors links are impossible to find and redundant for example they have buttons asking the customer if they are flying domestic or international and if it is before or after april dont ask me why but it is what it is since on the next page i am going to have to enter the flight the departure date my name and some number they use why can they not figure out if i am flying before or after april just ridiculous let us forget that they dont even email you with a welcome email telling you your membership number if you assume it is going to be emailed and skip the page its on you will have to make another account like i did things they ask for email password digit password a one time password ridiculous and after all that i still get errors and cannot see my flight info i click manage booking and it gives me an error and i havent entered any info just utter crap,2
smiles all round but the service is poor and the food quite atrocious the menu is presented on a plastic card and shown to you just before service the food is congealed i made the dreadful mistake of having a spaghetti on the grounds that everyone can cook it not japan airlines i suppose you will get a different class of service if you tarvel business or first but i cannot afford to do so especially since they are considerably more expensive than british airways on the same route,3
the service food and flight were excellent i had to purchase a ticket in sfo exiting manila before they would let me board over and over they pointed out it was an extremely high fare but no worries all will be returned online with no problem well there is a problem the have a form setup to apply for the refund but when selected it sends you right back to the beginning of the refund process yes there is a number to call which took me twentyfive minutes to navigate through and finally hear a voice on the other end that thrill didnt last long as we were disconnected within fifteen seconds yes all out of pocket international long distance rate i wonder how much that is going to set me back fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me this was suppose to go so smoothly they take no messages on website or email contact the chat does not take your email or phone number so how does this help me this was suppose to go so smoothly,3
i am amazed how much different flying international is from flying us domestic the staff seem authentically nice they want to help you have the best trip possible i am annoyed that they force mask wearing but the world is still brainwashed that this helps anything on an airplane i talked to a lovely stewardess about my wife in the philippines i was going to see i shared our story how we go married in costa rica etc then she and other ladies made me a gift bag to give to my wife wow how nice is that i really like the food as well i only wish i could afford a first class ticket if you are considering japan airlines i recommend it remember to be gracious to the staff on board they are nice people any annoying rules are probably the governments fault,5
i flew from vancouver to bangkok connecting at narita airport onto jl from narita to bangkok i had about a minute layover but due to the airport being much busier than when i last flew through in late september i did not have enough time to use the japan airlines lounge after taking time to purchase some things at the duty free stores back in september practically no stores were open at the satellite terminal and only the main akihabara duty free shop in the main terminal was open at that time there were almost no customers and i found staff were actually approaching me to introduce products since i was the only customer in the duty free store this time the experience was quite different i went back to akihabara duty free to try and buy some things but the lineup for cashiers was so long that it ran outside the boundaries of the store and there was no hope that i could line up and pay for purchases before it was time to board my connecting flight on the other hand there were many small duty free shops open in the satellite terminal so i was able to buy a few things from there generally the airport was much busier and many more shops and eating places were open inside the main terminal and the satellite terminal it seems the general expectation is that it is going to get much busier at narita airport in the next couple of months as tourists from china start coming in force jl to bangkok boarded on time for its scheduled departure at pm but pushback was delayed to pm as there were passengers who had checked in but who did not show up on time to board then there was a long wait for take off and the flight finally took off at pm fortunately the flight was smooth once enroute and landed slightly early in bangkok suvarnabhumi airport at pm the flight was operated using a b with a xx seat configuration in business class using the jal sky suite seat all seats have direct aisle access as the aisle seat is slightly offset from the window seat next to it i actually like this seat very much much more than the newer sky suite ii seat as the original sky suite i has armrests that lower down when the seat is put into flat bed position and therefore is much wider at shoulder level in bed position than sky suite ii it also does not lower down as much as sky suite ii which seems a bit too close to the ground when in bed position for the sky suite i seat in bed position you can sit up at the edge of the bed and you are seated at quite a natural level in terms of angle of the knees sky suite i also has a fixed ottomanfootrest under which is ample storage for a carry on bag and there are storage compartments and shelf space all around the seat so lots of places to put things even without the retractable table open the retractable table also swivels so you can get up out of your seat without having to fully retract the table by swinging it out of the way i find the sky suite i seat is very comfortable to sleep in when in bed position much better than sky suite ii the flight was not very full with about seats empty in business class out of a total of seats in business class i had preordered my meal as the menu could be reviewed online around the beginning of the month for flights originating from japan jal business class has meals designed by famous restaurants in japan for this flight to bangkok the western meal was designed by three michelin star french restaurant leffervescence in tokyo so while the japanese meal was designed by the also impressive one michelin star ginza tokyo restaurant ren mishina and the japanese meals on jal flights from japan are always spectacular and spectacularly presented i opted for the western meal of wagyu beef sirloin with wasabi cream sauce and spinach gnocchi the meal did not disappoint from the appetizers to the bread to the very tender and well marbled wagyu beef sirloin it was an excellent meal one of the best western meals i have had on a flight in recent memory an interesting feature in jal flights is that a special coffee of the month is served in business class and the menu includes an introduction of the coffee of the month together with tasting notes as always service on jal was excellent not only are the cabin attendants attentive but they are polite and discreet in the unique japanese manner that western airlines can never replicate also as always the toilets are much cleaner than on most other airlines as the cabin crew clean the toilet after almost every use by passengers masks are required to be worn on board except when eating or drinking and it seemed compliance with the requirement by passengers was very good throughout the flight the flight was an evening flight and i was able to sleep fairly well for a few hours during the flight overall i enjoyed the flight very much enjoyed an outstanding dinner slept well in the sky suite i seat and appreciated the understated elegant service from the cabin crew i was concerned about arriving in bangkok as thailand had recently changed its rules for arriving passengers despite being fully reopened to tourism since october thailand on january reinstituted a vaccination requirement and a requirement for health insurance for covid medical expenses if a traveller originated from a destination or is going to a destination that requires a predeparture pcr test even more confusing by the morning of january thailand cancelled the vaccination requirement i was going to overnight at suvarnabhumi airport and then catch a flight the next day to hong kong which has a predeparture rapid antigen test requirement the announcements from thailand were not clear as least in english media so i was worried i would be asked to provide evidence of health insurance i was also concerned that the flight did not provide landing forms for thailand which i had been used to filling out in prepandemic times fortunately on arrival at suvarnabhumi airport i was able to use the priority immigration lines for business class passengers no landing forms were required and no questions were asked about vaccination history or medical insurance and i was through to the luggage claim area very quickly,5
i flew japan airlines from vancouver to bangkok in january first leg was jl from vancouver to tokyo narita jal does not have its own lounge in vancouver and uses the plaza premium lounge the plaza premium lounge is open to anyone who wants to pay to use it but nevertheless it was not very crowded the day i went it has a food station with hot foods meat lasagne tricolor pasta and buttered corn hot soup and desserts in a refrigerated case that day the lounge did not open the second section at the back of the lounge that has an additional food counter that was a pasta station on a previous visit flight jl boarded on time it is operated with a b with a xx seat configuration in business class with the sky suite ii seat i was actually hoping for the b with the sky suite i seats instead which is sometimes used on the vancouvernarita route as i like the sky suite i seat much more it has a larger video screen is much wider at the shoulders in flat bed position has storage for a carry on bag under the fixed ottoman and has storage space and shelves all around the seat the sky suite ii has a staggered configuration with a fixed counter and headphone storage cabinet next to the seat odd numbered rows have window seats with the fixed counter between the window and the seat and the seat located right next to the aisle whereas even numbered rows have the fixed counter between the seat and the aisle and the window right next to the seat so even row window seats have more privacy and better window views i was in a which is nicely located near the front of the cabin where both toilets for business class are located the arm rests on the sky suite ii seat are fixed and do not lower down in flat bed position as a result in flat bed position the bed is very narrow at the shoulder and it is difficult to sleep on ones back rather than on the side as the flight was mostly a daytime flight i found it more comfortable to use the seat in recline position to nap rather than flatbed position to sleep the flight was quite full with all seats in business class occupied except for one in the last row reserved for flight crew rest use the flight was scheduled for pm pushback was on time at pm and take off was at pm the flight landed at around pm about half an hour early jal has always been very reliable with its scheduling with flights departing and arriving on time consistently as usual service was exemplary on the flight jal has some of the cleanest toilets throughout the flight as the cabin attendants are constantly going in to tidy up the toilet after almost every use service of drinks and meals was courteous in typical jal fashion and meals always look beautiful as well as taste delicious i have a low tolerance for alcohol but was intrigued by the unfamiliar champagne offering champagne drappier carte dor nv and so asked for literally a tablespoon usually i end up receiving a quarter glass or a third of a glass but to my pleasant surprise the purser actually did pour me about one or two tablespoons of champagne perfect for a sip and taste i ordered the japanese meal which started with a bento box with compartments each filled with different appetizers and colorfully presented this was followed by the main of simmered chicken sukiyaki one unique feature of jal flights is that a coffee of the month is served in business class the menu even has a description of the chosen coffee including tasting notes just like for wines one weak point for jal is its in flight entertainment system it has fewer movies and tv programs on offer compared to other airlines and a number of nonmovie video programs were offered in japanese only without even english subtitles on arrival an announcement was made to stay in our seats as japanese authorities would decide the order of disembarkation for our flight those who were entering japan or transiting to domestic flights were asked to deplane first while international connection passengers were told to wait to deplan about minutes later however the lost time was quickly made up as security for international connections was very quick so i was back into the departures part of the terminal by around pm for my connecting flight to bangkok as always i enjoyed my jal flight from vancouver to narita good food excellent polite service and a comfortable seat,5
seat was comfortable enough for economy for short trips but would probably prefer business class for longer travel times food was better than most airlines with the same airfare,4
layout similar to aa business better experience essentials bag nothing special food was disappointing buy fresh sushi or something you like at the airport in tokyo to eat onboard flight attendants made fun of us for bringing out own sushi onboard in business when their food was practically inedible glad we did seats had more space and better storage no pjs though which is expected on hour flights like qatar attendant smirked when i asked service overall average and lack of respect for foreigners i understand japanese and the flight attendants continue to look down on foreigners disappointing japan air overpriced and nothing special choose qatar if you can better in every way you wont want to leave,3
booked through aa thus imagined an equivalent to aa business class japan air added a couple more seats in business making the fit tight no storage space for a phone even one seat row had an added utility box which made the flat bed position impossible to achieve near claustrophobic experience the japanese flight attendants smirked and giggled at inability to finish first course which was a japanese inedible delicacy flight attendants were unprofessional and condescending even my four welltraveled teens were shocked that thai smile domestic thai airways was friendlier and simply more neutral japan air lounge in bangkok was depressing and cold felt like a throwback the whole experience was unpleasant and i wondered what those sitting in economy must have experienced and felt pain for them,2
absolutely fantastic trip the crew put every possible effort to welcome me onboard and to accomodate every possible desire from extra snacks to champagne selection of food presentation and attention are at absolutely highest possible level special thanks to the team of taguchi yuko takemura hinano fai jarupoom na oochi sachiko for hosting me aboard and to making this flight as easy as a breeze thank you again,5
i have been calling japan air for days and cannot get through to a human beingthey claim minute service bs been on phone for days and hours on hold till phone just disconnectsno answer no humans there website is a disaster to navigatehorrible experiencei thought very high of there actual flight service but disgusted with customer service when you need to speak to a person,1
look the folks at jal are super nice and attentive but there are no individual air vents to give any relief when they crank the temp up well over degrees for the entire hour flight same issue on the return flight my entire family of four was complaining it wasnt just me i literally had to use their wet washcloth over and over poured water on it to try to cool off i am so very disappointed because the leg room was nice and like i said the workers are great i dont know what standard puts the temperature so high though it is just unacceptable no personal vent either i dont understand why,2
from boarding till landing it was an absolute pleasure the aircraft was well maintained and cleanthe crew was so caring and i am sure no other flight can ever offer you a crew better than jal my yrs old daughter slept off from haneda to newyork and the air hostess was really so concerned that she had no meals throughout the crew was so polite and responsive other airlines should send their crew for training under them,5
jal is famous for the food even in the economy one isle was served very slow compared to the other isle when my turn came the senior cabin crew asked me which menu that i prefer chicken with herbs taste like indian curry or hambagu japanese style i chose hanmbagu but when i opened it is the chicken with herbs the cabin crew did not know and apologized she went back to get hanmbagu but it was not available anymore it would be better if she apologized for telling me first that there is no more hambagu rather than asking which menu that i would like to have it was just an unlucky day for me why the flight from japan serving a weird menu in the flight to singapore the aircraft is old and toilet is dirty i would prefer other japanese airline than jal i guess movie selection is also not as complete as others including the japanese movie selections,2
the last leg of our trip from tasmania to vancouver was from narita japan to vancouver this was cancelled due to heavy snow in vancouver and the airport there closing down japan airlines put us on a bus and put us up in a hotel for two nights while they arranged a way for us to get to vancouver then scheduled another bus to bring us back to the airport where they booked us a flight to seattle the closest available to vancouver and gave us a bus voucher to get from seattle to vancouver we were provided with food and drink whenever we had to wait around too long at the airport all the staff at jal were literally running around trying to do the best they could for us and we appreciate all the effort and sincerity from the individuals that took care of us during this busy time we ended up getting a delightful visit in japan during our trip thank you for taking care of us,5
going to tokyo was fine no issues there coming back was terrible i had a good start with the checkin and baggage but went downhill from there the business class lounge was pretty decent just incredibly hot and packed full of people the woman at the gate was very racist towards me did not believe i had a business class tickets even after i repeated three times she kept trying to push me out of the line and putting people in front of me i finally went around them and saw a third shorter line that made her angry on the flight i could not get anyone to bring me water i became dehydrated when i asked for food i was asked if i was sure if i should be eating that she was trying to say i was fat so in turn she brought my food ice cold with no water so i couldnt eat it i am not fat btw i am a size and even if i was i paid k for the seat give me water and food,1
this flight was on board boeing with no personal tv screen for this hours flight but jal provide wifi the legroom was great on the narrow body aircraft and the crew was the best drink was served with no snack,5
i flied from bangkok to sapporo via haneda i always fly with jal as their boeing is the best in class with seat arranged in no other airlines has been doing this the seat was very comfortable and cabin very clean their crew was very professional and helpful always walk around the cabin,5
i flu jal business class from sfo to sgn on oct in general seats are good enough to sleep for a long range trip however jal foods either onboard or at airport lounges are subpar dont know if food quality are affected because of covid policy but my flights pre covid on the same route by cathay pacific gave me great satisfactions,4
booked a flight from lax to malaysia and what a wonderful trip comfortable seats and excellent customer service from both the flight crew and jal customer support my return flight did get delayed but only by about minutes cant say i fly often but i had a connecting flight from lax to japan than final destination to kuala lumpur both arrival and return flights were operated by jal and i dont regret choosing this airline would recommend this airline if youre flying into japan they even served hagan daez for desserts on the ride also get sakura lounge access if you have long layover or you can also rent a room w shower i paid for hours to take a small nap single bed w shower,5
we bought multicities bc tickets back in april for flights starting january we recently read very negative reviews of jal on trip advisor and trustpilotuk related to last minute changes cancellations selling prebooked tickets for higher prices no one to talk to at customers services etc all this made us very nervous about our tickets as jal had also made a couple of changes on our tickets with some incoherence we need to point out though that each change was communicated to us via email with that background we called jal for usa and canada and was so happy and relieved that a an agent came on the line right away b she was very pleasant knowledgeable and helpful with updating our itinerary based on changes for which we agreed c she also ensured updating of our seatings with the best available options and finally d sent us confirmation and ticketing promptly as indicated during the telephone conversation in summary we are very impressed with jal quality of customers services and up to now we must say that was our best experience we travel a lot around the world with the best rated airlines as qatar singapore airlines ana cathay pacific air france etc we hope the actual trip starting in january will be as planned and enjoyable why not,5
definitely the best airline i have taken had an hour flight and felt really comfortable sitting in economy the food and service were excellent the checkin process online was very easy the flight attendants were friendly and attentive if you are flying to japan take this airline if i had to find any drawback it was that there were not as many entertainment options as other airlines but still had plenty of choices,5
flew jal from melbourne to narita and on to frankfurt both flights perfect the planes have plenty of leg room lots of space the food and drink was plentiful regular and excellent staff very attentive and polite cant fault anything would definitely fly again,5
avoid this airline inflight service is fantastic ground service not so much you have to transfer baggage after customs yourself if you have four large luggage too bad drag it to the shuttle get to a different terminal drag it out and go to the drop location why cant they set up a drop location near the exit of the customs area like most other airports like all other airports that ive used anyway never had i had to lug my luggage personally between terminals on a connecting flight in any other airline i cannot recommend jal for this one reason,1
jal customer service is a kafkaesque nightmare to deal with very computer says no when i tried to write a written complaint on their website i got a response over a week later advising that if i wanted to make a voluntary change to my flight i needed to call the same number i had called twice before and written about in my complaint there is in reality no way to complaint to jal if you ask to speak to a manager they refuse they repeat the same line over and over again and have to be the most inflexible and unhelpful airline out there the story the ticket was originally booked from glasgow to london and then on to australia business class when plans changed we enquired whether we could just board the flight in london and not glasgow did not seek a refund or any other change we were advised that changes were impossible than if the flight wasnt boarded in glasgow the whole ticket would be cancelled we will be forced to fly from london up to glasgow stay in a hotel over night and then fly back to london in less than hours we have to fly to another country in order to fly back to our starting point its insane imagine missing your flight back to australia because the completely pointless flight you are being forced to take is cancelled and although you could board the flight in london you now wont be allowed to i understand the inflexibility of a ticket which doesnt allow changes but we werent technically trying to change the ticket just board when the flight stopped in london the absolutely refusal to even appear to try to be accommodating was completely shocking in addition the stop over on the way to london changed to a massive sixteen and a half hours over night there is no hotel offered so i hope you enjoy laying on the floor of an airport terminal because they kick you out of the business class lounge at pm,1
browsing the flight modification on my flight and then got notified my flight was cancelled immediately call in just to wait hours for no one to pick up yes no one picks up if you call in then they just drop all the calls when its time to go home and you get to try again the next day tried again for a month flight came and went i lost k i lost all my fn moneyand my flight how the f does this happen go ask them wait ask who because you cant contact anyone and no one responds to anythingahh what a beautiful experienceif the anger i felt could be transformed into hot burning fire i think my whole world would just set ablaze and id be surrounded by burning ash and an inferno at my back,1
i was not allowed to rebook my ticket theres no other option at all for rebooking customer service was crap had to call consecutive days called the whole day just to be put on hold for hours surprisingly someone answered just to tell me im not allowed to rebook after being on hold for hours lmao food was so bad was hungry the whole entire flight no snacks at all between the meals considering our body clock are still in the usa dinner was serve way pass our dinner time the next boarding gate was so far from where we got off not to mention airport staffs were not helpful at all and just to make things much more worse tickets are so expensive just wasted my dollars will never recommend to anyone and i will never fly from this airline anymore this was the worst airline ive experienced so far,1
jal does not transfer baggage for you after customs to connecting flight you lug your baggage out use the terminal shuttle and recheck baggage shuttle bus not level so you have to drag suitcase up and down the shuttle all other transfers i nave done the baggage drop offs were at the end of customs then just go to your new terminal and board for this reason a four dot travel o jal is downgraded to one dot if there was a way to give zero i would do not go to japan place advertises great service but fails to deliver in a big way,1
let me start first by giving credit to jal in operating long distance with configurations this definitely gets rid of at least most dreaded middle seats checkin agents did a great job and when they shifted as gate agents they were equally impressive that the whole boarding process took about mins with about occupancy on the flight the worst part was with the catering i had ordered an oriental vegetarian meal and both the meals were served with just steamed rice and steamed vegetables no condiments seriously jal not even pepper and salt which are staple in the cutlery pack cost cutting on salt and pepper no sauce to add or mix in the other passengers who opted for regular meals were served ice cream and when i asked for one the flight attendant did give a serious knee jerk reaction that she pulled the tray away from her as if i was snatching it and said that it was for other passengers and i cannot be given one appalling service and training from jal later i saw all unused ice creams being dumped into trash while standing in the galley area jal cant you ask for a second serving if some pax want it or keep it in the so called snack bar that you operate like done in british airways note my nd point above you did not serve one to someone who asked for it the so called self serve snack bar had a packet of potato crackers smallest potato chips ive ever seen and may be in the count of of them what is the purpose of this i think jal is very contended in staying out the top league while its national competitor is stepping on the gas every notch if you ever think of ordering vegetarian oriential meal be prepared to eat steamed rice and steamed vegetables like some monks do im traveling nrt sfo tomorrow and this time ive switched to a different offeringwaiting to see whats in store time for jal to grow up,3
so as a taller guy at ill take all the extra legroom i can get the seats were comfy and i had plenty of legroom which was nice the service was excellent as the attendants came around with miso soup green tea and coffee which was a nice touch but now for the not so good my wife and i agreed that this was some of the worst airline food we had ever eaten in all the years of flying it was consistently bad on all four of our legs from seattle to bangkok id fly again just for the extra legroom but because of the food jal is a notch lower than eva,3
i have been flying with almost all the hairlines in the last years economy business class and few times in first class but this airline by far the best airline ever traveled i am very impressed with the flight attendants they put their heart to help passengers and keep the airplane tidy and clean hope all airline follow japan airline in the future,5
when pal canceled our flight homeand expedia was no helpwe bought a ticket on jal the only thing which could possibly have been better was the pod seating on the boeing too tight limited choice of seat positions the food was better than any japanese restaurant that we can afford in the sf bay area usa the flight attendants were the model of japanese care and dignityand you knew everyone was diligent and competent in all they did the business class lounge in narita is huge and seems to offer anything you could need in the future i will spring for jal even if it costs extra its worth the money,5
i have been spoiled after this flight the flight crew was amazing the food spectacular and i slept hours of the flight i was so impressed that i just booked jal again for next october,5
i will write this in a list form point leaving japan lady at checkin counter made me stand there forever because she kept flipping through my passport and looking at the computer over and over again as though she was looking for something she could not find why did she not ask me i dont know so i waited there in the end realising how annoyed the people in the line behind me were and my own frustration i had to ask her is there anything wrong or something i can help you with then she says she cannot find my visa or esta for america mind you when i handed her the passport i had flipped to the page with the visa together with all the covid related document in that page thats solved proceeding to the security checkpoint the man there tells me to stop and immediately closes the line in front of me using the retractable banner he does not explain why he is stopping me i ask him what is wrong he tells me to just wait sir what am i waiting for he does not explain my japanese speaking colleague asks him he then explains that someone at the check in counter forgot to check the expiration date on my visa so now i have to wait a few more minutes for that same lady to come down here and note it before i can pass through she comes writes the information down on brown paper with a pen in my head i am thinking maam why did i have to endure that torture at the counter if you were not taking down my info but guess what i cant argue nor show my rage much because i dont speak fluent japanese and they barely speak english so i am boiling inside the whole thing took forever and the lack of communication was just very annoying especially when traveling with three other people whos experience was so different because of their japanese nationality no need for visas and hence no need for this drama but the real question is was this their first day dealing with a us visa was i their guinea pig why were they so confused and uncoordinated point no wifi on plane point coming back to japan on jl from lax to haneda flight was delayed about minutes but still the airplane staff were ushering everyone to stand up from the lounge seats to stand in line even though the plane was not ready why some people noticing that it is going to be a while sat back down but the jal staff were walking around like police dogs telling people to stand i dont get it baggage on your back and crowds getting smooshed together after scanning boarding passes is not the right tone to set for a hour flight on top of that the inflight meals were a choice between chicken and a veggie curry guess what they ran out of chicken before they even made it half way through the flight what was the logic there i told the lady i dont want to eat and she still brought me the meal anyway i have no idea why to be honest their menu was not appetising to begin with again no wifi and this time movie selection was so different from the jal line when we first came only has older movies yet still listed them as new releaes urghh if i could avoid jal i would because this was probably the worst flights and services i have received in my whole life but i will most likely be back on board again and i do hope that someone with authority gets to see this and makes the necessary changes for the comfort of the customers we are paying way too much tp be treated like this thanks for reading,1
first when i arrive at the airport i cant get to lounge as jal people are not here until pm terrible as this is part of my ticked and travel disappointed part of flight is the overall service no way to write comments on their email as it is directed to online form which rejects it over and over with no clear direction as to why it is easy to score great rating when not a single person can deliver negative comments second has to do with jal website unable to find me in the system every time is it a name issue why is there no search criteria by flight number the only thing is to pick search and system arrives to not found each time when you have late flights and your crew is not here all i can do is sit with crowds at the front of the airport no way to check my luggage go shopping or eat as traveling by myself it is cumbersome to leave the bags there is just a card on the counter showing pm return i guess it is related to when someone will show but cant be sure as it is in japanese is there no way for jal to show another terminal which may have a way to check bags and go through the security i was counting at getting some work done in the lounge not happy not well designed and shows no respect for a customer terrible website for what i am doing no instructions and it keeps rejecting even when those fields are not highlighted in red as requiredsilly and frustrating jal app has a very very low rating yet no one is doing any improvements flight is just one part of the travel service and jal failed before i even started,1
jal business class sold through american airlines the aajal fare from sea to bkk was total for our round trips tickets my husband and i have flown biz class from seattle to bkk many times with eva air first time trying japan airline because covid long story the onboard experience was a shocking disappointment in comparison with eva the quality of everything on our past flights with eva was topnotch especially the fresh and incredible dining experience whereas at jal the salmon and other meat were mostly over cooked i had to spit the food back out after one bite i asked for noddles again eva air had impressive restaurant quality noddles jal had instant cup noddles only really for biz class when comes to inflight entertainment the selection was very limited and of the movies came with japanese subtitle whichs very annoying sakura lounge at narita offered beer and coffee the only food in there was small packaged seeds with two pieces of almonds in each pack the eva air lounges are top quality in all regards including food choices,1
omg what a service i wish that other airlines are like jal this was our first trip to japan ever all started with jal from the time we checked in at lax to the time we arrived at haneda airport we were treated with respect great care and attention the plane was very nice and super clean the seats in economy class are very comfortable legroom is generous compared to other airlines inflight services were impeccable the stewardess always came around to offer drinks tea juice they genuinely paid attention to our comfort during the flight they are so polite no attitude the meals also were above average the entertainment system was great with movies games news flight info etc all in all we really enjoyed the hour flight very much didnt seem long at all hat off to jal and a japanese bow,5
hire another person to answer the phone hours to connect to a person is abhorrent in this age just crap all the way around,1
i must place a review as i was very disappointed with our trip in the above plane was tired and not in the condition i would expect first class was not up to standard i have gone first class a few times and expected the same no privacy in the open seating looked a little shabby toilet facilities were inadequate for first class and the food and wine choice was not up to standard travelled business class from tokyo to sydney in a jl and was cleaner and better laid out for a little privacy also my inflight entertainment did not work kept cutting out hostess tried to fix but would just drop out so was very long flight,2
after leaving late from bangkok but arriving with minutes until connecting flight to san diego they transferred us to another flight to seattle in business class and then seattle to san diego in coach adding hours and a connection through seattle horrible customer service again and paid for business class,1
the flight was cancelled and we were not notified until we arrived at the airport on the confirmed day of travel they booked us the day after then they didnt change our connecting flight and we had to spend hours on the phone on the day we were supposed to travel to try to get new flight to our final destination bangkok they had no space availability and asked us if we wanted to change our plans no the trip was planned and paid for months in advance they finally offered another flight on another airline al nippon at another airport haneda and we had hour layover to transfer and missed a night we already paid for at hotel in bangkok and golf already paid for horrible customer service trying to work this out finally got supervisor who changed flightairport after being on phone hours,1
we were on our way to australia from london via helsinki with finnair the airport in narita was over crowded i must admit the staff did try their best under the circumstances the plane was a but had neoshell seats which did not fully recline the plane was tired looking the food mediocre at best staff were uninterested generally everything was tired had to sleep when you keep on sliding down always wanted to fly with jal never again very disappointed,2
our first time flying with japan airlines and i was floored by the quality of service we received as well as the plane itself everything was clean upon arrival with not even a crumb on the floor as a tall person the seats fit my long legs without any issues not something you find in north america without an extra fee the in flight entertainment had lots of hollywood blockbusters and activities to choose from the staff was lovely professional and were patient with everyone around me the inflight meal was the best ive had on any flight ive taken and that have been a few hundred delicious flavourful hot and there was a lot to consume i will definitely be flying with this airline again,5
prior to the pandemic i frequently travelled with jal and its always been a great experience on october nd i took the am flight from hndlhr as i was boarding i realized i forgot to return my pocket wifi shimadasan who works for jal was a huge help and kindly took care of this for me i really appreciate her help and support super employee five stars,5
routing lgaord aa ordnrt jl nrt cgk jl and cgknrt jl nrtlax jl lax jfk aa was honestly excited to experience jal business class especially with a reasonable aajl fare from nyccgk at rt for business class as i sit at home recovering from this trip however i am nothing but disappointed mostly because my last flight from laxjfk on aa somehow provided better service than any of my jal flights i had ordered a vegetarianvegan meal which was confirmed on my outbound trip but not on the return leading to a very unpleasant experience the vegan meals when they were offered on the outbound were pathetic for the main course of a meal on a hour flight from ordnrt was one small boiled carrot with white rice and a piece of cabbage over the top the second meal of that flight was slightly better and the connecting flight had passable service except for the prelanding meal in cgk which was a bun with maybe two bites of vegetables served in blue plastic wrap thats somehow supposed to be acceptable in business class i mean across the board the hardproduct on jal sucks unless you have the apexsuite skysuite original on the w and select s however i had the skysuite iii on my flights fromto the usa and the shell flat neo my flights tofrom cgk to think what airlines invest in business class in the transatlantic market from nyc on flights of similar length or even shorter than nrtcgknrt jal should feel the shame of offering this product that was at no point competitive i cant fault any of the cabin crew however their main objective seemed to be avoiding conflict which i of course was not going to engage regardless of the meal discrepancy i had on the return i you do not have status with jal or oneworld and are only flying business class expect zero special treatment or priority including baggage delivery the airport experience boarding the nrtlax flight was shocking as they corralled everyone into the gate area at narita only to line up group have those in group stand up waiting in line while everyone else crowded around to wait including those in group the standard business class boarding group to be honest and i am being truthful in my personal experience i have flown similar distances on other airlines in economy class and felt more rested and less ripped off than in japan airlines business class further the entertainment selection and hardware is not sufficient for the lengthy itineraries that jal sells it truly makes me sad to write such a harsh review especially when the service was so well intentioned or at least manufactured to be however i could never in good conscience recommend jal business class when the only positives are the showers in the sakura lounge at narita and the packaged rice crackers with two yes im serious almonds in each pack something probably has to be done to improve the passenger experience,2
the good the bad and the jal fawlty towers airline style be careful if you did not see this for yourselves you would not believe it jal flight number jfk new york to tokyo th october as frequent international travelers vips with major airlines and life member of qantas we decided to use some points for a simple premium economy flight from new york to tokyo with japan airlines remember the name easy points used flights booked all good until we arrived at jfk airport days earlier we had tried to catch the flight but due to covid updated regulations we needed a pcr test so the flight was postponed we then paid the additional charge to qantas all good we thought japan airlines then informed us on our arrival via their supervisor our tickets were fake we were not confirmed on the flight yes fake and we were to call our bank immediately and put a hold on the payment earlier that morning we had double checked with qantas eddie from customer service was great not only did he confirm all good he called back to make sure everything was ok until we got to the check in at jal we showed our email confirmed tickets to the jal manager answer no we showed our receipt of payment answer no quote you have been scammed call your bank and stop payment the manager did imply we could but another ticket while my wife tried calling our bank i thought hang on wait i called qantas customer service and asked for eddie no problem eddie asks how i can help he was stunned he says tell them to look at their screen jal manager says no its fake and walks away from me his name he would not show us but it was not japanese he was in his mids and the name sounded like isuze with a mideuropean accent i call eddie again he says this is crazy ask him to get on the phone with me at this point sometime later the manager is now trying to avoid me i call to him in front of everyone and in a very calm respectful tone please speak to eddie from qantas here is the phone eddie says to tell you all you have to do is look at your screen he still refuses to talk with eddie well well the manager looks at the screen and guess what our tickets were there all along no apology nothing thank you qantas thank you eddie jal if this is the quality of your management you have problems big problems and by the way the flight was fine,2
just got back from europe after a very disappointing business class experience cabin and ground staff were rude and unhelpful western food options inflight were very low quality compared to japanese meal options flew on a and seat was very uncomfortable not able to fully recline seat into a flat bed and was very claustrophobic business class lounge at haneda airport has very limited food options and no showers after a hour flight and then another hours to come being able to have a shower during a layover is very important and all jal had was a small change room also no shops open i the transit area at haneda so not able to do any duty free shopping wont be travelling jal again,2
japanese corporate websites are notoriously bad but japan airlines is the worse it is impossible to know if your flight has been booked or not the customer service phone line often rings busy and then when you get it you are on hold until the line hangs up i do not ever want to fly japan airines if i can avoid it,1
except for having trouble getting in contact with them a few months ago when one of our flight connection wasnt going to work and we did get it sorted we have no complaints we got updates via emails while away and no changes were made service was good both planes and staff so for us we were perfectly satisfied with jal,4
very bad experience with customer service i called in days and when they re route me to the department always nobody pick up this was in the span of days of hours just calling them,1
i would not understand why the hr flight will be using regional business seat as instead of sky suite we fly business class long haul for more privacy and a good sleep the japan australia routes should never be regional,2
a transfer flight via nrt to lax and its cost more than usuall about and their service sucks extremely terrible inflight service the flight attendence keeps knocking restroom door endlessly during you use it and shout loudly even you ask them to wait never experience this terrible service in other airline the headphone in seat is half opened the drinks during the flight is only offered once unlike some other airlines will ask you if you need refill they dont have bilingual annoucnement at laxjust in japanese how can a international flight dont have board cast in multiple languages and you almost can not find their customer service like they dont exist at all tried phone email none reply,1
i couldnt fid my reservation when i tried to manage my booking or even check in online so i called the airline customer service contact and was on hold for hours one time and hours another time with please wait for the next available agent they could have saved us time by saying there are no agents available instead what a waste of time and with no indication if i was flying or not the next day inflight service and food was very good but the website and customer service are both nonexistent and useless,3
great service and michelin grade food most important the toilet is clean even though i could have chosen a direct flight from hkg with other airlines i would rather fly with jal best airline,5
my wife and i choose jal business class night flight from bangkok to tokyo haneda airport because we expect to have good service and some good rest we found the configuration business class seat of jal boeing is quite unexpected the seat configuration is which make the seat not so large we can not make flat bed but rather tilted bed which make us unable to sleep otherwise the service was good and the food was nice we do hope that jal may make some change regarding business seat,3
first experience flying with jal and it was great the food was good seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room plenty of free luggage allowance too xkgcabin bag movie selection offered something for everyone best part about them though is their staff unbelievably helpful always polite and always keen to go above and beyond to help when my travel agent messed up my flights and left me stranded in sydney on my way back jal were the ones to help me find another flight for free even though they had done nothing wrong as quickly as possible top airline all around,5
i traveled with infant and service which they provided was above and beyond i would recommend japan airlines for traveling with infant,5
worst airlines ever staff wasnt bad but the food unbearable and for a hour flight to narita it was just embarrassing you want to call customer service impossible i spent three hours on hold and nothing and then spent another hours on hold and still nothing other than please wait for the next available agent this company will never get my business again or anyone i talk to,1
the check in crew at klia gave confusing information they insist all pass including transit only ones need to have mysos app on the phone to board the guy said this would be checked at gate he also said we needed evisa for transit but another crew told him not to bother nobody checked mysos for transit pass however we and many others at klia had to download the app and fill out the info it requested that took about one extra hour to do jal should retrain the klia local staff cabin crew plane and amenities were great on the plane at nrt we required some first aid and ground staff there took good care of us we had to take another flight which they arranged later that day they were courteous and in view of the pandemic everyone wanted to be extra careful for airline,5
do your homework as to what an airline is expecting you to do prior to international boarding with health requirements as the rules change constantly also may i recommend you try to have at least a hour layover for an international connecting flight my travel was economy class from bostontokyosingapore and was pleasantly surprised with my overall experience even though the bostontokyo flight departed an hour later due to a passengers health issue jals staff was efficient and kept us informed on a regular basis as a matter of fact they were efficient all through the booking process through to departure my connecting flight to singapore was also delayed and i was able to arrive safely,5
wow i booked a trip with this company thru expediataap there was no warning that there is no solo travel right now in japan went to get a refund for he i spent no deal they will not give me a refund what kind of scum bag company is this do not use this company,1
for over years my family and i have flown the aajapan route from dallas to ho chi minh city and we always had a pleasant experience we would book directly with japan airlines however recently this week my parents misread their ticket for pm instead of am when they showed up to the airport they found out that they had missed their flight completely understandable it was their fault that they misread it when they went to the ticket counter for japan airlines at tan son nhat international airport they people there told them that there is nothing that they could do about them missing their flight they would either need to buy a completely brand new ticket or call up whoever they bought the ticket from i explained to them that we bought it from japan airlines they said there is nothing they could do at this time my parents are stuck in vietnam and i am in dallas so i waited for the customer service line to open and called them immediately when i explained to the representative he basically told me that their policies state that since my parents miss their flight they lost their value and they would have to buy a brand new ticket for k each i asked them if there is anything that they could do to help because we do not have k to spend immediately to get my parents back they told me word for word well if you want to get them back to america then you have to pay k completely heartless i understand your policies but i was asking for help because it was something that we could not afford i do not know the average persons affordability but for my family we do not have k to simple drop in a moment i can say without a doubt we will never miss a flight again or ever do any service with japan airlines there are plenty of other airlines out there who will make a connection to asia if i have to eat less to save more money to fly another airline i definitely would i called singapore airlines and they were able to help quickly and reasonably thank you singapore airlines,1
hi japan airlines i would like to share my appreciation for your ticketing agent tomoko i wish i had a better photo of her or it would have been better if i had a photo with her i also hope i got her name correctly tomoko was the agent who attended to me in lax fri at around pm pacific time for the jl flight to manila philippines she was most efficient and demonstrated outstanding customer service she was very genuine in ensuring that i am able to get on that flight and get back home safely to my family i hope this message reaches you tomoko you are so excellent in what you do helping jal customers thank you again for being so awesome i would also like to commend jals inflight wifi i had some work to complete and was able to do so with onboard internet thanks again for the great end to end service i had a great flight back home greatcustomerexperiences jal,5
jal maybe a great airline but if you are flying in their socalled premium economy avoid it bad food bad seating entertaiment was a joke and impossible to sleep i would be better fly emirates and fly economy instead of this even tough its far i would not fly with jal in this class again unless i fly for hell,1
if you actually manage to get onto a flight that has not changed or been cancelled then well done the service onboard is one of the best in the air however if you are one of the countless victims of jals flight changing cancellations or worse you need to contact the call center then it is one of the worst customer experience you will have i had flights to tokyo and then a domestic connection within japan out of the blue i receive an unclear email that states the flights have changed the departure time and date are the same but the arrival times on a direct flight have changed and the connections are now misaligned leaving me stuck the website was not functioning properly and so i was forced to call the call centre during the slim daily window in which they operate this is where the issues started nobody ever answers unfortunately due to the fact that i had a meeting i had to abandon my attempt and getting any information after a mere minutes in the call center queue listening to the same loop of music and the same condescending voice all of our agents are busy please wait for the next available agent or call back later the really galling part is every so often i hear a beep on the line where somebody is there but not answering even though i travel to japan regularly i will really think long and hard before ever choosing jal again they really have let themselves down with their appalling customer service no callback service no estimated wait time nothing,2
jal threw my autistic daughter and wife off the flight after screaming at her to shut up when she didnt want to wear a seatbelt and are currently refusing to pay the legally required compensation their uk help line requires about hours of being on hold each time you call and you end up needing to wait for a callback even for the simplest thing,1
i flew from london heathrow to tokyo haneda due to the closure of russian airspace the flight was slightly longer than usual but even this hour flight was surprisingly pleasant thanks to japan airliness incredible service food and entertainment i am a regular customer with jal and never have i been disappointed the crew were professional polite and helpful the food was more delicious than youd expect from an economy class product on a flight and the selection of entertainment was more than enough to keep you entertained for the flight two full meals and two snacks ice cream and dorayaki this seems to be standard on japan airlines on the other hand the seats are quite firm and perhaps a bit uncomfortable to move around in on a hour flight jal appears to use the same seats on its longest international flights as well as its shorter domestic flightsplenty of legroom though and seats are very wide recline is also somewhat good id definitely recommend japan airlines to you if youre travelling from europe to japan compared to ba and ana that ive also flown with to japan jal seems to be the best in economy class,5
jal has changed my trip without any notice and i could not check any changes on their website my husband had to call on jal call center to get the latest flight information jal gave us a hour layover in vancouver airport instead of hours as before and also another transit airport between halifax and vancouver with more than waiting hours in toronto the call center guy of jal in north america also has a very negative attitude when checking flights or options for us he asked me to call westjet to check and changed flights instead of working himself however we are not wetjets customers we pay the whole trip money to jal the call center guy told me that how do i know if i do not try to call westjet after calling him i did call westjet but wetjet could not help and asked me to contact jal again i did fly with my international airlines but its the first time i had a very negative experience i had with jal i would not recommend this airline to anyone its my honest review for jal,1
the zipair assistant changed our ticket to thailand instead of vietnam and told us where we could buy a new one to our original destination we got stuck in the airport because i need a visa to get out of the airport we ended up buying another tickets coming back from thailand and getting stuck in the airport for hours we couldnt fly t another country because nobody accepts passengers from a cheap airline like zipair neveeeeeer fly with this airline its a waste of time and money they ignore your emails and calls and dont care if they made a mistake they just want your money,1
how times and airlines have changed a few years ago jal was our favourite international airline we are booked on a jal premium economy return flight from sydney to paris in a few weeks which requires a hour overnight layover at the haneda airport hotel airside this was the only connection available we started to get concerned when we read that due to covid japan was not issuing any tourist visas unless in a group or even transit visas the japanese consulate in australia has confirmed this is the case and as we must pass immigration to get to the airport hotel metres away we will be denied entry into japan so what to do some travellers suggest sleeping in the airport waiting area some banks of seats have no arms so stretch out they say however that definitely wasnt an attractive or an acceptable option we are way past sleeping on airport benches or floors notwithstanding we now understand that a new development is airport staff are now shutting down the airport late at night again due to covid concerns and kick everyone out to where cant enter japan cant stay at the airport cant go back to the plane as most jal customers know and despite japans customary politeness and civility etc the airlines customer service is practically nonexistent certainly there is no capacity to email the airline i waited two hours on the phone only to be addressed by someone who didnt want to be there and had absolutely no interest in the issues i was trying to resolve i achieved nothing and was left with a feeling that the airline was happy to keep my flight payments knowing full well that i would be left in nomans land at haneda airport unable to go anywhere bottom line is that in my view jals behaviour has been unconscionable the airline hasnt even had the decency to contact us and no doubt all the other transit passengers on the flight and offer alternatives i will cancel my flight and fight the a for people cancellation fee that jal will impose it is clear that jal has little interest in the current unsolvable issue their only flight connection has created for its transit passengers,1
we had our tickets booked from new delhi to los angeles on the airlines for th august via make my trip the airline cancelled the flight and refused to accommodate any request for an exchange from mumbai to los angeles on the same date very poor service and compliance this was less than one month before travel,1
japan airlines is the worst airline that i have ever attempted to work with i booked tickets for my honeymoon with jal they cancelled one leg of a leg journey and refused to transfer me to the other flight that worked with the existing itinerary the only option they provided was for me to depart hours earlier still arriving on the same day due to the horrible layovers with their alternative itinerary obviously i chose to cancel the flight and booked another trip with singapore air at time of cancellation they told me id be receiving a full refund months later im still waiting on my refund while writing this im hours into waiting on hold on their customer service line so that i can figure out when theyre going to return my captive as far as i can tell sitting on hold is the only way to get in contact with jal i have and will continue to advise everyone i know to avoid this airline like the plague andrew bitzko,1
i took the early morning am flight from bangkok to tokyo narita i arrived at the airport at around am before check in opened at am i lined up for the first class check in line based on oneworld emerald status eventhough i was booked in business class the line was not moving as the first passenger in line seemed to have a complicated issue that took a lot of time so one of the business class counters took over checking in those in the first class line i had reserved seat a which is a window seat in the first row of business class on check in i was told the seat had a problem with the partition between the window seat and the aisle seat and that it could not move up all the way as the flight was pretty full and i was pretty sure all the window seats were taken already i said i was fine with my seat business and first passengers can use the priority lane security entrance on the main floor and did not have to go up one floor to go through security like the other passengers i was quickly past security and passport control and in the sakura lounge at suvarnabhumi airport instead of the usual self serve buffet sakura lounge is now on an order system where you go up to staff and order your food items or drinks at the meal counter you could order chicken curry donburi set sausage and egg set salad corn soup japanese gozen or fried chicken more than enough food and plenty of choices for breakfast service as usual for jal was very efficient there is a lot of seating in the lounge and plastic dividers have been placed between seats for covid protection the flight boarded on time on boarding i discovered the partition between my seat and seat b was completely taped down in the open position so that there was no privacy at all from seat b i went up to the purser to mention this as it was a different situation than checkin had explained to me after checking briefly the purser came back to me to offer a seat in first class instead since this flight did have a small first class section with seats and there was a single unoccupied seat business class is configured xx and first class is configured xx the first class seat was much more spacious than the business class seat with neat storage compartments all around the seat and a foot rest that could double as a second seat for a companion to have a join meal in the seat the first class seat had beautiful wood trim all around a very large video screen and a shelf under the video monitor that can move toward the seat as a large table there is also ample storage space under the food rest for a carry on bag on this medium haul flight the toiletries bag and menu were the same in first and business class and only the blanket was different with first having a warmer textured blanket service as always on jal was excellent lunch was served during the flight and i selected the japanese meal with the bento box of various starters followed by soup rice and the duo of mains of grilled flatfish miso yuan style and grilled pork saikyo style it was delicious filling and visually extremely appealing i have always enjoyed my jal flights and this one was no exception an upgraded super comfortable wide seat excellent food and service another great flight experience,5
i definitely expected a lot more from jal my mom was on the flight from ny jfk to seoul skorea and had the connection in haneda jal canceled the flight without any reason no weather or problem with the plane and let my mom know at the boarding gate she checked in her bags already and was waiting for her flight and was notified that her connecting flight was canceled and the one that they booked for her was now hours overnight stay at the airport when i got on the phone with customer service they told me the flight was canceled days ago but they did not send us any email regarding the changes to the flight they refused to get her any hotel or meal to compensate for the changes to the flight my mom is years old does not speak japanese or english and is now stuck at the airport for hours without any help from the airline absolutely ridiculous experience and will never take jal ever again,1
jal is usually one of the best airlines in the world ive flown several times in business and also first class wonderful but now after flying a round trip with them to jakarta and back i wouldnt be very excited to fly them until japan changes its quarantine rules for tourists every single jal flight was delayed both to and from usa and to and from asia this isnt really jals fault the japanese govt isnt allowing jal to leave a single passenger in narita overnight so if even one connecting flight from jfkordlaxsfosanseayvrdfw is delayed then all of the connections to bkkcgksinkulmnlhan are delayed so that every single passenger gets on their connecting flight same thing on the way back to usa my delays were sfonrt min delay nrtcgk hours delay cgknrt not delayed nrtsfo hour delay causing me to miss my connection from sfo to jfk in addition the intraasia flights on the features slanted beds in business class not flat which is not competetive with the other airlines garuda singapore air malaysia air cathay ana lastly jal weirdly serves only a tiny snack after take off on the hour flight cgknrt which departs at am hours into the flight the main meal is served i hadnt eaten anything before the flight because i like everyone else on the plane right got up at am got to the airport about am went through immigration and customs etc before boarding at am when were we expected to eat i wish id have known this ahead of time ummmm also i tried calling jals usa number at least times before the trip began and busy busy busy busy ridiculous pro seat and food on in business class on the er for sfonrt and return was excellent,2
my first flight from del to haneda was with economy class it was very uncomfortable no leg space at all food was japanese style and very limited the service wasnt the best as well when i landed in haneda i asked to upgrade to economy seat with more leg room for my next flight first of all the language barrier is a huge issue i have been told all leg room seats are reserved and i had no choice to pay more for economy premium the seats in economy premium are okay i cant say they are that comfortable but i got enough leg space you also get a small bag with some goodies for the rest of your flight food was okay not better than regular economy my main issue was that i saw a lot of unreserved leg room seats in economy so i dont understand why i was been told that they are sold out my experience with ana was definitely much better,3
i cant say enough obout this airline after getting canceled and ran around by delta we finally got rebooked on jal going from seattle to manila their economy seats are better than delta premium comfort the food is better i wish id known about jal prior ill use jal anytime i get the opportunity they earned my money with their customer service and amenities thank you jal this should be the industry standard finally a company that actually cares about their customers on my connection to another airline they had a rep to personally escort us to the next flight so we wouldnt miss it amazing service even if it is more expensive its worth every penny,5
tried to get a hold of customer service by phone for three days straight to make changes with my flight after booking online with no luck as far as the the flights themselves that i had i had a great experience with the cleanliness of the plan the service received from the flight attendants and the food that was served was much better than most other airlines i have had better entertainment choice on other airline flying similar routes in the air star experience on the ground star experience,3
flown to japan round trip with my wife about a dozen times using jal pretty consistently good service food overall experience in this regard on this last return flight to san diego the vast majority of travelers were foreigners non japanese upon landing the head flight attendant walked around and personally thanked the handful of japanese travelers including my wife but no one else she spoke japanese which i understand i thought that an odd business practice and one which id guess did not escape notice by other nonjapanese as well again overall service was satisfactory but i think the time has come to retire this business practice poor judgement in my opinion,3
bad customer service not able to help much please dont use them if need any customer service cannot communicate in english,1
my parents and i are on vacation to attend my brothers graduation in canada we are now required to look for alternatives on our own because jal cancelled our flight to malaysia a couple of days prior to our flight due to it being an overnight transit they are not assisting with alternatives and the only compensation they offer is a refund which is not immediate please purchase your flight tickets with caution do not purchase any flights with longovernight transit through japan and do not purchase with jal unless you are absolutely sure the purchase does not require you to reach out for jals customer service in any way also i am uncertain as to why the lady who called needed to ask for my family members names even the one who isnt flying but just in case the information is going to be used for malicious intentions i have gone through the trouble of recording the second half of our phone call in case nobody was recording it,1
after hours of calling their customer service i was not connected to a customer representative their website does not allow changing ticket horrible airline pay few hundred dollar more to flight with another airline will save you lots of time and work,1
my trip to jakarta had flights service and the flight attendants were uniformly excellent although their english skills were limited first time that ive found that limitation on a bilingual flight the film offerings were few and rarely tempting on the first flight had i been a tall size woman the seating area would have felt cramped but it was private and the seat reclined well on the second leg however the seat was not private but more like a reclining economy seat the major problem was the seat itself fully reclined it was like lying on a slant board my feet almost on the ground uncomfortable to say the least bad for circulation on both flights the design was not thought through with little perching space for personal items and food service at the same time i was spoiled by my turkish airline business class experience last year,3
maha at japan airlines at dfw was able to easily switch me to another flight they anticipated what i need and i appreciate that so much,5
japan airlines has good cabin crew but other than that good luck to you if something goes wrong with your booking their customer service is nonexistent all you get is a busy tone and people at the ticketing gate are the worst no compassion whatsoever one lady from their group tried to help me and only because she felt bad because i am traveling with a baby they dont smile at all i got left behind because the ticket number that my infant was assigned to was incorrect it was an easy fix to think about it because it was a lap infant ticket but i was left behind with my kids and worst is that i got stranded on my second leg meaning i had to buy tickets to get back home i have kids with me a five yo and a yo they are so heartless even if it was purchased thru a rd party booker they should still help or atleast try to help their passengers because it is still their product never flying jal ever again love their cabin crew but other than that its a rating of zero it was a nightmare one of the worst days of my lifethanks to japan airlines,1
lack of customer responsibility unethical opposite of what japan is known for i was not able to fly from seattle to malaysia because i have hours layover and i was not allowed to go to and i was not given any notice about i tried calling emailing and all kinds of ways to reach them and i had no answers weeks before my flight they just hang up the phone each time called narita airport and they said i was good to go when i got to seattle they do not let me board the plane and do not help me get another their staff were rude and was yelling at me like it was my mistake i hope this airline get shut down some day,1
where do i start customer service is awful from inquiries to checkin i cant tell if its communication barrier rudeness lack of confidence with employees to communicate properly with customers or they just dont care plane i dont understand how jal was rated a star airlines in all categories this should be a star airlines toothpicks were all around my seat area my seat area was dirty uncleaned jal prides itself on cleaniness its far from it i will advise that you get your personal clorox wipes handy headphone jack was screwed up i literally had to use books to support the headphone plugin to watch movies usb port was nonfunctional in my seat location to be honest once i observed the attitudes the communication experience with jal employees i simply ignored everything around me including the flight attendants and more focused on getting to my destination home never will i make a mistake to book with this airline food it was pathetic a joke for business class i watched some youtube videos before making a reservation the talk of food flight experience seems stellar be careful about recommendations of those youtubers wait till you have the real experience it was awful lounge the sakura lounge at narita airport was decent clean some food options the meal i ordered was ok the corn soup was good i didnt interact much with the lounge staff due to covid protocols but i did say thank you in japanese most responded politely however the lounge experience doesnt transfer to the inflight experience overall an awful experience for my roundtrip flight,1
covid significantly changes various aspects in our lives i understand that businesses are in the process of recovering from the impact of covid however it does not mean that an airline can create an itinerary that customer absolutely cant travel and push all responsibilities over to booking agents my family and i booked a flight to travel from jfk to sgn japan airline offers flights from jfk to nrt then from hnd to sgn we went with jal instead of ana because of shorter layover less than hr before departing we received a courtesy call telling us that we must cancel this flight and work with our book agent for a different path because of the covid restrictions in japan we had asked for assistance since we had contacted jal in the past and none of the calls were successful the average wait time is hrs theres no call back options our agent tried to contact jal but waiting from pm to pm and never got a response when we arrived at the airport the staffs completely ignored us and others who are on the same boat we had to go back to our agent to book a flight for the next day in such challenging period working together to find a solution is much more effective than denying responsibility selling a flight that no one could possibly fly is unethical a reasonable person would believe in the airlines arrangements while preparing necessary documents such as proof of negative pcr result in response to the current environment that we are in its the airline responsibility to offer fly itinerary that would take their customers to where they need to be,1
bought a rt ticket for my mother but the returning flight was cancelled and changed by jalfrom less than hour trip to hours trip i called jal their unwillingness to help really frustrated us they basically want their customer to just deal with it wait in the airport for hours cant go out to stay in the hotel and no resting area in the airport they let their customer to purchase tickets online and then subsequently cancelchange the flightsbe careful with jal yes they offered the refund for the returning flight but its less than or what i paid is not even enough to cover the oneway ticket if i were to know this id never purchased jal,1
i have not travelled yet but i already have bad experience with flight change two days ago i received cancellation email for frankfurt to narita leg of the flight from helsinki to sydney they moved me to the earlier date effectively killing the helsinki to frankfurt leg so change of flight was done with disregard to my itinerary worst thing is helsinki to frankfurt leg being operated by finnair but still booked through jal and paid for later they moved haneda to sydney leg for later day increasing our layover by hours and one more thing change the terminal from narita to haneda seems not possible with current government regulations but the system let that booking through so looks like we are in trouble now have to ask for refund for return to sydney flight two hours on hold calling the australian contact number still not getting through what a nightmare,1
i reserved a day round trip with jal but missed some connections on the first leg of the trip and had to book a flight with another carrier to get to jakarta days later i showed up for my flight home stood in line for an hour only to be told that because i didnt board those earlier flights jal had canceled my reservation without any notice and without any refund and resold my seat to someone else all the while jal continued to send me email notifications about my upcoming flight even as i was being told by their employees that i was booted jal does not allow online checkin at least not with international flights during covid so without any notification from jal there was no way for me to know i would be stranded in jakarta i submitted a complaint to the company on the website but never received any response i picked jal for my trip because they have a lot of glowing reviews but this was such a rotten experience i will never recommend them to anyone and if at all possible will avoid booking with them in the future,1
the flight my husband and i took from haneda in april were filled with four or five families with kids infants or teenagers which was usually a bad sign here is a list of the pet peeves we had on this flight journey have you checked which seat you are going to occupy properly we reserved isle seats for both of us my husband to be seated in the seat in front of me in the row c and myself behind him when we arrived at the seats my husband noticed that his seat was already occupied by someone else who was seated with his families and had to tell this guy that he was occupying my husbands seat in error this family guy moved to the window seat and my husband was seated in the designated isle seat some people just assume where they are sitting but there are always some people who reserve certain seats for reasons mind your kids and their behaviour looking at three seats in deg on the same number row across the isle from my seat c were occupied by a woman with two infants they were the main cause of the nightmare on the entire journey two daughters who were assumingly and years old were either bawling or screaming constantly the noise got worse with seat tray banging and lamp flickering by the kids and their mother had no intention of controlling their behaviour they also trashed around their food debris and litters constantly on the floor did anyone see the amount of rubbish they produced for the entire flight journey at one point i saw the woman changing one of the kids nappies on the seat another time she was checking the content of the nappy by pulling down the pants of the daughters while food was being served be considerate to other fellow passengers my husbands sleep was constantly disturbed by a family of five who were seated next to him occupying over two rows of seats who often kept walking back and forth to get snacks situated at the breakout area the father figure of the family tried to cross over my husbands legs while he was asleep unfortunately he wasnt slim enough to squeeze himself out of the narrow space left and knocking off the a bottle of water left in the seat pocket situated at my husbands seat hence waking him up with a loud din opt out of codeshare flight it seems that the flight we took from hnd to lhr was a codeshare flight with ba though we originally purchased the option with jal only so in a way we ended up paying more than these ba passengers would have paid i personally have never had good experience with codeshare flight with ba and this flight has proved it once again the speed of serving airline food is it necessary that the passengers simply get fed with airline food in a hurried manner with less than minutes when we get served with a main meal a pot of ice cream gets served at the same time why for someone who has delicate digestive system consuming ice cream straight after the main meal does cause an issue but i do like ice cream and can only indulge myself in this when i do have good appetite mostly i dont especially prior to the flight so i tend to skip it nowadays but i really would like jal to stop feeding passengers like a herd of cattle the level of service during the pandemic and post pandemic i was fortunate enough to fly back to japan once with jal during the pandemic outbreak before the lockdown and more tight restriction on the overseas travelling and on that flight there were just about passengers on board we in the economy class were treated almost like vips and cabin attendants were so attentive and even thanked each passenger for choosing jal to travel on this codeshare flight back to the lhr i felt being part of cattle class having to put up with noise smells and litters on the entire flight journey i am sure there are many reasons or occasions why kids have to accompany their parents on the flight journeys but when they do i urge the parents to take care of their kids so as not to cause any nuisance or disturbances to other passengers i also feel that airlines should manage better seat allocation befitting each flight situation for instance families with small kids should be seated in family friendly allocated seat location and other passengers can choose seats away from them if they wish,2
booked a flight with a layover at tokyo jal cancelled the last leg of the trip and put us on a flight that leave tokyo on the next day then they called us two days before the trip and told us we cant stay overnight at the tokyo airport due to covid restriction but they were the one who cancelled our flight and put us on a flight that leaves the next day our initial booking does not have an overnight layover told us theres no other alternatives and does not respond to refund request and does not pick up the phone worst airline ever,1
i booked a trip to london about a month ago to fly out in july with japan airlines never flown with them before but figured id give them a shot two nights ago they emailed me saying theyve cancelled my flights for no reason and put me on a different flight i tried calling their contact line the next day after five hours of being on hold the call disconnected times finally got through they couldnt give me a reason for the cancellation told me the only flight i can get will cut my trip short days and add another h of travel and layover each way or my other option was a refund minus tax to be in my account in months refused to give me paper trail of the refund request i just have to trust it will show up in weeks do not fly with japan airlines,1
i booked two business class seats in september for travel in june sydney to london return in april jal informed me that two of the legs were now cancelled they offered no alternative for one of the legs and the other leg they offered a connecting flight days after the first leg go figure in the end i had to cancel my flights and rebook with another airline at greater cost i will never use jal again having spoken to others it appears this is common practice with jal beware what was once a premium airline is no more,1
after two failed attempts at the start of covid to fly with jal i finally was able to do this trip in business class i can say it was well worth the wait i have flown other oneworld partners but i have to say that jal is my favourite and it will be my first choice when i fly again in the future the friendly and attentive service from the flight attendants was exceptional and their attention to detail was no exception you can see the pride in each and every jal representative i would highly recommended their business class product when travelling long haul thank you for a wonderful experience,5
still no response despite posting on very public social media sites they obviously dont care about their customers lets show them by avoiding them in the future terrible airline wheres my refund jal cancelled one of my business class return flights from sydney to london and now say i have to wait weeks for a refund wtf never again will i book this airline no wonder they went bust years ago,1
we booked business class to london with jal despite a long wait for a connection in tokyo with one week before departure they cancelled one of our return flights which resulted in us having to totally cancel our plans now they are making us wait weeks for our refund which means we cannot fly anywhere until we get our money back the entire exercise has been a waste of time and i hate to think how they treat their economy passengers i cannot recommend jal to anyone its not surprising they went bust years ago theyre heading the same way again,1
very polite staff everything was organized nice food lots of options for drink knowledgeable crew,5
for several days now i have been trying to reach jal customer service to amend my return travel dates but have not succeeded i called on different days and at different times on every occasion i was put on hold by the recorder for almost hours and i was so frustrated and angry that i couldnt wait any longer i am a skyteam member and i chose jal from many other carriers thinking that they are major airlines with customer service awareness and reliable aftersales support however it seems that i was totally wrong disappointed nerve breaking and made a bad choice in flying jal i would not recommend jal to anyone with a flexible flying schedule as they will be disappointed as i was,2
this is the least trustworthy airline or company for that matter that i have ever had the misfortune of using i have been on the phone a total now of ten hours on hold to get a refund for the ticket japan airlines canceled they canceled the flight i did not when i finally got through to them the representative i spoke with told me she didnt know how to process a refund and said another representative would call me back i was called back late in the evening did not pick up and so received a voicemail this is japan airlines we will only call you this once you will have to call us back to find out about your refund they still have my money i still have no ticket do not travel with japan airlines,1
they dont have any option of india meal if you flying from india you should have indian meal even in narita tokiyo airport i dont not find a burger or sandwich all the choices they have japnese i am not expecting for india food not a even international foor burger piza and sandwich i never use their services again and recomend any international pessangers to visit there because they dont have to any option to eat i dont eat any thing in flight and also nothing to eat in the airport thats totally bad experience,1
extremely rude and unpleasant staff in narita airport i have a ridiculous hour layover no one was willing to help me or offer me vouchers a hotel stay or to change my ticket the woman helping me named kobayashi took my ticket and refused to return it to me she rudely handed me a blank sheet of paper when i asked for an official form stating jals policy or lack of regarding long layovers she mocked me in japanese to her colleagues she was extremely rude i never want to fly jal again with staff like this,1
i have been to japan three times on jal always lax to kix in business class and have always found the service both on the ground and in the air and the food to be really great the seats were comfortable and the in flight entertainment always had something worth watching and things were clean and orderly,5
i never thought that this company would leave my son abandoned in an airport for more than hours no sleep no food not a single bottle of water a shame where is the fame of japanese companies warning in case you are looking for a flight to japan a disaster,1
three days in a row ive called jal customer service and failed to connected today i waited minutes and then it seemed to pick up but call ended also no response from online message sent through jals contact us tab,1
photos of in flight meals and menu lounge food posted separately i transited in narita to fly to bangkok on japan airlines as my incoming flight to narita was early i had time to use the first class lounge in the main terminal the only jal lounge open at narita it did mean a bit of a walk each way as my arriving flight and my departing flight were both in the satellite terminal the lounge has lots of seating and a large eating area on the second floor of the lounge food is now ordered by scanning a qr code at each table and is quickly delivered to your seat all the tables have every other seat blocked and the counter seats have plastic dividers between seats for pandemic safety and distancing i ordered some salmon fusilli and steamed vegetables and each was delivered to my seat beautifully plated on a huge plate on an even larger platter i also ordered some of the trademark made to order sushi from the sushi counter where you can see sushi chefs making sushi and again the sushi plate was delivered on a large platter therefore just three dishes and i was running out of room on my table already all of the food was delicious i boarded my flight to bangkok on schedule the flight is operated with a b dreamliner and was about half full in business class seats are configured xx with seats staggered slightly so window seats have direct aisle access as well there is a lot of larger and smaller shelf space on two sides of the window seat so lots of places to put laptoptablet phones glasses drinks the seat converts to a fully flat bed and was comfortable and quite spacious in bed position on this flight unlike the flight from vancouver to narita also operated with the same kind of plane the front toilet was not blocked for use by flight and cabin crew so there were toilets available for use by business class passengers the flight was an evening flight scheduled for hours minutes but in reality about hours long so instead of a full toiletries case as is provided on full long haul flights a small cloth pouch was provided with the basics toothbrush eye mask ear plugs and moisture mask a unique jal feature where you wear it over your mouth and nose and insert in wet sheets to increase moisture in the air you breathe service on the flight was exceptional cabin crew always took time to say a few extra words that created an exceptionally friendly environment jal service is always excellent but on this particular flight the cabin crew took it up another level yet initially there were some issues with the entertainment system and the system on my seat and the empty seat next to me both did not work cabin crew came by a couple of times to help and in the end restarted the whole system to fixed the issue food was divine on the flight as it was catered out of japan not only is the food delicious but it is presented in such a beautiful and refined way that your taste buds already won over when the bento box for appetizers or dish for mains arrives at your seat as always the jal menu includes a page describing the special coffee that is served in business class on that flight this time it was not a favourite as it was a lighter roast with more acidity than i like but nevertheless it is always interesting to see what special coffee would be served on my jal flight the flight arrived about minutes early at around pm i passed through the thailand pass checkpoint and immigration and had picked up my checked luggage by pm and was on board the hotel arranged van enroute to the hotel by midnight the application for the thailand pass process was a bit tricky as the application website is finicky requiring you to upload photos of your passport first night test and go hotel booking required travel insurance vaccination record but with limits on the size of the photo files however once i was able to complete the application and submit it i received the approval and the issuance of the qr code with my thailand pass within hours under the test and go system you must book the first night of arrival at an sh hotel and stay in your room until you receive your negative pcr test result from your arrival test i booked the sukhothai bangkok and they were very helpful with information i needed to deal with my thailand pass application and testing process the test and go program requires you to take hotel provided private transportation from the airport to the hotel i was somewhat surprised by the van that sukhothai bangkok provided to take me to the hotel as it was a decked out blingy vip van with changing color lights on the ceiling like a party van nevertheless it got the job done and i arrived safely at the hotel was quickly taken to a nurse on site from the hospital partner of the hotel to take a swab sample for my arrival pcr test and was in my hotel room by around am less than ½ hour after i landed the whole process was relatively stress free and quick an excellent late evening flight with jal very comfortable well pampered with superb service and delicious food,5
one of the best airline service i have received the staff really helped me at honolulu helping me to rebook my flight helping me with my bags when i struggle with the kidsalso great in flight staff would definitely fly again,5
i cannot believe this airline horrible customer service horrific workers please never fly with them i was booked on a flight for june to london from sydney the airline suddenly cancelled the flight and sent us an email to let us know it had been cancelled no information on redirection or refunds were included so we called the airline after waiting on hold for over an hour we got through and the lady on the phone told us we would get a refund in weeks this is not okay they cancelled and then tell us we cannot even have our money back for weeks we need our money to book another flight then after us explaining to her that is not ok and we need the money sooner she hung the phone up on us pathetic absolutely shocked no explanation on the cancellation either this is ridiculous and i will never fly with them again they have lost me as a customer as well the people that i am travelling with,1
one of the worst flight experience bought the ticket online directly from their website as free of charge change initially we were supposed to fly out of lax on feb th but they didnt check us in because one us didnt have travelers insurance not to mention that was not indicated as a requirement to check in when i purchased the tickets and on top of that didnt even bother notify us of such a requirement prior to the flight anyway after spending couple of hours on the phone trying to purchase the insurance we werent able to do so because insurance companies cant issue the insurance on the same day of the flight so we had to reschedule the flight for first available and that was for days later this caused us losing days of our airbnb and our vacation extra expenses and inconvenience back and forth to lax and another for covid test since the test is good only dir hours not to mention that how rude and inconsiderate their staff are at lax airport anyhow at the end of our trip we decided to extend it for few days but when we went to manila airport they said our return ticket was not changeable and that we had to purchase another ticket if we wanted to stay longer i couldnt even believe that because the round trip ticket was purchased as free of charge change but they said only going to manila was changeable category k and return ticket was not changeable category q its hard to believe that none of this was mentioned on the website when i purchased the ticket and on final confirmation that i received it indicated that ticket was purchased as free of charge on changing and it wasnt specified that applies to only for one way this is by far one of the worst airline experience that we have ever had it was our first time taking japan airline and would certainly be the last time their plane are clean but the service and food is horrible not even worth it,1
my flights got cancelled twice in months in the last few weeks before departure it now costs me double to fly because of last minutes booking ill never trust them again,1
i have been flying cathay pacific to hong kong the last couple of years due to the pandemic however since hong kong has a flight ban in place preventing flights from canada and preventing anyone who has been in canada for more than hours in the last days from entering hong kong i flew japan airlines to narita to connect to bangkok and then to wait out the days entry ban before flying on to hong kong flying japan airlines after cathay pacific was quite an upgrade the service is much better and the food is also superior check in opens hours before the flight and i arrived at around am shortly after check in opened check in was already very busy and even in the first class line there was a bit of a wait for an available check in counter to become available this may be due to the need to check each persons extensive documents for whatever destination they were travelling to as i was not entering japan i was not required to comply with japans conditions but staff had to check my thailand pass documents and that took about minutes vancouver airport has reopened the d gates entry since there are now increased flights so it was nice not to have to walk all the way over to the domestic flights entry to go through security and then walk back to the international gates security was a bit slow as there was only one security line open japan airlines business class passengers have use of the plaza premium lounge the lounge was not very busy when i entered which was good as i noticed that one section of the lounge which used to have the hot foods station was closed all food is now provided in the former coffee bar section with sandwiches in the refrigerated cabinet and a small selection of hot foods on the side like mie goreng and butter chicken boarding for jal flight was orderly as usual jal operates a b on the route with seats in business class split between a front section with rows and seats and a back section with rows and seats in a xx configuration the seats are staggered so every seat has direct aisle access i love the window seat as in addition to the window it has a large shelf right under the video screen that has enough space to put a small laptop or a tablet and a narrow shelf along the side of the seat to put my phone and glasses the seat is the sky suite which i like quite a bit as it is quite roomy and enclosed by a head level partition which affords a lot of privacy in bed position the seat has great length so my feet did not even need to reach the shelf section under the video screen that is the last section of the seat in bed position shoulder space is also very good as both armrests lower down flat with the seat in bed position although the aisle side armrest is quite hard and not comfortable to rest my arm or elbow on in bed position there is plenty of storage space as in addition to the overhead bin there is a small shelf behind my seat for miscellaneous items and space for a carry on bag under the video screen the tray table pops out from the side of the seat and can swing out so i can exit my seat without putting the table away though requiring a bit of manoeuvring on my part to do so out of the seats in the front section were occupied so it was not too full the seat beside mine was empty so i could keep the partition between my window seat and the aisle seat down unless i wanted more privacy when it is time to sleep cabin crew will help put out the bedding which consists of a thick mattress pad and a light blanket the mattress bed completely eliminates any feel of the ridges in the seat where it folds in seat position and makes for a very comfortable bed to sleep on this flight had the magic entertainment system which is quite an upgrade from earlier jal in flight entertainment systems with a lot more choices of movies in multiple languages from multiple countries service on the flight is as always with jal superb very attentive but discreet and refined everything is done meticulously even a glass is carefully placed with the jal logo facing you toilets are always neat and tidy as the cabin crew are constantly cleaning it after passenger use food is a highlight on jal flights i almost always choose the japanese meal for the appetizer bento box with multiple sections featuring a variety of delectable and beautiful bite sized eats you start enjoying your meal even before you taste it as the presentation is always so beautiful and again meticulous meal service consists of lunchdinner served after take off and then a snack served hours before landing one unique feature of the jal in flight menu is the page describing the special coffee of the month for the flight jal features different specially selected coffees and gives a description with tasting notes as one would normally find with wines throughout the flight cabin crew were constantly going through the cabin looking for any passenger service needs and as soon as i finish a drink or a snack cup noodle cabin crew would very soon after notice this and remove the item the flight arrived more than an hour early passengers are requested to remain in their seat after the plane reached its gate as japan has specific procedures to deboard international transit passengers first before then deboarding passengers who are entering japan and must go through the arrival covid test procedure we lost about half an hour after disembarking from the plane as they had to wait for all transit passengers to be accounted for and they kept counting and counting and could not get to the correct count eventually all the lined up transit passengers were allowed to exit the gate and head to the international transit station once there passing through security was quick and then i was into the departures section and able to go to the lounge to await my connecting flight to bangkok the jal flight is very enjoyable with the service and food being particular highlights arrival and transit procedures at narita airport are orderly and generally very quick and efficient as the japanese are famous for if you have to fly somewhere that jal can fly to you should definitely consider jal for your flight and you do not need to worry about transiting and connecting at narita airport,5
i flew jal return to and from canada twice in and every person i encountered of their crew was kind and patient while dealing with the numerous issues travelling with covid causes staff both onboard and in the terminal were professional and efficient on my return i also had to rebook my flight within hours of it leaving due to a positive covid diagnosis the customer service representatives were polite and helpful each time i called times this experience has made me want to choose jal every time i fly they also fly pets which is a huge plus,5
i got delayed due to a blizzard this happens it is out of everyones control but they way they handled my ticket was deplorable i was rebooked onto a very tight connection then of course the first leg was delayed and i missed my connection as soon as the first leg was delayed i asked to be moved to a later connection and was told over and over again that it would be taken care of at the next airport in the air i again asked about it and begged to be given a seat on the next connection snd was told not to worry that someone on the ground would assist we landed and it was about minutes before the next flight and i was ignored by all of the gate agents and ground agents for so long that by the time someone finally looked at what i needed the next connecting flight had already left during the time i could have been making that connection i was helplessly watching the ground agents laugh with each other instead of helping me the next available flight they could book me on was hours later all of my friends flying a different airline ana made it home without any of these issues i will never fly jal again,1
kudos to all fas keep it up the excellent service staff were all accommodating they make sure to check back on us how our doing,5
yoday i recieved an email ftom japan airlines that they have preponed our haneda delhi flight to th may the flight now dhall lesve at am on th may i along with my wife are flying from dallas to haneda on th may snd shall reach haneda at hrs as such its not technically possible to catch delhi bound flight on th may i wanted to get in touch with japan airlines on their only customer service number in us ie but no one is lifting the call despite wsiying for even hours no other us number is available on the site surprisingly no email id is given where one can drop an email the phone number given while booking the tickets was of india which is no longer available wonder how jal is going to connect with me airlines should have shown some common sense by preponing both the travel legs even on their website in manage booking the system is throwing error and not displaying any information very poor services,1
im a frequent flyer and have flown japan air for a number of years thus far was well treated till i checked in for a flight to singapore last dec from dfw the ground staff natsuko k was impatient and rude in handling the process she rejected both of my covid tests without proper verifications one of the tests was a naat test similar to pcr test taken at albertson and the other was a pcr test as well from a recognized clinic here in dfw except that part of the standard form they used was handwritten i even had the medical prof on the call for natsuko to verify the test result but she refused i felt being discriminated against for no reason i was refused boarding and had to go take another covid test thats ridiculous according the med professional at the third clinic those two earlier tests were already valid pcr tests later i called my embassy who told me those tests should be accepted as well apparently she did not seem to be competent for the job even though she claimed to be a ground manager i believe she reports to tomoko t jal you need to review and take adequate action to prevent her from tarnishing the reputation of japan air i actually called jal support few times days before my departure to get more details about the covid test requirements but they have no clue later i decided to take the test twice just to be sure but they were both turned down for no reason,1
i fly japan airlines across the pacific whenever possible especially eastbound as the times and jet lag effects work well for me crossings in the last years on the same er configured aircraft each time tyolax there are fancier and more private first class seats in the air but the service and food set japan airlines apart and i enjoy the interaction over the multicourse wine paired meals if you are lucky some hibiki yr then ill sleep on a bed prepared just for me when i wake the large bathroom is cleaned after each person i think and i have a light meal and a fruit plate,5
very comfortable best in class legroom i was really impressed with the quality of service if you arrive when the ticket counter opens in the morning the staff stands in line and bows to greet the customers they are very friendly and went the extra mile to print the documents that i needed upon arrival the food that is offered is delicious they offer japanese staple foods and drinks which i enjoy,5
dont use gotogate they didnt refund over dollar on october th i bought a roundtrip ticket with japan airlines because the covid prr test views were one hour late i couldnt board the plane call the agent and she gave me one that cant be used no one answered the phone number and no one answered the call on her japan airlines phone in our company she said she could not help me change the ticket and needed japan airlines to help change the ticket now if you mind canceling this ticket buy it again i listen in response to her opinion she bought a roundtrip ticket on october she said that her company is very busy and it takes a few weeks to refund me the ticket on october in midnovember i got the money for a ticket refund its not a roundtrip ticket i called them and its hard to answer the phone today i answered the phone and said that their company needs to cancel the fee us dollars the rest of the money is deducted by the japanese company they asked me to contact japan airlines i called they told japan airlines that they would not deduct customer cancellation fees during the epidemic they asked me to contact the agency and i contacted the agency the agency said they could send me an email to prove that they wanted me to call japan airlines to not deduct the deduction during the epidemic for customers cancellation fees i called japan airlines to ask japan airlines that they changed their terms and said that they had deducted the cancellation fees now they are all playing games with covid the final victim is our consumption you not law asking them cancellation feewhat i will never use japan airlines again i hope gotogate will close down soon i also hope that the government can rectify this blackhearted travel agency,1
i was really impressed with the quality of service if you arrive when the ticket counter opens in the morning the staff stands in line and bows to greet the customers they are very friendly and went the extra mile to printdocuments which i needed upon arrival the food that is offered is delicious they offer japanese staple foods and drinks which i enjoy not that is impacts the experience but i really love the uniforms they wear the women are dressed in black suits with red and white scarves that look so nice,5
we were very well served by miss matsumoto and rest of the staff she was very polite and helpful towards my parents and other passengers would recommend,5
on jal f class today dec from hnd to jfk and honestly i think the dining on jal is simply worth every memory i chose the western meal curated by tokyo quintessence michelin stars chef and it was superb even the bread tasted so different fully cream flavour and excellent texture salon champagne and jyuyondai sake probably brought the experience to another level simply think the experience is just worth the memories for years to come will like to also highlight the great service delivered by both hara and nagano onboard this flight both of them took great care and hospitality throughout the flight ms nagayama on jl sinhnd dec also provided great service and hospitality throughout my flight on the business class,5
i will never fly jal again long story but brief version the check in people issued us all boarding passes after a very long check in on leaving to departure s they stopped me and took back my boarding passes and covid tests they li said we couldnt fly because our certificates were not complete they were issued by a top level pcr testing lab in tokyo with english translation fully certified they lied and said hk and cathay would not allow us to fly to hk after about an hour of mounting tension and stress i called cathay myself to find out why they blocked us cathay rep said we were all clear to fly to hk and into sydney i gave the phone to jal supervisor they ran around with radios etc boarding time was by then only minutes away luggage still at the counter this had now been over two hours at the jal counter with hungry kids and we were wiped out after months of planning and packing for a complete international move covid complications quarantine vaccines testing relocation planning etc etc this was the only cluster we had after months of meticulous planning with all contingencies forecast except gross incompetence with an airline check in they finally emerged waving four papers we could sign and board now minutes before take off we quickly signed including kids we were totally stressed as our onward plans had multiple things set up including vehicle deliveries lots of accommodations visiting plans for aged sick family in care all teetering on our correct arrival time it turns out the papers were to indemnify jal from us suing them for damages losses etc i quickly read the paper as we were leaving disgusted but too stressed and worried about getting on the plane we left i wrote my concerns the jal got a polite reply and guarantee they would investigate they did but the staff obviously lied again and no remedy offered the report sent had clear omissions and false statements we were deprived of the use of the lounge stressed to the point if melt down yet these clown think its fine i love japan and can say this was the first time in years of living in japan that japanese people lied and lied and lied again to me shame shame shame,1
one of the better experiences in flying economy class that i have had especially the food that little effort goes along way,5
hardly speak english very hard to communicate with my daughter was sleeping and was told no good will be served in the flight i till hours later and have to eat at airport lounge i told them i need any sandwiches for my daughter when she wakes up totally ignored my request for my surprise saying sorry nothing we can do really not happy,2
we booked a flight to thailand through jal for a trip in dec jal cancelled a connecting flight due to covid making the trip impossible offered no alternative so we requested a refund just as they state on their website jal refuses to respond after weeks of requests this is the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my life they take your money do not provide the service promised and just keep your money i will never fly jal again worst company no wonder they needed a government bailout,1
i cannot thank japan airlines enough for flying me home during covid they are probably the only airline who didnt cancel economy seats to prioritise first class their service was incredible and i would chose them over any other airline,5
hello i booked the ticket with american airlines and selected my seats early on to ensure i had a comfortable flight when the day came i did not have the seats because the flight was being operated by japan airlines they did not honor my choices and placed me by the bathroom on a hour flight in a half empty plane one i did not appreciate being by a smelly and dirty bathroom especially in times of covid user beware do not book flights to asia with american airlines if they put you on a japan airlines flight odds are you will end up next to a filthysmelly bathroom since you did not book through them to begin with and yes it stunk the whole way i am never buying a japan airlines ticket i wasnt even given the option to pay for an upgrade,2
extremely disappointed jal is only half of this disappointment i booked my tickets through mytrip and they just kept passing me around jal cancelled my inbound flights less than days before im supposed to depart with no alternative flights provided while i clearly see other flights available online when i search its almost like they want you to cancel and get a refund so youre forced to purchase the more expensive fares the issue is still not resolved but i ended up booking a oneway return which was more expensive than my entire ticket i made sure i booked directly with the airline and not jal it takes at least hours to get to someone on the phone and i made phone calls to them this isnt the first time i booked through an online travel agency with cancelled flights but this is the first time ive had this issue book this airline at your own risk if something goes wrong youre on your own and youre basically throwing your money away unless you buy the refundable fares good luck id stay away from this airline if i were you,1
had a wonderful experience on jal flying a in premium economy first having sakura lounge access was wonderful for my hour lay over next the flight attendant service was exceptional premiums economy seats are fantastic food and beverages are wonderful again the service is great i hope to fly jal again sooner than later,5
im a customer who is really upset i bought four return tickets jl from sydneytokyo departure on april through a travel agent called qunar due to the covid situation the flight was canceled and a refund application was made on over one year and a half i spend time communicating with qunar about the update of this refund every time i had the same answer that japan airlines hasnt refund yet and no information can be provided i totally understand there must be a large amount of application to deal with and i was really patient however it has been one year and a half and i really lose patient now im here to confirm with you whether you have refunded but the agent kept the money or the refund has not been dealt with if not i sincerely hope someone in this big company with a reputation fixes this problem i as a consumer have no other way to protect my own interest but hopefully your company can be responsible by the way there is no option in the travel date so just pick up one,1
while travelling back to the united states i had a flight from fukuoka to tokyo haneda with a connecting international flight with american airlines in tokyo narita my flight was delayed by minutes which left me almost no time to be able to catch the shuttle from haneda to narita when we landed i was paged to meet a representative on the jetway she informed me that jal knew i was in danger of missing my connecting flight due to their delay and escorted me directly to the baggage claim however when my baggage finally arrived we had missed the last shuttle to get to my flight in narita the representative then worked on an alternate method to get me to narita and minutes later they paid a taxi to drive me there a yen trip and i was able to catch my connecting flight instead of staying a night in tokyo they had also informed american airlines of my delay and i was expedited through the american airlines ticket counter to make it to my flight as it was boarding the lengths jal went to ensure i got to my next flight was above and beyond what i would have ever expected and i know for sure i will never receive this level of customer service ever again i wish i wasnt in such a hurry that i could properly show my deep gratitude to the staff,5
they charged me for extra baggage there were less than people in the flight still extra charges bags of kg each are allowed my bags were kg and kg is a lot i requested but no help not even cent discount,1
i originally booked my flights through mytrip please avoid this company but unfortunately my flight got cancelled due to covid and i experienced the worst customer service with mytrip when i thought everything was lost i decided to call jal the operating airline of tickets and they solved my problem on the same day from now on i will directly book with the airline company and avoid such agencies the customer service was also really friendly and patient,5
my girlfriend and me booked two flight tickets from melbourne to germany months before the supposed flight likemany other flights it got cancelled already months before the departure not mytrip or japanairlines sent us any message that the flight got cancelled we only find out by checkingit in the end we did the whole refund process paid extra and were calling them both to three times and japan airlines always said to us we have to talk tomytrip despite the fact that japan airlines were the ones who canceled the flight and mytripcom gave us kind of the same answer so both of the parties are not taking any responsibility and go against there own official guidelines they have written in their website mytrip said it take some timeto process the refund because of covid but we applied for our refund over months ago this is bullying and abusive behaviour and calculating that people get tired to ask for their money back but not with me if someone trying to go against them into court i am happy tojoin cheers willi,1
when my flight was cancelled due to covid flight restrictions i received a courtesy call from jal informing me of the cancellation and asking whether id like a full refund or credit the refund was in my bank account within days ive flown a lot with jal in the past and will stay loyal to them,5
i booked my flight literally months in advance the changed absolutely every flight on my itinerary right up to a month before im to depart they cancel the flight from london to glasgow if i want to get there days later it will cost me extra if i just want to get to london and find my own way to glasgow they still wanted to charge me extra so now im days before im to leave the country and my flight has now been cancelled i will now have to wait another weeks to get my money back from them and ive had to book my flight last minute with a totally different company do not book with japan airlines they cant be trusted to get you to your destination no matter how far in advance you book they are less than helpful over the phone making the whole experience a complete nightmare,1
i booked a flight for my husband and i for january it was part of a trip that involved the uk usa and cruising its now clear that this wont be possible due to covid so i cancelled our flights jal processed my refund promptly but charged a cancellation fee my understanding when i booked was that there would be no cancellation or change fees if the flights were cancelled due to covid restrictions i have tried unsuccessfully to get the rest of my refund via their customer service so i can see that i will need to take my complaint higher other airlines have provided a full refund so i really hope jal will do the right thing i had a put a travel date to submit this review but we have not yet travelled with jal and are not likely to do so unless they honour their free cancellation due to covid commitment,1
we recently had to book a flight to take our smallest family member to tokyo to have open heart surgery by the top canine cardiologist in the world the people who work at jal were so amazingly kind and understanding they called and checked up on us and invited us to bring sonny by to meet them at their santa monica location once they reopen after covid i felt enveloped in their caring it was on of the hardest times of my life and their kindness will live in my heart forever thank you so very much,5
jal stands out consistently in one aspect service at dallas airport ground staff actively asked for baggage tag to make sure my luggage will be checked through to tokyo onboard the crews were very hardworking even between meal service they walked around with drinks and snacks and collected garbage they kept toilets really clean they even turned off the personal tv of passengers who have slept to avoid disturbance to passengers because of the light they answered call buttons within seconds on arrival there were always plenty of staff to assist with luggage i have experienced over international airlines and none can reach jals service standard none of them is even close,5
despite touting free cancellation for covid related issues jal didnt honor this after booking a flight to bangkok for dec i discovered that there is a mandatory period of hotelbound quarantine even for fully vaccinated passengers on my arrival date so i tried canceling the ticket and their staff argued incessantly with me that things could change etc the whole point of my booking early was to set my plans including time away from work and meeting friends in thailand it seems pretty clear to me that this is covidrelated cancellation the last thing i expected from jal was a sleazy interpretation of what they clearly advertise as free cancellation,1

there were only four guests at the business class and four flight attendants each attendant came to say thank you to me and took care of me during the entire flight all of them smiled and they were very professional foods were amazing and wines were wonderful,5
i booked a ticket from del to dtw with henada airporttokyo in connecting flights after week they told they have change the connecting flights airport in tokyo to some other airport from henada to that airport it was km and also i would require a transit visa since i was living airport with these difficulties and having just hours for connecting flights i asked them to cancel and ask for full refund but they have took cancellation charge which is very frustrating,1
i was trying to fly to tokyo in june the airline cancelled my flight and said to get a refund go online so i did that and was charged a cancellation fee even though the flight was cancelled i called and talked to a very rude guy saying i should have called and that theyll have to call me back to see if im even eligible no where on the email did it say call and im not supposed to be charged if im asking for a refund on a cancelled flight i wont book with them ever again,1
i just flew in business class last week from sfo to bangkok there was no linenobody at check in it took a while to check all required documents for travel food and service were very nice the food came with plastic cover they still tried to offer business class experience as best as they can during covid bathroom was cleaned very often i wish the blanket was better it was little too short and not that soft my food did not come with their famous rolls but i asked and they brought couple for me in sealed plastic bag the flight from narita japan to bangkok offered very comfortable seats but i did not like the gift bag on this flight there were airport staffs walked you to the connecting flight as soon as you stepped out of the plane in japan overall it was a good experience traveling during covid,4
having flown business or combined firstbusiness on alphabetically american british airways air canada cathay pacific klm korean air malaysian airlines singapore thai airlines and united i can authoritatively state that japan airlines is the absolute worst in chronological order here are the problems i experienced on one or both legs of my transpacific journey from north america via tokyo to vietnam in the first class cabin the lieflat seats have huge privacy barriers so if you get stuck with an aisle seat theres no way you can see out of any of the windows as the flight attendants roll up all the visual barriers if youre inclined to feel uncomfortable in a windowless space beware i was given no choice of dinner menu items as the flight attendants let their preferred passengers a group of about suited businessmen traveling together as a group choose their menu selections first there were snack items but no palatable main entree items no slice of chicken or beef or a pasta dish nothing but grotesque looking unnameable seafoodlooking items that i presume are popular among nativeborn japanese the inflight entertainment system for movies etc is an absolute joke think windows or similar operating system with lots of dostype prompts seriously and truthfully the system used on these two aircraft dated back to the year the overall experience inside a jal aircraft is dreary dreary dreary its a good thing that other than wanting a nice filling hot meal i wanted to sleep and got lots of that oh and there was a box of chocolates set out for everyone in first class on a snack tray by the toilets and in that box of chocolates at least or in the box were actually chocolate as opposed to chocolatecovered mystery creme in the name of saving on costs apparently no corner was cut on a happier note the executive lounge inside narita airport is a nice place to wait for your connecting flight luckily though all six count em six showers were occupied when i arrived i was able to book a shower for minutes later enough time to have myself a shower and a shave before rushing out to board my next flight jal seems to thrive on its longstanding relationships with many very large japanese companies who send their salaried employees lucky enough to travel overseas in business or first class,1
i connected at narita airport for jl from narita to vancouver after passing through security for international transits i had about a hour layover before my flight and so made my way to the only japan airlines lounge that is open at narita the first class lounge on level of the main terminal building of terminal now open for both first class and business class passengers on the way i noticed that the airport was noticeably empty of travellers and even at the duty free shops that are usually full of chinese tourists lining up for purchases there were few customers normally the first class lounge entrance is on the rd floor and you take the elevator inside the entrance to go up to the th floor now you take the escalator outside the closed entrance to the first class lounge on the rd floor go up the escalator to the th floor and enter the first class lounge there from the th floor you can take the elevator inside the lounge to go back down to the rd floor where the shower rooms are located the dining area is on the th floor when i was there from around pm to around pm it was not very busy there were plenty of seats with plastic partitions between counter seats and open tables designated with signs for one person or a couple only there were plenty of staff to assist and as always service is superb attentive lowkeyed the coffee and soft drinks machines are still self serve but all of the food is now served to you by staff and not self serve this applies even to the special kitkat bars for coffee that used to be self serve in jars but are now neatly displayed one to a dish in a glass cabinet and must be served to you by staff behind the counter there were still quite a few items available made to order including sushi from the made to order sushi counter but i thought the food selection was noticeably smaller and more snack like rather than meal like the only meal like items were the trademark japan airlines beef curry which is traditionally available in both the sakura business class lounge and the first class lounge the japanese style breakfast curious offering for late afternoon and the ramen hot snacks to order included soup dumplings chinese xiao long bao and sichuan style mapo tofu the coffee served in the lounge is the same special coffee lines that jal sources from japanese coffee specialist mi cafeto for first and business class on its flights always very enjoyable and flavourful after grabbing a quick bite i then went to the seating area of the lounge the seating area has lots of individual sofa type seats and some counter type seats at the large windows which provide a good view of the adjacent gates and the runway beyond surprisingly the massage chairs in this section of the lounge are still available for use i did not have enough time to use them this trip as they typically have a cycle that runs about or minutes but i have used them in past visits to jal lounges and think they are quite good and enjoyable as far as massage chairs go i arrived at the gate for my flight before boarding time and counted people in the gate area indicating a relatively full flight during pandemic travel restricted times since jal uses a b with seats uncharacteristically for jal boarding was actually delayed for about minutes the announcement indicated airport issues boarding was by rows and as expected from the very orderly japanese people passengers only lined up when their rows were called there was preboarding for wheelchairs and families with young children requiring assistance following which was boarding for first classjal diamondoneworld emerald and then business class there is no first class cabin on jl and i was the only person in the jal diamondoneworld emerald line the flight is operated with a b aircraft with only business class and economy seating in business class the plane is equipped with the jal sky suite in a xx configuration there are seats in business class and about or passengers in business class on my flight the sky suite is a great seat with direct aisle access from every seat fully horizontal flatbed option and an enclosure around your seat that is a little above seated head level for a great deal of privacy i had a window seat at k and the seat beside me was empty as well the two rows of seats behind me so there was plenty of buffer between me and other passengers with direct aisle access the window seats on the flight are a great choice as in addition to greater privacy you can also take advantage of the extra large windows on a b dreamliner note that the sky suite window seats aisle seats and center section seats differ slightly from each other in terms of little storage areas and counters the window seats are particularly good as they have more ledges and counters around the seat to put things on and a storage tray behind the seat headrest for smaller items there is also a storage shelf under the video screen and room for a carry on bag under the shelf on boarding there was a large pillow toiletries bag slippers noise cancelling headphones light blanket and bottle water already placed at the seat surprisingly for cleaning obsessed pandemic times there was also an in flight magazine a duty free shopping magazine and an entertainment program magazine at the seat and actual printed menus were handed out before meal service pushback was similarly minutes delayed but with a short flight time of hrs minutes we were scheduled to arrive early and in fact did land very early at am over an hour earlier than scheduled shortly after take off cabin attendants came around to take drinks and meal orders japan airlines seem to have made minimal changes to in flight dining service the same number of meals in flight the same choices of food and number of courses are offered for a japanese style meal tray with bento box with sections for different appetizers followed by a tray with the main course with rice miso soup and pickles followed by a third tray with coffee and dessert the only difference is that all the containers now have covers that the passengers must remove themselves flight attendants wore masks at all times and wore gloves during meal service i opted for and preordered the japanese meal for dinner and as always it was beautifully presented and if anything even more delicious than on prior flights with jal this might be due to the fewer flights that jal is now operating and it apparently switching to serving what appears to be the same menu on all its flights for similar meals i checked on jals website the menu for jals flights on the same day for other us and european destinations and they appear to all feature the same menu items meal service was completed about ½ hours after take off cabin attendants then offered to put out the new airweave foam mattresses that jal now offers on some long haul overnight flights this was my first experience with the airweave foam mattress it is made of quite thick foam of maybe an inch and i thought it greatly enhanced the comfort of the seat when in flatbed position the sky suite seat has a fairly large video screen jal website indicates in but it is not a touch screen and while there is a separate hand held remote unit the interaction between the control and the screen is awkward they do not mirror each other in flight entertainment for english speakers has never been a strength of jal and so while there was an adequate selection of a few newer movies more older movies and then a handful of movies and tv programs with english subtitles many of the offerings were in japanese only or subtitled in japanese only about ½ hr before landing the second meal service was offered a japanese or western breakfast i tried the western breakfast described as a sweet potato spanish omelette but it in fact came with sausages too not outstanding like the japanese dinner first meal but still good prior to landing the head cabin attendant came by to thank me for flying with jal throughout the flight service was excellent and the cabin crew did an excellent job of keeping the toilets clean arriving at vancouver international airport there was the usual pass through the machines to complete your arrival declaration and then all passengers joined one line for the customs and immigration officers the line was quite long but moved quickly i had downloaded the arrivecan app and filled in and submitted my quarantine plan and health declaration prior to my flight and so passed through very quickly when it was my turn a bit confusingly the customs and immigration officer gave me one handout about quarantine and then as i passed those counters and walked towards the luggage carousels the area was cordoned off in a way that you had to pass an individual who i believe said he was with health canada who then gave you a different handout about the quarantine there was also information which you can access on website links through the arrivecan app but the information from the various sources differed for example the two handouts indicated i would receive calls from two type numbers and that i must answer those calls but then the links through the arrivecan app refers to a third and different number overall a very pleasant travel experience with jal during difficult times for travel no diminution of in flight service enhanced sleep product and excellent meals,5
we flew jal to helsinki but were not allowed entry because the layover was in tokyo jal assured us before we boarded in sydney that this would not be a problem and that they were responsible for only boarding us if we would be able to enter helsinki we were denied access at the border according to law in finland jal is responsible to fly return us since they boarded us the jal representative tried to trick us into signing a paper that would make us owe them almost k for the return flight thankfully the officer from finland stepped in the representative knowing he was found out said okay ill get the tickets no apologies,1
i had an excellent flight with japan airlines their service was amazing and the staff were very attentive the flights were quite empty due to current government and travel restrictions which meant that it was a very spacious and comfortable journey i hadnt flown with jal before but i will definitely consider flying with them again in the future,5
i had an excellent flight from london tokyo sydney the staff were all incredibly attentive and looked after us really well on both flights the flights were quite empty due to currently travel and government restrictions which meant that the journey was very comfortable i had not flown with jal before but will definitely fly with them again in the future,5
love comfy seats and legroom on economy foods are great they have the latest inflight movies and shows very accommodating attendants complete with toothbrush small soaps sanitary pads in flights,5
i called their costumer service in canada because i need to bring my guitar well as far as i know any airlines will allow you to handcarry your guitar however the jal website say yes but not for their customer service its so confusing and their turn off the phone because they cant answer it unprofessional customer service it is a simple common question,2
staff were fantastic even at airport they were friendly and courteous plane was clean and nothing was too much trouble,5
website allows you to buy ticket for another person but that person cannot board plane without your credit card cost me in cancellation fees cancelling only one hour after ticket purchase and they call to inform us of the issue,1
i had some trouble with getting the correct health certificate to go back home since i dont speak very much japanese the attendants went way above and beyond their duties and made phone calls to the hospital that issued my certificate walked me to a different clinic that could help me get a new certificate all so i could make it on my flight they were literally running around helping me so i could make it on board at the last minute truly the best customer service experience i have ever had thank you,5
check in was handled in a friendly efficient manor and at my leisure they even let me choose my seat and print out my boarding pass for my return flight the flight was quick and comfortable and my seat assignment was perfect for my needs when boarding i noticed the plane was painted as a large whale shark although it was a pink whale shark i mentioned to the flight attendant that i loved whale sharks and have snorkeled around them in the past i loved that we were traveling in a large pink whale shark in the middle of the flight she brought me a sticker they usually give to kids that depicted the plane a small thing but it shows they listen and care,5
travelling from south korea to sapporo with limited flight options available the best deal i could get for flights came with an apparent drawback the outward leg involved changing airports in tokyo from narita to haneda as a retired senior with plenty of time on my hands this didnt present as an insurmountable problem not having passed through narita for years and haneda being a first for me by contrast i actually looked forward to crossing tokyo the transfer turned out to be quite painless within mins of arrival at narita i had cleared immigration and customs and had proceeded downstairs to the jr station to catch the narita express for the min journey into central tokyo after changing trains onto the keikyu line at shinagwa the overall transfer to haneda airport from narita took about mins overall with about mins to spare before departure to sapporo surprisingly for an internal flight the haneda sapporo leg was operated by a widebodied airbus a with a seating configuration in economy and this january afternoon flight wasnt particularly busy i had selected a seat at the rear of the plane row in order to take photos of the snowcovered landscape coming into sapporo unobscured by aircraft wings and the rearmost cabin was virtually empty leaving the rain behind in tokyo the weather was perfect throughout the flight and coming into sapporo with the sun low in the sky close to setting at pm in the afternoon was picture perfect no drawbacks instead a most memorable internal flight,5
i had one of my worst flights experiences with jal when i flew from sydney to tokyo the service from staff was ok but the cleanliness and food is below expectations i was extremely ill after the flight that i was not able to get to my first hotel of choice in the city but rather an airport hotel as i kept having to run to the bathroom i did send an email to head office but the reply was dismissive and no apologies despite sending them pictures of hair on the pillow and stains on the tray and seats if you want to fly to japan only fly with ana airline the service the food and cleanliness has always been way ahead of jal just a shame the day i traveled flight was full,1
japan airlines jal is one the most greedy and dishonest airlines i have ever dealt with and i have dealt with a lot of airlines in my life they do any tactic and tricks to get away with their obligations we bought our tickets through a travel agency return tickets from canada to india at the beginning of covid crisis and at that time there was no talk of pandemic and lockdowns or even flight cancellations however during our trip countries locked down and flights cancelled and many people had to forget about their flights or ask for refunds we contacted jal and they said we cancelled your original return flight so we asked to reschedule our flights for later dates since jal changed our flights dates travel agency did not assume any responsibility afterward and we had to deal with jal directly after a few weeks we called to make sure our flights are set but jal said sorry this flight is cancelled too and either you have to reschedule or cancel your flights at that point we had to get back to our country canada and had no choice but to get the repatriate flights through government and cancel our jal ticket so we requested a refund and now they say since you bought your ticket through a travel agent we cant issue a refund to you and when contacted our travel agent they said as soon as jal changed your flight dates they took over and we have no control over your tickets we contacted jal again at first they agreed that they have control over our tickets however in a subsequent email they sent this dear valued customer thank you for submitting your refund form to japan airlines upon review we regret to inform you that your ticket does not qualify due to the reason below ticket is issued by a third party travel agency basically jal doesnt want to honor our tickets and refund us and look for any excuse not to do so this is the worst and most irresponsible airline i have ever dealt with if you value your money and sanity do not fly with japan airlines they easily ignore you and look for any excuse to rip you off,1
i have to say i couldnt fault jal airlines in any way flew in mid march just before the lockdown and because of this there was loads of room on planehad a whole row to myself all the staff from check in to stewardesses were friendly and helpful food was of japanese style and served with either chopsticks or proper metal cutlery would recommend for the attentive service you get,5
great little exras in premium economy including priority checkin lounge access dedicated boarding time more comfortable seats and sound cancelling headsets to name a few,5
this was my first international trip and i did not have any clue as to how the airlines and their staff would be travelling with a group on th january and on my birthday eve i initially enquired from the ground staff if i could carry a small cake inside the aircraft as i wanted to have something sweet as this time i could not a cake they agreed to it finally i dropped the idea as i knew it will be difficult to keep it inside while just about to board the aircraft i saw the crew dressed in ethnic wear as it was indias republic day this small gesture from their end will remain with me forever my inflight experience was equally good as the crew was very supportive and attentive to my requests i was booked in the economy class and the leg room was good enough to stretch my legs while returning from tokyo to new delhi on jl on st january i was given a middle seat to which i was not comfortable sitting while requesting to change the same for an aisle seat or a window seat they happily gave me premium economy seats so that one of the group members can also sit with me i was impressed with the presence of mind and the eye for detail which their staff had whenever i travel to japan it shall be through jal one suggestion if a passenger is travelling with you on his birthday anniversary the staff should make it a point to wish the passenger as this will earn you more customers in the future,5
we had the opportunity to fly jl in their international first class on a recent visit to asia we were the only in a cabin of people in spite of all the turmoil associated with covid the on board service was excellent their menu is more comprehensive than a michelin star restaurant the fas were ou going and always there when we needed something seats are good sized although not like some of the other first class carriers like ek a little dated in my opinion in flight entertainment options were limited for a hour to nrt but the overall experience was phenomenal i have flown them in business class before and their business cabins are also very comfortable and offer privacy and aisle access to every passenger,5
my family has been flying with jal since their on board service is always excellent the cabin crews are extremely professional and helpful the economy seat is so comfy especially for my hubby the food is fine for my taste as asian but not to my husbands liking end of march during the pandemic we as a family decided to fly back from indonesia to us since the choices of flights were narrowing down because of the traveling ban from several countries thankfully jal still had some flights to us with reasonable price even though we paid almost twice the price that we used to pay the flight from jakarta to tokyo still had decent amount of passengers meanwhile tokyo to boston only had like less than passengers but man their crews were still professional thank you so much jal for bringing us back to our home in the middle of this chaos,5
the flight attendants were friendly and the food was good on the return flight we were given a makeyourown dish which was an interesting concept and fun to put together the inflight entertainment was great there was a decent selection of recent movies to enjoy,4
it is much easier to put on a light jacket use a blanket or drink some hot tea to warm yourself up however when you are hot theres very little you can do to ease the discomfort the airline both times to and back has manage to keep the cabin well above degrees f at the minimum my traveling partner and myself sweat through the entire uncomfortable plane ride if you are sensitive to heat do not ride with jal you will be miserable ana and singapore airlines are your better bet as they have always kept the cabin comfortable,1
its a good thing to have a great customer service during normal times but jal has proven itself worthy even during crisis i bought jal flight through a third party that bailed out last min my flight was rescheduled a day earlier and my connection flight forced me to stay in japan airport for days and because of covid i couldnt get pass through the immigration and had to stay in the airport without any restaurant opened tried to call the agent and waited for hours for days straight with no avail i called jal and they promised to help me contact the agent with jals help i could get the agent to contact me they sent me an email saying that the flights i wanted was full and i need to get an upgrade to business class costing usdperson for shocking i then called jals customer service to check and though they mentioned that it is customary for them to only reschedule flight through the agent that we booked in they would like to help and made an exception they rescheduled me to a flight i needed their in flight crews were really attentivethey came over n translated to us every single time because all passengers are mostly japanese at this time nobody really travels to japan except their own citizensduring our final flight to seattle jl though there were only of us they were still excellent they made us origami with our names and said we could choose whichever seats extend our seats and relax jal youre the best,5
i was exhausted after a long international flight so although on one level i appreciated the exercise on another it was the last thing i wanted the walk from the bus that brought us from the international terminal to the departure date for the okayama flight took me almost as long as the flight itself a long long way admittedly there were no hassles of check in and security check since the bus dropped us arirside in comparison it was a relief to pas through the electronic gates and settle into my economy class seat relaxing too to know the rhythm and cadence f jal service no surprises nothing unexpected just the regular rhythm of good bythebook service arrival was fast small airport short wait for luggage bus waiting outside hasslefree,3
there was a lot going on end of feb and early march and alternation and changes were made a few times during this period staff at the north american hotline was patient and very helpful up the air during this critical time the crew looked after travelers well i would definitely fly with japan airlines again when everything is back to normal,5
i was in no particular hurry to get to haneda with lots of time before my connecting flights for once though the flight left on time and arrived slightly early relaxing then service was very good kind thoughtful gracious checkin clerks could not have been more thoughtful seeing that i had a long journey ahead of me no food of course but an entirely predictable and thus somehow comforting selection of drinks delivered with a smile plane was only two thirs full which always helpw people relax al in all then a good flight,4
excellent service as usual lovely air and ground crew our flight was on time definitely recommend,5
wow what a brilliant flight japan airlines together with malaysian airlines are the two greatest airlines i have flown with and i have been lucky enough to have travelled many times around the globe the staff were truly outstanding polite helpful and provided an exceptional service the plane was very clean seat space generous and food brilliant with so much choice the infotainment screen was comprehensive and kept me entertained for hours the food was a real highlight whereby they provide information on the chefs who created all the individual dishes which is a beautiful touch the food was generous original and very tasty the drinks that were offered were both non and alcoholic in nature which was great they also offered snacks throughout the whole flight which in over flights i have never experienced however for me it was the incredibly profitable customer service that i experienced is the true beauty of flight well done japan airlines my greatest flight experience ever please accept my respect,5
we loved our experiences on jal also like ana a lot but decided to give jal a go this time as they advertised their awards for economy class seats in addition to having a split on their not often do you get a seat configuration in cattle class anymore everyone we dealt with was fantastic the seat lived up to our expectations and was miles more comfortable than ac the cabin was kept spotlessly clean the service was very quick and attentive the meals we thought were excellent washrooms always clean and available snacks and drinks replenished frequently though we waited on hold for hours to connect with an agent to rebook our seats back to canada the agent was exceedingly helpful and did everything we asked of her and was super friendly about it we often travel to japan usually with ana to acquire star alliance points now will choose jal over ana if available and not overly expensive as the seats were comfortable and there was a lot of space around our seat thanks,5
unfortunately for us jal really disappointed us big time as opposed to a few years ago when they gave us excellent service under the current situation japan airlines did not honour a reservation made by our carrier delta airlines to begin our journey back from singapore back to montreal canada the delta representative did a remarkable job securing a reservation for us and jal simply did not care and bumped us from our flight out of singapore shame on you japan airlines you guys did not have the decency to honour a commitment to us your customers in that flight and by the way your app sucks big time as well because it is only in japanese and you are supposed to be an international carrier jal as an airline has quite a bit to learn about customer care try getting a few pointers from delta airlines who have been outstanding helping us to get back home please share this review as much as you can so that japan airlines treat customers with more empathy and respect they are a disgrace to japanese culture this time,1
japan airlines has been very considerate of its passengers requiring flight cancelations during this difficult times of coronavirus excellent service japan airlines,5
jal is a quality airline one of the best things about jal is the configuration in the economy cabin of their also great seat pitch service was excellent the ife was lacking a bit but still enough to watch,5
the food was tasty and the show was amazing and i loved the snack and dessert were astounding and loved the flight attendant,5
the flight was good the plane i was on was a bit outdated service was good it was hard to hear the staff because they all wore masks,4
it is absolutely impossible to get a hold of a person to make a change in my reservation i have been calling japan numbers toll number very expensive and us numbers to no avail they obviously do not care for some reason the change cannot be done online but they wont answer the phone or the emails the most pathetic thing ive seen in my life,2
i always choose the aircraft i fly in because i want to choose the seating type i usually choose aircraft with twin seats when i fly with my wife and kids so we can sit two by two i dont like triple seats because that means i will be the odd one out sitting next to a stranger while my wife sit together with our kids on this trip from singapore to vancouver i was travelling with my son so it was only two of us airlines use b b or a on longhaul flights which are normally configured in or seating in economy class since i dont like sitting in triple seats when there are only two of us i chose jal because it is the only airline that configures its b and b with twin seats on the singaporetokyo sector jal uses b configured in seating with increased seat pitch in their sky wider cabin and on the tokyovancouver sector jal uses b with eight abreast seating this means on both sectors my son and i could sit in twin seats by ourselves the seating was the most important factor to me next was the service jal always offers excellent service even the food is special they have special japanese meals such as eel rice and mos burgers prepared by their flight kitchens in tokyo i chose jal even though the fare was a few hundred dollars more than other airlines to me comfort is more important than the cost i will definitely choose jal again,5
the flight ticket was relatively cheap the food was great and the service was good there was a lounge in narita where we have a buffet meal before we boarded the plane it was free you just present your boarding pass to avail it,5
very nice and relaxing flight the crew were functional and the food was acceptable getting to the destination was problem less,4
flight attendants were polite helpful and efficient seats seemed to have generous legroom selection of movies was fine and food was good too my only criticism is that the cabin was hot and they did not bring drinks around often like other airlines,4
i was real impressed with the comfort and service that i received from the folks at japan airlines even in economy class the flight was long but they made it nice with multiple meals free drinks free movies free headphones hot towels to freshen up and everything except a bed if you need a bed you have to move to first class but we did not find it necessary the staff was first class and made the hour flight very comfortable if i ever have to fly to this part of the world again i will be sure to book with japan airlines,5
after much research i decided to pay the little extra and fly jal as my son flies them all the time to japan and highly recommended them wow was he right i will only fly jal if my destination is where they fly the north american airlines could learn a lot from them with respect to customer service from booking to check in to flight experience they are beyond exceptional they have extra leg room in economy they offer incredible food constantly throughout flight with real silverware imagine that they provide alcoholic beverages in their pricing as well the plane is immaculate and the bathrooms are well maintained throughout the long flight and are larger than a shoebox the flight attendants are overly polite and helpful and dont yell into the intercom just so they can hear themselves talk they only come on for announcements and with very gentle voices they dont flip the lights on in the middle of the night they slowly bring them on the pilots did not even speak on our first flight so the plane was very quiet and we had some restful sleep en route the airline is extremely on time they depart as scheduled and on our return flight we departed and ended up on tarmac about mins due to lightning and pilot came on and apologized and said we promise to do what we can once in air to keep you on time and they did we arrived mins earlier than scheduled they provide pillows blankets excellent movie entertainment and headsets this is how an airline should be,5
i too like chontls review am very impressed with japan airlines excellent customer service in fully refunding airfares due to corona virus last year when singapore airlines cancelled my flight and i needed to seek a refund as alternative fares were not suitable to us it took them over weeks to refund nearly i was expecting a similar situation at the very least but got all my money back this time within a few days with out so much as a phone call needed it was all handled proficiently through their website i will definitely be rebooking with japan airlines in the future,5
at the early part of the covid breakout we needed to reroute our trip from hk to another transfer point due to vn tightening their travel requirements we changed from a cathay pacific flight to jal through tokyo the quick connection at narita in tokyo was super quick very efficient the airlines cabin crew were all very good at their jobs and the food was decentgood didnt get much sleep but the cabin stayed dark enough that many did,4
i have booked the flights from bangkok to haneda for myself and my niece during march however due to the covid situation i have regrettably had to cancel the bookings and the airline is kind to not charge the cancellation fees due to tickets class conditions i have called the airline to cancel my bookings and request for full refund on feb and the call center named khun nichaporn and i got my full refund through my debit card on feb i am truly appreciated the efficient and the fairness of japan airline for this case and i will always fly japan airline with my japans trip you are such professional and generous airline thank you so much for making this process so efficient best regards chonticha d,5
great people on this flight and the one back they were so lovely i told our lovely attendant that i really liked the wine we had with dinner she promptly popped back with another bottle for me the little ones the plane was comfortable the food was delicious i could recommend jal more highly,5
excellent service throughout very comfortable reclining seats a really good selection of food and drinks,5
one of our best flights ever two seats by the window and plenty of space for our feet made it very comfortable to go from tokyo to helsinki good and tasty food and drinks and very friendly and serviceminded crew we slept very well in our seats with pillow and blanket available we can highly recommend japan airlines,5
good service nice food and enough space to squeeze out just from the middle window seats without having to disturb the aisle seat only slight issue was the seats seemed firmer than other airlines and were a bit hard,5
i have been travelling to japan regularly twice yearly i love the good food lovely scenery and great hotels since five years ago i have been using jal and no other airlines the cabin crew are friendly and the food is enjoyable what i wish to emphasise is that they are very customer friendly in view of the recent covid outbreak i cancelled my trip to tokyo for arts auction jal allowed me to cancel all my international and domestic flights and gave me full refund within two weeks i have different experience with my travel agent when i wish to cancel another trip to europe for the same reason from now on i would definitely consider jal as my first choice,5
whenever we can we prefer to fly jal their service and level of comfort is second to none last trip especially the cabin was not cold so we were perfectly comfortable without adding a wrap or blanket and the food is wonderful,4
jal used to be a snob airline while they even used to see video how to be a jals cabin attendant in their flight so i used to avoid jal because of their unfriendly service firstly the seats are so comfortable and wide it made me relaxed during my whole of trip served food is also improved comparing to salty previous foods minor but some improvements are necessary on jal are for example cabin attendants never helps passengers to lift up baggage which is normally done by ana english announcement is very poor,5
i travel back and forth to japan or times a year and i always enjoy flying with jal i have flown other airlines air canada cathay korean and i have to say for comfort quality of food even in economy and service jal is the best although korean comes a very close second,5
pleasant flight the service is superb the stewards are very accommodating and also pleasant they made sure that we are comfortable,5
opted for bulk head seats the st row with more leg spaceit had a lot of leg room couldnt reach the bulkhead even with legs fully extended more than any other airlines in economy,5
many reviews rave about this airlines superb organization customer service and amenities when it comes to food japan airlines also exceeds all expectations when it comes to their food face it an airlines food can make or break the flight jal not only gives free drinks with the meals but the main meal showcases the signature dish of up and coming chefs the food is served in dishes not cardboard to be eaten with real metal knife fork and spoon you will find no plastic sporks here while i am not a fan of their red house wine i did enjoy their sake and japanese beers special meal needs are welcome just let them know food preferences when you book in respect to their planes seating service and cleanliness the rest of the flight experience was head and shoulders above the nofrills service which we have been made to tolerate with north american carriers,5
second time with jal one world partnership with qantas on their dreamliner so comfortable along with fantastic polite service being a loyal qantas frequent flyer for numerous years and travelling in premier economy our luggage is tagged with priority access to qantas business lounge not offered by qantas upon return flight we get same again access to the fabulous jal business lounge the pluses are numerous flying with jal especially when we get to baggage claim and our luggage is waiting for us last year i did send a letter email to qantas querying why they dont offer same to a loyal customer never received a reply so definitely jal preference for me on my travels from now on,5
my seat was very comfortable the service was excellent the staff was friendly and accommodating everything was very good the only reason i am not giving it five stars is because the food was horrible i had the western menu but there were items and tastes not recognizable to me the only food that was warm were the main entrees mini quiches should not be served cold ruben sandwiches should have melted cheese and be warm everything looked beautiful but when items that should be warm are served like they were just taken out of the refrigerator they are tasteless or horrible the bad food was not just on one flight it was on all separate legs of my round trip if you take them order a special meal or bring your own food,4
from the time i flew jal years ago i have been a strong supporter of the airlines my memories from those flights were great the seats were comfortable the service impeccable and the food so memorable it made flying long distances more bearable and i have recommended the airlines at every opportunity i didnt get the chance to fly it again until recently and was dismayed to find that the standard had fallen i booked four flights hawaii to japan to singapore and on the way back singapore to japan to hawaii regretted it after the first flight the seats were small and uncomfortable the service was still excellent but they dont offer you a choice of meals anymore we were only provided one option hopefully you like the meal of the day,4
the staff on board during my journey were so helpful they couldnt do any more to help on boarding the plane the staff came to my seat to introduce themselves explain the fooddrinks service and to offer champagne or orange juice throughout the flight the staff were offering drinks and food service was as and when you ordered you are given an extra mattress to put on to the bed when it is in full recline which was super comfortable in board entertainment was plentiful and varied would definitely fly with jal again,5
our first experience flying jal when checking in the entire staff came out from behind counter and bowed to us very comfortable seats and fabulous food had our choice of either asian or western cuisine so impressed,5
perhaps it is downhill after you fly singapore airlines i had such high expectations for this airline and they were not met across the line the entertainment system was hard to navigate the food was not as good as i had expected and neither was the service i did not care for the seats either,4
i am not joking i really consider jal as the best air company for its courtesy to passengers jal provides excellent service on every step so your journey to japan starts on board i highly recommend this air company and it is sincerely,5
the service was awesome the staff are always very excited to help you the food was not as bad as i spected and the flight was super nice if ill be able to have a flight back to japan i will take it again with japan airlines,5
all of the flight attendants were so well mannered and pleasant actually not only them most of the japanese travellers are so kind as well when i came to my seat the guy in the seat next row to me waited for me to take out whatever i wanted from my hand luggage and then said let me help you madam and he carried my bag to be placed in the luggage space above us i didnt need to ask for help then while meals were being served later i was so tired and wanted to sleep so one of the flight attendants told me to just sleep when i woke up one of the ladies came up to me and asked if i would like to have my meal now i replied yes please and she brought the meal to me specially i have never experienced such care in any of my travel before,5
i cant recommend jal enough from the check in all the way though to deplaning the staff and crew were fabulous comfortable business seats delicious food and no request was too much i had trouble opening the overhead bin during flight and asked the attendant when she had a moment to please help me out she dropped what she was doing and immediately ran to help saying im sorry it took me so long it literally was a nanosecond what a pleasant change from the usual surly north american airline crews well definitely fly them again ifwhen the opportunity arises,5
a very pleasant flight the crew very professional and attentive didnt regret flying with japan airlines,4
jal gives you the best value you could expect from an economy flight great food attending staff frequent snacks and comfortable seats,5
very nice good service very comfortable seating station worth it if you can afford it for the hour trip as a bonus all passengers were allow into the japan airlines loach in those in economy,4
during the booking process i was not able to book premium economy on the way to the us but was able to for the return from boston the site lead me to believe i could do seat selection a determining factor for me in using an airline turns out that is not actually possible on the economy bookings so this was incredibly frustrating follow up customer service was terrible and overall experience was very unsatisfactory definitely going back to cathay once the world returns to normality again,1
flew from londonhaneda on b both ways probably the best airline ive ever flown from about international airlines everything is tailored to the customer really good flight and better than their other japanese competitor by far definitely recommended if its a good price,5
this was the best economy long distance flight i ever experienced the new dreamliner that jal uses had excellent leg room and pitch in economy configuration i ordered a special meal hindu probably thinking it would be vegetarian it wasnt but it was absolutely delicious and the fa explained all the ingredients to me the staff are very kind and attentive it was great value booked via ba and i was able to check in a snowboard for free,5
i travelled to tokyo on this airline i find the seats comfortable with enough legroom the food served was also good the in flight entertainment can be better but i am ok with what was provided,4
we traveled from miami to manila with a connecting flight in new york we were cutting it close with time with our connecting flight when japan airlines called me to make sure i was on my way a staff member met us at t he counter promptly checked us in and personally escorted us through the linessecurity all the way to boarding the airplane to make sure we made our flight the flight itself was great they provide warm hand towels prior to serving meals beer and wine are included options with meals they provide a variety of entertainment options from video games to movies books and music the staff was great i highly recommend flying with japan airlines,5
we booked business class flights to tokyo due to government travel advisories on the corona virus outbreak in japan we cancelled our flights japan airlines insisted on charging us in cancellation fees when all other airlines like ana announced special handling arrangements to provide a full refund we were going to rebook with jal but they refused to consider waiving their cancellation fee this is unfair and unsympathetic to passengers very disappointed and will not rebook with you,1
we checked in on line the night before our flight when we got to the airport hours before our flight a long line had already formed before the counter opened when counters opened there was no sign as to the location of bag drop for on line check in had my husband not sought help from an employee we would not have been directed to the shorter line when we finally got in the plane i was sanitizing the trays and seat belt when the stewardess kind of scolded me to buckle up food was better this time than my initial trip from lax to manila it was decent that they fed us more on this airline than any of the other ones ive flown overall i was satisfied with my experience but a little dissapointed to have experienced these minor issues that i did not experience with jal in the past,4
note we did not actually fly with jal on this trip here i am describing their customer service when i called to cancel our trip my family was supposed to fly to japan next week but we decided to cancel as there is currently a travel advisory for japan from singapore due to covid when we called jal they were very understanding and waived the cancellation fee we didnt really expect them to do so because weve heard that passengers on other airlines have been having issues getting refunds on their flights to south korea and south korea currently has many more cases of covid than japan we flew with jal before and liked the trip very much this time round we were extremely impressed with their customer service standards and would choose them for our next trip to japan,5
the cabin is clean and i can speak in japanese so its easy enjoy conversations with cabin attendants in japanese best china international airlines im not going to ride eastern airlines,4
great airling good service the food was a good variety found enough to eat they have earphones available and it was restful,5
organisationefficiency service jal excelled in every aspect of our journey to tokyo looking forward to our next visit,5
i flew in coach class from bangkok to narita the flight attendants were friendly very efficient and professional the food was quite tasty and filling and the entertainment system was pretty good with a large selection of new movies in english i would recommend flying jl to my friends and family,4
i flew from dfw via aa and connected in nrt to japan airlines to fly via a b in coach class from narita to bangkok the flight attendants were all young and very friendly and professional the food was quite good we had a choice of chicken and rice or pork and rice to speed things along they presented a picture card of the main course chickenpork in a few languages so you simply pointed to what you wanted for desert they served little cups of haagendazs ice cream because it was a hour flight prior to landing we had a fluffy breakfast bun and choice of beverage i would fly jl again and would recommend them to friends and family,4
after booking our trip almost a year ahead as we got closer to our trip we called jal to get seat assignment it was almost impossible talking to a live person and once you did get someone on the phone i felt like we got the runaround our flight was on american airlines operated by japan airlines we first called american airlines and got to talk to someone immediately they informed us that any changes had to be made thru jal we called jal and after waiting for about min they told us to call aa but wait theres more after days in japan with of us traveling jal counter could only check in of us what whywe ask they have this unapologetic smirk on their face and say we should call american airlines are you kidding me we call and aa airliens says they have nothing to do we ticketing jal counter then tells us theres nothing they can do and we should call our travel agent its probably am back homewe cant call our agent jal counter attendants just stand there and dont try to help at all while we franticly look for local travel agent info we are in japan mind youand cant even call the local agency office i go back to one of the many jal staff standing around and beg her to at least help us call an agency contact on japan after minutes of dumbfounded contemplation she gestures to an agent standing at the counterthank god because we feel that woman bent over backwards to help usand she did she got on the phone and called the number i had for the local agency and after minutes on the phone told us everything was ok back to the othersthere was one agent that helped us initiallyshe was rude condescending and everything but helpful if it werent for the last two ladies who helped us and the only interaction i got was from this first counterperson i would never fly japan airlines again how could an airlines ever employ such standoffish unhelpful personnel,2
first time i fly with jal and business class the simple and elegant of japan is show at the service and plane interior compare with others its come with simple and calm color and ambience for business class passengers fly from narita airport is encourage to use the sakura lounge located in nd floor which provide lunch but there is not much variant menu in others hand they served good food chinese siomay italian chicken wrap with caesars dressing japanese soba japanese rice with beef stew attractive automatic beer machine wine sake bar coffee and excellent tea corners kids menu include juice and desserts is available sakura lounge is separated two stores nd floor is for dining and st floor is lounge also bathroom in st floor will you take a shower before flying hours long haul but lounge is not access to boarding gate so please enjoy yourself but dont forget the boarding time i fly with jl for business class they offer the jal comfortable pajamas like cardigan with elegant soft green a pouch of eye mask moisture mask ears plug tooth brush about the inflight meals its call bedd cuisine by jun kurogi i choose japanese meals its course meals start from appetizer menu is yuba crabmeat with wasabi flavored soy starchy sauce tuna sashimi poached potherb mustard garland chrysanthemum mushroom in japanese broth with salmon roe simmered chicken vegetables bechamel sauce caviar grilled shrimp with aromatic vegetable sauce japanese omelet vinegared turnip wrapped with salmon there is lots for appetizer right serve in a overcute bento box the chopstick stand is red japanese crane origami but its plastic you may bring it but ask the permission with the crew for main course its dainomono marinated chicken with tar tar sauce and yellow tail teriyaki and they mention kcal and served with japanese famous steamed rice miso soup and japanese pickles and of course even i am full but its always have a room for desserts black sesame pudding served as dessert and hot tea all time served if you still hungry instant noodles peanuts chocolate in the pantry one hour before landed the crew served ice cream or chinese dumpling i choose haagen dazs ice cream inflight entertainment is not updated but so far not lousy at all funny thai movie box office movie is available the business class chair is reclining flat and comfy blanket is available the toilet amenities is awesome the toner and lotion is shiseido which is japanese famous branded lotion but the toilet size is same with others toilets overall fly with jal is experience great service and thank you for the ground crew and cabin crew,5
shouldve checked the aircraft type before booking business class its not worth it service is excellent but thats always true for most business cabin service for this route with this airline just go with economy unless they upgrade the business cabin,4
complaining about business class is pretty snobby isnt it but reviews require honesty so i have to say that yes it was better than economy or premium economy but not the standard i expect from business class service quite good and certainly friendly although they forgot one of our main meals served entrees and then totally forgot the main dish out of the wine selections on the menu they didnt have half available i ended up getting my third choice movies have very limited selection in english and you cant remove subtitles no pyjamas for overnight flight you get a top but no bottoms seats do go flat but are not as big or as comfortable as some other premium airlines it wasnt a disaster but for business class they can to do better they lounge is awesome though classy and great food and drinks,4
was one of the best economy seat i ever experienced good service delicious food great in flight movies and comfortable seat thanks jal,5
jal called it j class which is premium economy seats for their domestic flights leather seats with leg rest wider arm rest and of course room space they only served drinks for domestic sectors,4
got a promo price and decided to try service was good and food was much better seats were typical reverse herringbone your legs will go underneath the tv console managed to sleep well since you get a degc flat bed,5
the key is when you recline your seat you dont have to worry about the passenger behind you are given x kg baggage and access to airport lounge food was ok but you get sake and mini champagne service was excellent,5
with the global covid widespread many countries badly affected with high numbers of infected cases are allowing cancellation both for airlines and hotels japan is one of the highest in infected cases outside china yet main a regid stand on cancellation i am truly disappointed and disgusted by the way the situation is handled compromised on concerns by travellers and their safety has never been a priority i will never recommend jal and highly discourage anyone i know from choosing this airline,1
i booked a flight via the website a few months ago and there is the corona virus outbreak thinking that the situation in asia might get worse i went on the website to cancel the tickets to realize that they will charge me yes each flight that cancellation fee is insanely high my coworker cancelled her roundtrip tickets for and it only costs her eva airlines changing the tickets will cost each way difference in fare this is the last time im going to fly with jal im more than willing to pay more for a lower cancellation fee now i know,1
first time taking jal to sapporro the flight was comfortable ample leg space and comfortable seats crew were friendly highly recommend this airline,5
i loved flying japan ailines but this flight was just very hot the trip was hours long and the cabin was at least degrees if not warmer this severely impacted the comfort of the passengers the service was still excellent but the climate was uncomfortable,3
the flight from san francisco to tokyo was great this plane had more legroom and wider seats than ive seen on domestic economy flights they also served two meals and free beverages which was nice too the inflight entertainment options were ok although i appreciated that i didnt need to use my own device service was excellent with friendly helpful staff,5
i cant say enough about japan air my daughter and i flew to japan in november this was her first time flying japan air made the trip a memorable one for her and for me as well they are so attentive to detail and take the time to make sure each passenger is well looked after which is a rarity in todays airline industry where most airlines treat passengers like cattle japan air treats you like a vip even in coach the airplane was clean the food was well prepared it well presented and very tasty the leg room was more than enough and we were able to stretch out our legs without restriction we will fly japan air whenever we can they are hands down one of the best airlines,5
we have flown many times now with jal and it is superb the crew are always fabulous and the plane is clean with excellent service and good food their japanese timing is as always incredible we will be booking our next trip in the not to distant future keep up the good work,5
we flew from tokyo to boston on a hour flight the convenience of nonstop was the most important factor in flight selection we like the configuration of seats which was seats were reasonably spaced for coach service was pleasant the dinner was quite good and bathrooms were kept clean the second meal which was billed as a taste of ny from dean and deluca was poor individual screens played a variety of movies but many of the same features were being shown both in early january and early february,4
first time flying jal and it wont be our last as regular travelers economy class i must admit that jal economy class is a level above the rest of the airlines we have flown over the last years the extra leg room and wider seats make for a very pleasant flight with an attentive crew and very good food just sit back and enjoy the flight,5
first time flying jal and it wont be our last as regular travelers economy class i must say that the jal is one of the best so far more leg room and seats slightly wider than normal good food and attentive crew made for a most relaxing flight,4
got in on a seat sale so took advantage as offers skywards points for emirates never again polite service but nonexistent online checkin thought for a while my flight had been cancelled poor communication received zero emails past my payment confirmation food onboard was inedible service was ok overall besides the decent baggage allowance cannot say anything great about this airline and would not fly again,1
superb level of service and comfort having travelled practically all worlds most recognized airlines jal by far exceeded my best expectations generous space in economy class canine fabulous selection of food and beverages including menu created by rising japanese chefs sake gin french wine etc and highly professional and attentive to the very detail crew bravo,5
my husband and i were flying through japan airlines on january thth when the taal volcano erupted and all airports in the philippines were shut down jal flew to the philippines and the captain flew back to japan after learning that naia was closed when we returned to japan we had to go through immigration collect our luggages and had to check in to a hotel the first night was covered however we had to pay the extra night that we had to stay i understand that this was mother nature and there is nothing we can do the experience would not have been that horrible if jal actually kept us updated about our flight when we went to our hotel jal provided us with a sheet of paper with instructions on how to call for any updates mind you there were approximately other passengers on the same flight as us at this hotel when we called the numbers that were provided to us it was all in japanese we had to ask the employees at the hotel to translate for us we waited for about an hour to finally speak with someone when i spoke with the representative at jal she said to check the website for any updates the website they provided us was in japanese at this point i was so frustrated we literally felt stranded in japan not knowing if we would fly today tomorrow next week or at all it is so difficult to communicate with almost everyone that we spoke with at jal and no one was able to give any answers to when we would be able to fly to our destination the website nor the phone number that was provided were of no assistance expedia finally assisted with setting us up with philippine airlines it is disheartening to fly with an airline company and you feel so helpless because of the lack of communication and unsure of when you are actually going to reach your destination we have been flying for almost hours when this occurred when we were going to narita to catch the flight with philippine airlines we had to walk to the shuttle bus area that was minutes away at am the hotel was an hour away from narita airport i normally do not write bad reviews when i fly as i know things do occur but i am writing this review to urge better communication with passengers so we dont feel like we are in the dark this was the worst travel experience i have ever had i will never fly through japan airlines again,1
flew it liked it will do it again great service no impeccable service they didnt miss a trick highly recommend the flight and crew,5
i recently flew with jal as part of a code share booking id made with british airways theyre hard product is superb ive flown on s with other airlines in the past and theyve always felt very cramped however unlike other airlines jal only has eight seats across rather than nine so the seats were much more spacious width wise there was also plenty of legroom in front the crew were very polite and proved good service the food was very good for economy too the infight entertainment system was large and very responsive my only slight criticism is there wasnt as much filmtv choice as on other airlines and the free headphones were terrible for my return flight i bought a cheap pair of ear bud earphones instead highly recommended instead certainly if i ever fly to japan again ill be looking at jal as a preference,5
ive traveled with this flight jl few times a departure time is earl morningamwhich a public transport is not available airport shops are closed only a couple of shop are available arriving in uk london heathrow is early morning which is a business morning rush hour itll take a long hour to reach central london by car public transport an aircraft is ok even an economy class but always a long queue for a toilet users,3
i had to cancel my flight from singapore to new chitose airport recently due to my sudden injured ankle i called the customer service to do so and the lady also suggested that i get a medical certification mc to waive the cancellation fee after i had emailed them the mc they called me almost immediately and explained clearly the details of the full refund the last time that i flew with them was more than years ago which was a very pleasant experience such superb service and i couldnt wait to fly with jal again thumbs up,5
traveled on jl on hard to fault jal the economy seat product called jal sky wider is one of the best out there in terms of width and pitch food was great with various little extra dishes to accompany the main meal second meal service also good excellent service from the immaculately presented cabin crew polite and efficient perhaps some extra western content on the ife system would have been good but overall a very good flight with jal,5
my flight was melbourne to tokyo return large seat and leg room great staff great food i had vegan option two kg checked bags no charge for snowboard bag seriously hard to fault could have some more in flight entertainment options,5
i am taking the morning flight on jal to haneda airport in tokyo from bangkok i expected an excellent lounge with food for all tastes instead i am experiencing very unelegant lounge with mainly japanese dishes probably replicating the lowest eatery in tokyo for a westerner there is nothing but some soggy banana muffins and danish of the worst quality and not one choice of breads the lounge reeks of highly strong smells coming from the japanese dishes which are not fit and appropriate for an early morning departure i have been in other jal lounges and this one has taken me by surprise where are the airlines headed do they not care about their customers,1
this was my first time flying this airline partners with american airlines although the plane was definitely a bit dated and seats were not as modern as others the service and food options was very good i would not hesitate to book again or to recommend,4
i was excited to see that my flight from chicago to tokyo that we booked through american airlines was being serviced by japan airlines since i had heard good things about them the flight attendants were so attentive and pleasant and the food was very good it was a comfortable flight and it was on time maybe even a little early the entertainment options were very good also very very good experience,5
worst flying experience of my life thirty hours of delays entirely the airlines fault no information not permitted to leave gate not hotel provided everyone had to sleep on the floor lying cheating supervisors refused to inform how to make a complaint or claim tried to pressure into signing some japanese waiver for a tiny gift card airline currently paying a usd fine for similar issues in chicago,1
overall the flight was good i was traveling with my wife and yo daughter and it was very comfortable and relaxing the flight crew were great as well very friendly and were able to make adjustments to meals and such so my wife and i can take turns taking core of our daughter only downside is the miles program makes it extremely difficult to redeem miles for flights firstly you can only redeem for flights that start or end in japan you cannot use japan as a connection to some other destination if you do want to travel somewhere else via jal you effectively need to book two flights that endstart in japan and go through the entire customs checkin security process in japan as jal will not combine them as a proper connecting flight also the points required for a flight or upgrade can vary drastically the difference of a single day can result in needing x as many points,4
i absolutely loved this flight it was mine and my parents first time flying this airline and we would definitely fly with them again the seats in economy were spacious my dad who is over feet tall had the first relaxing flight of his life in economy the food was great vegetarian and glutenfree meal great customer service nice entertainment options but the seats were the best,5
this is the first time im using jal i often go abroad using so many airlinesbut this time i have to give stars to jalthe flight attendant is very friendly amd helpful im so impressed on details they do that time my son accidentaly touch his glass so the water goes all over him one of the flight atenndant came fast to him tought she will clean the mess with unfriendly face like other airlines atenndant but wrong she came to my son and asking are you ok are you ok helo clean him and bring him new glass of drink then after she clean the mass and in the airport i saw jal crew bring a paper with someone names as this passanger almost late and when they find him this passanger couldnt walk fast as age and they sudden run took wheelchair to bring him fasy to the plane im realy impressedtry and you will thinj same as me,5
i recently booked a flight from paris to sydney premium economy with japan airlines i flew finnair paris to helsinki and then should have been on a japan airlines flight from helsinki to tokyo my flight from paris was delayed so i missed my connecting flight when i arrived in helsinki i was told i was being put on a finnair flight however finnair dont have premium economy when i queried this they told me there was nothing they could do and i would have to take it up with customer service when i got home so i took the flight and then i contacted japan airlines when i got home they have now told me there is nothing they can do i have to contact finnair i am slightly confused by this as i booked and paid my flight through japan airlines in my compliant i was also requesting a refund for the flight i booked so why would an airline that i didnt pay give a me a refund i have gone back to japan airlines times and been given the same response each time they also havent addressed some of the issues i raised in my letter it is such a shame because i had such a good experience with my flights from sydney to paris however after this knowing the way they act when something goes wrong i will never fly with them again they actually have a really good product but their responses to my complaint letters have been diabolical looking at some of the other reviews i have read on other websites this seems to be a fundamental issue for them if you are thinking of flying with japan airlines think again because if something goes wrong they dont want to know,1
i was in the cattle car so it was cramped but thats not that big of a deal since the flights only for an hour and i dont have problems with leg room since im short the flight attendants were always ready to lend a helping hand with a smile エコノミークラスだったので座席は狭かったのですが時間程度のフライトでしたので大した問題はないと思います客室乗務員の方は笑顔でお客さんに対応してます短いフライトでもドリンクサービスありました,4
id read that the jal travel experience had reviewed so well and i was not disappointed the care and consideration from the flight attendants was exquisite i found the food and presentation impressive such pride was taken to introduce their chefs and a range of food options oh and the seats had so much arm and leg room such a treat to travel with jal,5
dsiclaimer if you plan to use them for international flights then disregard this review this review only applies for domestic flight this airline is good for international flights but if you are using them for domestic flight as a foreigner you will be shut out of all their online service you cannot book any domestic flights online unless you pretend to live in japan and you can only manage your booking as long as you pretend to live in japan if you sign up for their jmb program you will not be able to see your domestic flights because you do not live in japan and this is only available for people living in japan to get their app to display english text you need to know japanese to find the option to switch to english then of course you cannot log on to your jmb profile because again you have to be japanese so then you also cannot automatically find your flights and the get your ticket on the app and you cannot sign up for jmb pretending to be japanese so there you go shut out of their online services and you are stuck with having to save pdfs or printed out sheets to manage your bookings planes are average the typical smallish domestic aircrafts staff is polite tho in the good japanese fashion but they seriously need to stop excluding tourists from their online services not every tourists wants to use train when going long distances that will take more than hours with train,3
i had the pleasure of flying jal for the first time on vacation to the philippines flights i have to say i was truly impressed with the crew on all flights the flight attends are the best i fly a lot for business i get to see the good the bad the ugly but the jal attendants are the best in the business nice is an understatement you could tell how much pride they took in doing a great job always smiled even with unruly passengers they kept cool dealt with the issue i was seriously impressed with the crews i will update with my flights here are jal jal i will fly jal again recommend jal to my friends family leg room good food way above average actually really good check in was a breeze with the jal app planes very clean again to me its about the flight attendants how great they were it makes the flight,5
ive been spoiled with business class flights to asia wasnt fortunate enough to fly business on this flight we used aa miles for this flight the configuration of this plane has seats on the sides rather than so our family of sat and this way no crawling over sleeping strangers to get to the bathroom theres more legroom than most economy seats we were quite comfortable the food was pretty good as well,5
japan airlines has consistently been on the top airlines list and its easy to see why brand new planes good amenities and impeccable service the bathrooms are kept so clean which is hard to do on an overnight flight the food was beautifully prepare in typical japanese fashion and very tasty the only negative is the movie selection,5
bought a ticket by agency supersaverru but did mistake wrong sequence of name and surname unfortunatelly jal didnt agree to change sequence cause tickets boute by agency,2
we flew jal from melbourne airport to japan we were immediately impressed with the amount of leg room they have in economy they have a wide variety of entertainment for adults and kids they even have mini games but the food was lacking for kids the staff were very friendly overall jal is a really good airline and we would fly them again,5
jal business class wasnt that great the crew were really good the plane was really old a bit dirty and carpet was ripping in some places food wasnt that great either i tried the japanese menu coming back and it tasted weird the western menu on the way over wasnt too bad but for business class i would have expected better food the movies were really old no new releases and you couldnt turn the subtitles off on some of the movies compared to vietnam airlines we flew in may it doesnt compare on any scale i felt like i had stepped back in time on this flight to the s,3
i picked japan airlines purposely to experience japan and its people before actually stepping on japanese soil the best choice without question the best service ever if i had a choice i would not travel with anybody but this airliner nobody can touch them,5
the flight from narita was on one of the older planes a overall the business experience was okay i was surprised i did not receive anything or was told that i could use the express security line the japanese lounge was the highlight new modern with a great selection of food and drinks the flight was good the seat was comfortable and was practically flat the crew in business were all mature and did their job while not the best i have experienced and not the worse overall it was okay experience,4
took the flight recently with my family to japan the flight attendants very polite and offered good hospitality to all passengers always smiling and available we were impressed with the range of entertainment and new movies on offer the in flight meal is high quality compared to other airlines and is similar to japanese bento box with ice cream tried the japanese plum wines japanese branded beers and kiwi juices they offered in flight small souvenir to all young kids we loved the roomy leg rooms not squashed like some other economic airlines the aircraft has businesspremium and economy sections overall in flight experience better than usual airlines we travelled with best of all it is direct flight from sydney to tokyo saving us times in travel,5
for years i had been hearing that japan airlines was a very special experience in commercials and other media jal was always touted as having great service luxurious appointments and all that kind of thing the actual experience however was far different starting from the very first arrival at narita airport rather than having a nice special boarding area with such luxuries as a shower good food drinks and other things it was really no different than any plain old boarding area in any plain old budget class filled and i do mean filled with screaming infants harried travelers and other unpleasant things usually in any prestige waiting area you have nice food displays larger and more comfortable seats and things like that none of that was in evidence here add to that the shocking news that the wait for a shower would be three hours and you have the equivalent of having to wait for your flight in the psycho ward on the flight instead of luxury food and other service you got something not much different than coach service and food and the only thing i was glad of was that this was a flight at night and i could just go to sleep and forget all this dont ever look for me to fly jal ever again and i go to japan usually at least twice a year give me united any day,2
after spending two lovely weeks in thailand where both the people were incredibly handson and delightful with my year old i flew home alone with my toddler on jal from bangkok to tokyo had a hour layover and again from tokyo to jfk outbound we flew cathay pacific and they were incredibly kind with us doing anything to make the hour travels easier on us but jal only added stress on us jal to tokyo simply seemed nitpicky my son had the window shade down and they really needed it up on a plane of rows they also commented on his reusable stickers that leave zero residue which i showed them and then they needed them removed for the landing id understand if they had been real stickers but it seemed to be a sticking point for them pun intended they also kept serving more food before clearing any trash so i couldnt even take a meal for myself because theyd served the kids trays first and then all these snacks and drinks but never clears anything before adult meals i was buried in trash finally and this was the deal breaker for me on the way from tokyo to jfk i checked in online in advance and was about to drop my bag off at the luggage check when someone pointed me to family assistance in hong kong and thailand all security and airlines pulled us aside to prioritize us so i thought the same was to happen nope i had to drag my bag and stroller across the hallway where they insisted i was lbs too heavy for our one bag when i explained that were permitted four bags and ive only checked one they told me to put the extra lbs in my backpack this may not seem bad except when youre a pretty t revamping alone with a toddler and already managing your child along with carryons and a stroller i cant split into multiple bags so they told me to go all the way to the other end of international to the post office to buy a box and i had to old lbs into the box they told me it was no problem but what they failed to realize is that it is a problem as a parent already juggling a lot now i have to repack my bag at customs upon arrival i was furious and so appalled at the lack of service never again will i fly jal,1
i was so excited to bring my partner h to japan aboard this airline because of my great experiences with it in the past and how this was going to be her first time the initial flight to japan was very comfortable and we were practically singing our praises about the inflight food entertainment and service the return flight however was another story we understood that security would most likely be tighter since it was just in the wake of an iranian leaders death after passing security and customs smoothly which included facial recognition technology comparing us to our passport pictures we started boarding the plane at the gate an attendant who was checking the tickets overlooked h and skipped over to the person behind her in line once we boarded the plane flight attendants were greeting the passengers as they headed to their seats one of them asked to see hs passport inspected it closely and even dropped it on the floor she didnt do this to the passenger before h and when i offered my own passport to her she just sent me along without looking at it or touching it h felt singled out by this action as she was the only africanamerican passenger having your passport inspected at security would be one thing but that was done with no issues once youre past that and boarding the plane to be treated as suspicious because of your appearance only makes a person feel unwelcome we didnt complain about it to anyone at the time because we wanted to at least make sure we got home but now h doesnt want to travel with this airline again if it can be helped,1
although the selection of entertainment was not to my liking the two meals were amazing jal has moved to a young chef designed menu scheme and we had some really interesting and tasty choices apart from that the seats seemed larger than most other airlines and the service unobtrusive and effective,4
japan airlines has recently changed their handling of partner reward travel and gives travelers using economy miles center seats this is a new low and the first time i have seen this for a flight booked months in advance jal has really gone downhill quickly since i last flew them a year ago,1
given the choice i will always take jal their service is excellent it was also a direct flight from where i live to japan large selection of recent movies free drinks and good food and leg room in economy we were served specialty ice cream and cookies on route to japan on the return trip my son dropped his wallet changing in the lavatory and they found it and returned it to him,5
why cant jal install some kiosks rather than making most of the people on the airplane wait for hours on a ridiculously long line the manager told me that they had three kiosks last year but none of them were working so instead we have a disney style line that goes on forever,1
the attached picture is of jals customers waiting in line for an hour and a half at mnl because jal cant be bothered to install a kiosk to print out boarding passes and generate luggage tags the picture actually shows only a small part of the line japan airlines is horrible and should be avoided whenever possible jals employees are also worthless and ill informed jal should fire all of them and start from scratch,1
in september we flew melbourne tokyo narita new york jfk and back in jal economy the direct service from melbourne to tokyo is fairly new as it started on september and is very welcome the seats food aircraft and service are all superior to the qantas alternative which we have also flown recently qantas is using very old s whereas jal is using dreamliners and the difference in comfort lighting and particularly noise levels is very noticeable qantas really needs to lift its game jal claims that it had taken a seat out of each row and fitted wider seats and they were noticeably wider not by a huge amount but it all adds to the comfort we were seated in the exit row so the leg room was good but im cm tall and wouldve been happy with the standard seats as well the only negative is that the melbourne flight goes to narita rather than haneda so you spend about an hour longer getting to and from the airport and domestic connections are more timeconsuming we had to catch a bus from narita to haneda to catch our domestic connection the other negative is that jals inflight entertainment services isnt as good as some other airlines but at least its better than it used to be once we were back in australia and putting our points into the jal mileage bank i realised that it was also easier to earn rewards on jal than qantas so well probably use the points for upgrades on our next flights with jal,4
flight was good small airplane for this route so the business class wasnt really worth it but flight attendants were excellent however as business class and priority on luggage i had to wait minutes for my luggage when most other people received theirs already,4
japan airlines has the lowest fare from new york usa to manila the philippines the one we took leaves around in the morning and arrives in tokyo japan around in the afternoon there is a connecting flight to manila around but we stayed in tokyo for days and took a morning flight from tokyo to manila the service was excellent from checkin boarding in flight and disembarking the flight from narita to manila was also excellent another advantage of taking japan airlines was the flight from tokyo to kyoto domestic in japan fares for international travelers was lower than the fare for a train the flight from narita tokyo to kyoto and from kyoto to haneda tokyo and from narita to jfk new york were also excellent,5
compared with qatar and qantas seats are cramped leave a lot to be desired entertainment for english speakers was terrible really old movies a lot of shootmup ones and very few to choose from even an english speaking documentary was dubbed over with japanese and only japanese subtitles on such long flights it would have been nice to have pjs instead of cardigan food and service was fine,3
the best economy flight that i have ever taken to asiafirst of all is the seat itself it was just like premium economy seats on other airlines plenty of legroom even if you are six feet tall the flight attendants were so friendly and helpful i requested glutenfree meals and they were actually quite good i will only fly them from now onthey exceeded my expectations,5
the food was very good cabin crew were very friendly and courteous lots of inflight entertainment but a bit more expensive compared to ana,5
flew two trips four segments on jal in business class using miles from my american account miles one way in business class seemed like a great deal it turned out that you get what you pay for the transpacific flights sannrt nrtsan were in s jal uses the sky suite which is an innovative design that allows them to get a configuration where many airlines are using a the seat is comfortable and converts to a spacious fully flat seat nicely squared off the downside is that there is nowhere to store anything in fully flat mode the interasia flights hndsgn and tpenrt were in shell flat seat configuration which is angledflat not a great seat food was decent though not spectacular on the long flights theres a service just after takeoff and a second whenever you wish up to two hours before landing jal is promoting the top chefs who develop their menu but an airplane galley is not a great place for execution the food quality was variable service was generally very friendly and professional no faults here with one big execption at the international transfer desk in nrt after checking in i was told by the woman at the desk that there were two lounges that i could use one just upstairs and one closer to my gate but that the upstairs lounge was very nice and the one by the gate was not so good i was just going to sit and read and have a drink so i walked the mins to the lounge closer to the gate turns out that not so good means closed for renovation and had been so for some time and at this point i was too far out to make it back to the other lounge imo this is an inexcusable mistake on jals part,2
ive flown many airlines and this trip i flew legs from shanghai to hawaii with jal and i mist say they have the absolute best economy service ever that goes for ground staff to checkin staff to on board flight attendants they were all so friendly especially toward my son and helpful and professional the seats were comfortable the entertainment system was top notch my son got his child meals so quickly and they were excellent quality actually except for the leg leaving hawaii all the food was the best i have had on an airline in economy class bravo jal,5
japan airlines is an airline that will surely provide you the comfort service and care while crossing continents,5
jal uses jet for the route from sydney yo helsinki via tokyo the only downside for these flights are the extended transit time we have to spend an overnight at tokyo or narita airport hotel on our way from sydney and hours on our way from helsinki the seat is spacious compared to most airlines and on our way back to sydney we have been upgraded to business class sky suite lie flat is possible from helsinki to tokyo,4
i would like to specially thank ms stephanie wong stewardess on my japan airlines flight jl code share with american airlines flight aa i can feel her earnest attentive service attitude towards all passengers she would occasionally checked on passengers if we need anything to make our hours minutes transpacific flight more comfortable she is very polite and wellmannered hooray to ms stephanie wong a star service thank you,5
excelent flights with jal disappointed with return ba with jal food and service was excellent and inflight films ba disorganised and minimalistic tried hard but lacked basics,5
always satisfied jals services and hospitality all cabin crues watch everybody with their warm eyes if you wnat to request something one of cabin crues walk up to you without your voice it is amaging this is omotenashi japanese style hospitality also flight is always on time you never forget,5
although it was a twelve hour flight in economy it was such a pleasant flight the onboard service was top notch and all the flight attendants made the experience worth to positively remember the plane an almost brand new dreamliner was silent comfy and really pleasant ive flown dozens of airlines and jal is one ot the best in long haul along with finnair ba lufthansa air france tap delta emirates and turkish a,5
like everything in japan the plane was exceptionally clean and the staff incredibly gracious i booked with american airlines and could not be happier that i was put on jal,5
i recently travelled to japan with japan airlines it was the first time i have travelled with them and it wont be the last the plane was new and very clean and the service was even better both flights crews were pleasant and very polite i highly recommend them,5
a brilliant experience for long haul we were in economy good food meals snacks and complementary drinks blanket pillow great choice of movies audio news games staff couldnt do enough so friendly would recommend,5
would never fly this airline again missed my inward leg but told by jal staff wouldnt be a problem on return leg but upon trying to check in told ticket had been cancelled as standard jal policy then told only one seat left and is business class i paid for that then was handed an economy seat and asked if i wanted a window aisle seat when i questioned this they lied again saying theyd not said it was business class was x the original return ticket one way and then when i get on board there are empty seats in economy class would never recommend or use this airline again,1
given what i had heard i was expecting a much better experience having been on any long haul flights id say this was no better than average food in pe was not as good as id hoped and service was only ok we paid quite a bit exrta for what proved to be just a bit more room,3
the seats were spacious and i cnnot believe how efficient the airport staff are when the plane was being docked,5
i have not taken jal for many years and found my experience very positive this time the check in was very fast and easy my plane was a boeing and the interior was clean and pleasant the seat was comfortable with a reasonable amount of leg room the service was very straight forward and efficient which was typical of japan it was a stress free and relaxing flight overall,5
xxxxxxxxxxxx visit for all world and take a more enjoy next trip japan xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxcvvvxxbbbbb nnjjh nj jk hubby bubble njbbbjjb job jhb,5
if possible avoid the sky suite iii configuration i much prefer sky suite ii theres more room and privacy configuration iii is like a coffin the tv equipment is bulky and theres no room to wiggle cathay has a similar seat but they were astute enough to carve out some space below the side console as others have said jl really lacks in the ife department i tend to watch on my own tablet i wanted to watch a korean film called parasite but it was only available in japanese subtitles wth jal really shines when it comes to the japanese meal option however they should offer one more western option not everyone likes to eat red meat moreover after having flown jl a few times i long for something besides simmered burdock or braised fish the fas are pleasant polite and check up on pax frequently i try to seek jal when flying to japan and beyond because im an alaska mileage plan member however im leaning more towards ana these days theyre consistent with their business class seat offerings meanwhile jl has three international versions why the sakura lounge in nrt is solid but i actually prefer the admirals club sadly theyre closing in mar,3
the plane was not cramped one can freely move around without bumping into something or someone i dread airplane bathrooms but jals are different they are clean odor less and the one i got in had a full length mirror i have been flying all my life with different airlines but jal is the one for me from now on,5
i anticipated this years holiday to be special but had no idea to hear extent my so and i were planning our annual international vacation and as luck would have it came across relatively cheap flights to japan in december heres the catch it included a brief layover in dallas seattle on the return flight but certainly more tolerable than that in hong kong virtually any layover is preferable to that of twentythree hours at the hk airportthe flight into narita was fairly smooth as the airline staff provided utmost courtesy and comfort i will say with utmost bconfidence that the economy seats at jal singlehandedly top united my other favorite midpriced international airline american airlines sorry to say do not come close either in the staffs attitudes nor in the food and entertainment selections jal provides a succinct snapshot of the culture itself unadulterated cleanliness customer care and courtesy that is genuine rather than one projected by fake smiles as par for the course of a flight into japan we experienced somewhat frequent turbulence an aerial version of an earthquake as if were it seemed to occur almost on cue while the staff served and poured beverages naturally my red wine added a splash of color to the tray table the program selection was excellent as i was able to dive headlong into japanese cinema and get in the zone for my trip every venture into the country feels new and fresh regardless of the frequency with which i visit this was my third time abs certainly will be one of many more to come especially if it is via jal,4
the service always great on asian airlinesthe business class seats were lay downs but narrow gave out blanket but no duvet meals were so so nothing outstanding movie selections were good would fly again with them,4
i flew lax osaka on jal and returned tokyonarita lax on american i never thought that id say this but american airlines was more comfortable aside from very good dinner on jal business class was only marginally better than comfort class on other airlines the seats were very cramped with a lot of space taken by a very bulky console between the two seats when in the flat position for sleeping the whole seat was raised making it an even more cramped situation it was brutally hot during the flight and when i asked about it the attendant said that there was nothing that could be done i understand from friends who were in coach that after multiple requests to lower the temperature their cabin became more comfortable amenity kits were nothing special the wine was housewine quality and other than the dinner the food was average and the entertainment choices were very limited especially for a flight of that length on the return flight on american the seats were definitely more spacious and comfortable the service was acceptable and the cabin personnel were attentive i have friends who have asked my opinion about which airline to use and contrary to my general policy of avoiding aa i found that on this this routing american was superior to jal,3
we really enjoyed flying with jal as the title of our review suggests the jal staff are well organized respectful and welcoming the service is very good too we really like their flying schedule and chose to fly to delhi via tokyo on jal after comparing it with airlines that fly across the atlantic there were a couple of areas that could do with improvement the specially prepared chef meals can be a hit or a miss and on the flight from tokyo to san diego the food was very unappetizing we also did not understand why on the daytime flight from san diego to tokyo they darkened the cabin for daylight hours when ones internal clock should be on daylight time this did not make any sense unless jal was trying somehow to reduce activity and service to save money it felt a bit manipulative otherwise the flights were very comfortable restrooms were always clean and the pilots were excellent landing gently on different runways,4
i had about an hour between connecting flights and made use of the jal first class lounge at narita near gate the lounge is under renovation the upstairs renovation is completed so the dining area upstairs is in great condition and well equipped as for the main floor more than half the lounge area is now closed for renovation so there is only a seating area on the main floor with all dining moved upstairs the upstairs dining area now serves food to order instead of a buffet there is a sushi station offering a set of three different pieces of sushi which selection changes every week there is also a noodle station offering a choice of two different soup noodles which you order and then are given a device which will signal when your order is ready finally there are two stations offering western and japanese style dishes made to order such as pasta or on this visit chicken in mushroom cream sauce on a side island station there are serveral breads and pastries and soups for self service all the food i tried was very good and presented on beautiful plates too the flight boarded on time at pm for the pm flight the flight is operated with a b with rows of seats each in business class configured xx i had seat a a window seat that is nicely positioned next to the window with a cabinet next to it between the seat and the aisle for greater privacy row and the other odd numbered rows have the opposite arrangement with the seat next to the aisle and the cabinet next to the window business class was not full on the flight with about empty seats the seat is the sky suite ii fully horizontal flatbed seat when reclined to the bed position the bed lies very low to the ground sleep was fairlly comfortable on the seat in bed position but the bed is quite narrow if sleeping on ones back rather than side there were two meal services dinner shortly after takeoff and then breakfast about hours before landing for dinner there was a choice of a japanese meal or two different western meals the japanese set starts with a bento box of many different items followed by a main of marinated chicken and yellowtail teriyaki with rice ending with a dessert of sesame pudding the western meals both start with several horsdoeuvres and then a main of either roasted japanese beef sirloin or olive flounder with clams ending with a dessert of a cream puff stuffed with bitter chocolate cream and yuzu confit for breakfast the choice was between the japanese set with simmered pork or the western set with an omelette with bolognese sauce i had the japanese choice with both meals but opted for the chocolate cream puff dessert from the western menu instead for dinner all the food was beautifully presented and delicious i also made a point of having coffee at both meals since jal serves special monthly chosen coffee in business class on its flights in fact the menu has a description of the monthly coffee in the same way as the available wines and sakes are introduced between take off and preparation for landing and the two meal service almost half of the hr min flight time was used up so i only managed about hours of sleep on the flight service in business class on the flight was wonderful as usual the cabin staff were very efficient and gracious in meal service and clean up were constantly going through the cabin to see if passengers needed anything else and constantly cleaned the toilets so they were always in good condition our flight landed on time and first bags were delivered to the luggage carousel promptly within about minutes after landing another wondeful flight on jal superb gracious service and great food,5
i wish i could give them less than a one they messed up my reservation and didnt care didnt try to fix it put effort in every flight i flew left late and arrived late i could go onbut why,2
this was a great flight the service was amazing get to check in early and request a goo seat take some movies with you,5
this was a great flight cabin service was excellent the entertainment selection could be more varied,5
having flown several asian airlines i had high expectations for jal flight from tokyo to san francisco additionally having just spent time in japan and knowing what service levels are there i was looking forward to the business class service i was doomed for disappointment service was relatively slow compared to other airlines and our specially requested vegetarian meal was bleh truly unappetizing a complete opposite to the service and food in asian air in which we flew across to asia,2
one of the few good oneworld airlines with qatar airways flew economy on very modern planes out back with wellappointed cabins compares well with emirates much better than ba or lh service was friendly food was pleasant makes a change and imaginative service was friendly the best choice for a direct flight lhrhnd,5
japan airlines has very clean aircraft and the cabin crew are always impeccably neat the food is ok and substantial then again this is on the meal provider the politeness of the japanese is legendary and cannot be more displayed the crew bows before the waiting passengers before they board it is always almost on schedule when everyone is asleep snacks are available in the galley their home narita has the cleanest rest rooms,4
had a pretty long flight arround hours even though i didnt pay for any premium service or had extras the attention was excellent im a really tall person and usually struggle a little with the economic airlines because my legs dont fit but in jal it was all the opposite sits are comfortable space for the legs is okay space in the restroom was perfect for even stretching myself the food is incredible had lovely meals tea and snacks they give you pillow blanket slippers headphones three meals and hot towels to clean yourself the enternetainment was okay recent cool movies and series,5
this was my first trip flying on jal and after hearing a few positive things i decided to book their long haul flight from london to tokyo direct i was travelling to japan for the rugby world cup and the quarter final was the day i was due to arrive so i was anxious having not used jal previously of possible delays i should not have been worried as not only did the flight leave early but it also got in early the flight was just under hours which played havoc on my knees and back however the attendants were always on hand with an extra cushion drink or additional food of which i took advantage of each time i am and there was good leg space in economy and my only issue was on the return flight when the individual in front of me reclinded their seat for the best part of four hoursno fault of jal of course overall it was a good flight with efficent timing and atentive staff would recommend and use again for any future japan visits,4
easy check in online and then extremely quick baggage drop off comfortable seat with good leg room onboard service was great flight attendants were excellent ordered boarding instead of the usual rush and you actually had free space in the overhead locker,5
our first time to fly jal and we absolutely loved it the flight was on time and boarding was orderly the cabin crew are so gracious and attentive food is good they even serve wine in economy i was not able to view the inflight entertainment because the flight was short but my husband enjoyed watching some movies already planning our next flight using jal,5
very comfortable seatsbeds with mattress if required nice touch service was attentive and friendly and food and refreshments were of a high quality entertainment could have been better though i felt there was a limited choice of films compared to other airlines flights were on timeearly and all in all a very pleasant experience,4
i was looking to book through japan air because of the very good service they have on board flying attendants are always smile check on passengers all the time food is great many movies to watch i would definitely recommend to fly by japan air,5
comfortable seats awesome wine list food portion enough but have room for improvement wide selection of movies which is a big advantage very polite server,4
pleasant flights to and from kuala lumpur on this airline one of the few airlines that actually have a bit of extra leg room service is good and no complaints with meals or service try not to fly to australia via singapore on jal as they code share with qantas out of singapore and their flights are not as good and neither is the planes used,4
we have used this flight from narita to honolulu st thing we were welcomed with was even though we have used coach class we have reserved to use sakura lounge prior to flight through one of our credit card service provider as a benefit of its card we were welcomed with hard rejection of the lounge usage and lounge receptionists werent helping much kept telling us we were not registered we were sure that we were registered to use the lounge but it was not on their record nd thing on the returning flight when they deliver meals to us we were sitting at the end row and one of the choices meal they had run out that could happen because again it is an economy class but the food provided as a result was enormously bad taste i have been using multiple airlines in my life maybe or so but it was the worst of all i had to spit out and didnt even touch the rest it was the same for rest of the people in my group we were group of the other meal provided on the same flight was also extremely terrible not sure how to describe but they should be serving purchased bento or sandwich box at the airport instead of such terrible meals it was way over the limit even it is for economy class it was cheaply priced flight for sure but they should at least give us some dignity,2
first time on this airline new with good seat configuration meaning more room than my previous flight on a ba which had great food great entertainment and movies excellent service very comfortable would definitely fly with them again,4
nice variety of entertainment up to date movie list great food and drink great service comfortable seat,5
it was difficult to get seat assignments early on japan airlines so we had to take what we got which wasnt a problem after all the economy section on jal is very good its roomier than others and has that wonderful japanese service,4
the whole experience was excellent i hated the idea of a hour flight but it was made so easy with attentive staff great seats wide deep and comfortable lots of leg room and plenty of storage space there was a sense of calm and quiet not normally experienced on most airlines i would definitely use them again,5
there is no doubt that the hospitality of the airline staff on japan airlines was the best ever in over years of air travel the plane was exceptionally clean the seats were the best ever large spacious it was a boeing series flight very smooth bit the key talking point was the closeby pass of mount fuji everyone got up took photos exchanged pleasantries very social and many shared learning excellent value beats all airlines that i have ever flown on hands down in economy class,5
we flew round trip in premium economy in october to and november from stellar service the cabin crew is unfailingly polite helpful and attentive if only all airlines could offer this level of service the onboarding process in both directions was breathtakingly organized and efficient the best two onboarding experiences in all our years of travel it really makes you wonder why it cant always be that way dont make something simple something hard comfort the premium economy seats are comfortable and certainly worth the price the restrooms are cleaned and restocked so frequently that they are always fresh and pleasant to use nuts and bolts the power outlets in either of our seats did not work in either direction and that was a downer particularly on such a long flight underseat storage in front of you is limited but better than some others the headphones werent great and outlets didnt accept our headphones the movie selection was poor and resolution not great on the flight between jfk and haneda the plane was so hot it kept us awake the flight back was very pleasant food we have read here that many people liked the food on their flights we found it awful really awful both flights the best and saving grace was the ramen noodle cups made available on our return flight despite the negatives we view jal very favorably they treat people very well and the kindness and consideration shown by their personnel ncluding check in is exemplary premium economy is comfortable and good value we will likely fly jal preferentially whenever possible,4
great services good food excellent crews reasonable price ground service is also amazing staffs are full of service mind,5
the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful the food if you enjoy japanese fare for economy class this was five star the seats were very cramped checkin was easy too this is certainly one of the worlds better airlines but our first choice ana is better but their scheduledestinations did not suit,4
my first flight to japan was on jal i made sure the aircraft was a for the many hidden comfort features built into that particular model aircraft i was well pleased with the result jal configured seating on the boeing aircraft in economy international with their e configuration resulting in seats across better than many competitors who use seats across cabin comfort in the due to better air better humidity and lower noise was excellent the crew was helpful efficient unobtrusive and friendly the flight path chosen by the captain avoided turbulence while reaching our destination on time if you like to avoid surprises jal is a solid choice the mother with infant who was seated in our bulkead row center section was given a wallmount bassinet allowing the infant to sleep comfortably and quietly directly in front of okasan the cost was very affordable though i did not compare airlines to search for cheaper fares videoaudio entertainment was good meals were amazing with stainless flatwarein eonomy seriously so im not even going to look at any other airlines for my next trip to japan or other east asia destinations then there is this note japan airlines jal was awarded by customers for featuring the worlds best economy class and the best economy class airline seat at the at the skytrax world airline awards held at the paris air show,5
braced myself for the usual loooong haul flight from manila to usa via haneda to my surprise it didnt seem that long because of the comfort the whole flight offered i was pleasantly surprised to realize the seats were not as cramped as i recall the crew was excellent and flights left and arrived on time,4
the service from jal staff both on the ground and in the air is excellent weve flown jal several times to and from japan and prefer to fly this airline than any other their customer service via phone resolved an issue i had quickly and efficiently,5
การบรการ ระหวางเดนทาง ดมาก พนกงานใหบรการบนเครองบนทเปนทงชาวไทย และชาวญปน มความใสใจกบผโดยสารมาก หองนำสะอาด ทนงสบาย อาหารรสชาตด ถงทหมายตรงเวลา very good service all cabin crew flight attendants are trained with very good service mind cleanness airline comfortable seat and food is very tasty meal jal is recommended airline,4
found a great deal on cheapoair rt lax to bkk business class dont splurge often but glad i did this time i was greeted personally by the crew supervisor by name before takeoff and again before landing to make sure everything was good the food service seat and entertainment were excellent you must try the japanese menu at least once amazing cannot wait for the return flight,5
so polite and well mannered nothing was a problem efficient and very friendly for an economy flight i really enjoyed it,5
i took jal economy class for my flight return jakartatokyo and osakatokyojakarta on november its a nice filght experience starts from the airport ground to the airplane cabin the whole service was great easy checkin and baggage procedures ontime boarding and departing even the pilot crew appologize for mins delay due to takeoff queue spacy legroom great inflight entertainment delicious inflight meals and free flow drinks the cabin crew also very polite and helpful its really worthed flight,5
overall the flight was pleasant and smooth nothing in particular to specifically highlight the crew were professional and courteous all along and have pleasant smiles the in flight entertainment was enjoyable though there wasnt a great selection to choose from the food being served were nice,4
i recently flew a leg trip from saigonhanedajfk iverall it was a great travel experience the gate staff were professional and courteous we boarded saigon on time haneda a minute delay but arrived both times a little ahead of schedule my seats on both the and er were comfortable large compared to us and other asian carriers ive flown with good legroom and mobility and everything was clean this has always been my experience on japan airlines i had a lot of in flight movies tv and music programs to choose from western and international with or without subtitles my choice the food and cabin service was good and the flight attendants courteous and professional good eye contact and respectful giving me their full attention when they were addressing me thank you ms bando i had confidence that they would be able to handle any situation the entire cabin was nicely appointed and the lavatories were always clean the flight attendants see to that excellent job not everyones favorite my seat the carpeting and the tray tables were well maintained and clean too not always the case on most other airlines ive flown at hours flying time its definitely a long haul but my experience onboard made it one of the best economy experiences ive had this was also a great value i paid usd round trip which is a highly competitive fare combined with the service aircraft and baggage allowance it was a great value domo arigato japan airlines,5
i used this airline on january fly for about hours from jakarta with stop at narita and continue to sapporo the staffs start from check in counter and cabin crews were so kind friendly and helpful the flight itself was very clean and i have smooth fly experience with them the food was good and we have free flow waterjuice everytime we need with snacks in between you wont feel hungry if you fly with them oh ya i love the ice cream the option of videos are vary you can choose music movie news etc without feel bored so i enjoy my first fly with japan airlines good job keep the good service,5
standard flight to san diego only because i was coming home did it feel good it was nonstop and the only way i want to fly connections are too dangerous these days jal on whole was a good flight crew attentive and fairly comfortable for economy,4
i read reviews before booking most commented that there was leg room in economy and its true the price was right and so grateful i could fly into logan airport boston some reviews said the food was terrible but that was not my experience it was a breeze to check in online and get boarding passes i generally cannot get boarding passes printed in advance on other international airlines,4
japan airline may be a little more expensive but the extra legroom and service is well worth it this was especially good for me as i had an overnight return flight and was refreshed ready for work when i landed back in sydney,5
i have flown a number of other airlines including another trip to japan approximately months prior with ana ana was okay and i had no complaints but jal went above and beyond the cabin crew were attentive and friendly the seats were comfortable the food was delicious and the flight seemed to go quickly with us arriving relatively relaxed and refreshed i couldnt recommend jal more and only wish they flew from sydney to more destinations,5
excellent service and pod lie down seats food was very good and flight attendants helpful flight time of hours was fine with these seats and entertainment options,5
i couldnt have asked for a better airline everything from the lounges service food and seating was first class i have been doing this trip every year for the past years and have never had a lost suitcase and have never had any delays treat yourself this is a great airline,5
jal continues to be one of the better international carriers that ive flown would highly recommended,5
second time to fly with jal both experiences the same friendly from the moment you leave the ground until you touch it again no sour faces like other airlines tend to have so much leg room down the back the food is outstanding the drink choices amazing and the toilets always clean and seem more spacious than other airlines give them a go you wont need to think twice the only thing that could be improved is the entertainment particularly the music selection and tv series stars from us,5
food is good they feed you wellstaff is very nice no attitudes seats are comfortable and movies on seats chargers for phoneplenty drinks even two bloody mariesi love japan airlines and ibhave flown a lot,5
excellent food presentation and taste staff are courteous and professional i would not hesitate to fly with them again worth all your benjamims,5
i am a very nervous flyer so i was not looking forward to the hour flight to japan we travelled premium ecomony because of the fact that i am nervous so wanted to be as comfortable as possible and it was definately worth paying extra as the seats were very roomy and comfortable with plenty of leg room i spoke with a member of the crew and explained that i was nervous so he asked my name and checked on me regulary throughout the flight to make sure i was ok the bathrooms were kept very clean but now having been to japan and seen how clean the country is its understandable why the planes are so clean i forgot to mention the boarding process at frankfurt and how amazing quick it was premium economy boarded and the we were ready to go but we did not even realise that economy had even boarded so we guessed they boarded both at the same time but at different entrances the only downside was the food none of it was good which was disappointing but then again plane food is never good overall the flight was good and the staff were great and i would recommend japan airlines with no hesitation i just hope i get to fly with them again we loved japan too so it is likely we will go back,5
japan airlines is highly rated but sitting in economy you dont feel like theyre going out of their way for you you are at the bottom of four class levels and you really feel it food service is hurried and limited not a lot of selections for drinks movie selections were limited that said you are no doubt getting bigger seats than on any american airline and they do have direct flights from nyc i would take them again for those reasons but not gladly our flight to tokyo was probably made worse by a child who cried loudly practically the entire way there the plane was pretty much full so no possibility to move further away from the crying fourteen and a half hours on a plane is probably too much for a year old child parents probably need to look into some sort of sleep aid for a child of that age otherwise they are being very inconsiderate of other passengers,3
surprised by a flight all business or first i was so glad that i could stretch out sleep not possible however,4
we raided the piggy bank for business class owing to the length of the flight i had prior experience with jal a number of years ago and it has gotten even better comfortable pods with legroom to stretch out and sleep im and the mattresses they provide were extremely comfortable flight attendants were courteous attentive competent and seriously attractive in stylish uniforms food both japanese and western was excellent our return flight was from haneda airport and we availed ourselves of their business class lounge while waiting to board best ive ever seen ありがとうございました arigatōgozaimashita,5
i flew to tokyo by jal in november for two weeks visit in japan the service on sky is excellent and cabin crew were always plite with gentle smile food was lovely and snacks were always given away between as well the entertainment didnt bore me out in the toilet cubicles there were handwritten messages from the crews on the day it was heartwarming it is a long flight but jal will give you a comfortable journey for sure,5
enjoyed my week trip nonstop direct flight aboard boeing on jal from jfk ny to narita japan and return on jal this composite plane allows more pleasant humidity level thus avoiding that typical dry scratchy feeling and a little more leg room the stewardesses are polite pleasant efficient and work hard to keep everyone happy my return trip was a bonus had seats to myself to stretch out and sleep sideways on this trip i got a prepaid sim card at narita arrival for my unlocked iphone good for month unlimited data g for us it worked out great got all my emails text google gps without worrying about data use or if wifi available for phone conversation use in japan or to call my friends and family in usa for free used apps whatsapp and line whatsapp worked flawlessly for text photos videos video calls and phone calls,5
flight is on time flight stewardess are friendly and accomodating as always it must be the japanese culture,4
for long haul flights i will choose japan airlines whenever i can their economy seat is better than most airlines ive taken and the meals served are quite decent some flights can be quite packed because of the configuration but besides that ive mostly had good experiences with jal,4
excellent airline even though economy the seats were spacious enough the food was delicious the hostesses attentive movie and audio were better than the average airline,5
im only tall and even i feel the pinch of not enough legroom but there was plenty on this flight the staff were more than friendly and attentive the food was very good for airline food too this is a win,5
impressed with the hospitality and the way they take care of small details the quality of food and taste was so good and they were happy to customized as per my needs i m sure would love to travel again with them,4
amazing flight with jal they are so efficient friendly and great i highly recommend this flight and airline,5
i took jals overnight flight from tokyo haneda to bangkok in business class prior to departure i visited the lounge as jals first class lounge in haneda is closed for renovation first class passengers and jal and oneworld elite members ie emerald are directed to the sakura skyview lounge instead on the th floor near gate the lounge was very spacious with lots of seating in the buffet dining area and elsewhere the buffet had a good selection of food including jals trademark beef curry but does not have any made to order stations as found in jals first class lounge in narita and before in haneda the lounge was not very busy when i got there around pm for my am flight it picked up a bit closer to pm but there were still plenty of seats for everyone to stretch out a bit with empty seats buffers for all i made my way to my gate a bit early and lined up in group for oneworld emeralds and jal top tier members jal sorts passengers into groups and has separate lines for each group very orderly uncharacteristically the flight was late in boarding by about to minutes as a result pushback was also late at about am for the am scheduled flight take off was about am with the video monitor showing a flight time of hours minutes the flight was operated with a b equipped with the sky suite iii horizontal fully flatbed seat laid out xx in business class i had the first window seat a which was nice as it was on the side with an additional toilet at the front and the front galley was located on the other side of the plane so there was no galley noise or traffic near my seat the downside for seat a is that it only has one window whereas most other window seats appear to have two windows the sky suite iii seat is a bit unusual in that it does not have a leg rest that can be raised in recline position like the sky suite ii seat instead the entire seat just slides forward and flattens out for recline to a flatbed when fully reclined to the bed position the passengers legs fit into quite a deep hole under the video screen but as a result the exit space to the aisle is located quite high up the body when lying down so it is a bit difficult to exit to the aisle from the bed position there is a small storage cabinet on the window side of the seat to store the headphones and the bottled water provided on boarding and there is another storage space under the armrest on the aisle side which can be raised or lowered with the aisle side armrest lowered there is extra width to the seat in bed position but i found the material of the armrest to be a bit too hard to comfortably rest my arms on it as opposed to on the cushioned seat that said and also perhaps because it was a late night flight i found the sky suite iii to be quite comfortable to sleep in and slept for about ½ hours on the flight on boarding business class passengers found a form at their seat for them to fill in as to breakfast preference i opted to be woken up for breakfast and chose the japanese menu as soon as we took off and the seatbelt sign was turned off i reclined my seat to bed position and fell asleep fairly quickly about two hours before landing the lights were turned on and breakfast was served as usual the japanese meal was both beautifully presented and delicious i also had some coffee as jal serves special coffee in business class sourced from a coffee hunter based in tokyo the coffee is always excellent and jal even includes a description of the coffee of the month in the menu with growing region background and tasting notes just like for wines our flight landed a few minutes early at am immigration was quick as business class passengers have use of the premium lane which only had a couple of people in each line therefore i was at the luggage carousel before the first bags started arriving about half an hour after our flight landed one of the benefits of an overnight flight is that bangkoks notorious traffic is not a factor at all and i was able to get into the city center in only about half an hour with the light traffic of early morning,5
we enjoyed our long flight on jal checkin was efficient and friendly the was clean with the longest seat pitch in economy that we have experienced recenltly the flight staff were well groomed friendly and provided excellent service the meals served were very goodbetter than us carriers accompanied by a good selection of complimentary beverages including beer wine and champagne the entertainment system was good with an excellent set of earphones that were provided,5
travelled on their b on their rd flight to hnd of the day ground service was polite as usual unable to purchase j class as it was a full flight plane was new newspaper and sweets souvenirs were given at the entrance upon boarding round of drinks were provided in this hr of the flight newly furburised seats were of light made material with minimal padding and recline however legroom was better than the europrean flights within europe individual air vents were available at each seat it provided some relief as the air con was not switched on during take off and landing jal inflight and ground service are as exceptional as always,5
i also returned on jal and both directions were top service and comfort i had paid extra for legroom and felt on both flights that i was at home in my comfy chair in front of my tv when i return to the east i will book wherever possible jal,5
i havent flown with them yet but they have stunned me with their profoundly poor customer service and amateurish communications they changed my flight notifying me in a poorly written note that included only a phone number from within japan the only available number for jal inside the us was overwhelmed sometimes busy and did not have an option for me so they hung up eventually they didnt address my companions ticket or changes for a connecting flight and my locator number no longer works and so forth and so on i wrote them through their website and received another strangely poor note asking me to just write them back without addressing the several issues they created seriously this is a major airline i really thought theyd be efficient i cant believe ta named them fifth best in the world,1
great customer service on board friendly crew smooth flight it was one of the quieter planes ive been in and even though we were told there might be turbulence it seemed a very comfortable flight they serve plenty of food on this hour flight i just found it rather bland but thats just me,4
i wrote my review of this flight but was unable to upload photos of the cx lounge and jal flight earlier here are the photos,5
ive flown jal business class several times not the best business class but im happy with it the service by the flight attendants was great the actual flight was comfortable flight departed on time and hours later with a minute stop at tokyo narita to change planes for another hours flying time to manila it actually seemed quite quick now to get over the jet lag thanks jal see you again,4
travelled to kmq on their first flight out from hnd on a full flight at am we were terribly late and reached the check in counter mins before the flight ground staff were kind to print our boarding pass and personally escort us to the gate with our big suitcases the suitcases were loaded to the aircraft at the boarding gate flight crew were courteous and did one round of drink service seats had little padding and recline however leg room was good they deserve a star rating in skytrax,5
good service nice smooth flight seat is not the best but plenty of leg room no complaints arrived on time flying pe grated access to jal private lounge in narita upon landing while waiting for connecting flight very good lounge so i would recommend,5
japan airlines was at one time our airline of choice well times have changed we family of three missed our red eye flight am from tokyo to bangkok our mistake regarding the date and we took full responsibility by purchasing tickets from another airline because japan air could not help us get to thailand the return portion of the flight remained unchanged but to our dismay japan airlines cancelled our entire flight without warning they had our email address and phone numbers when we arrived to the bangkok airport for return to tokyo seat assignments in hand they said that our tickets had been cancelled even though there were empty seats in their flight the japan airlines officials refused to honor any portion of our paid tickets or to put us on the flight our option pay for new one way tickets on thai air very nice by the way and wait for hours in the bangkok airport next time we will just avoid the headache and skip japan airlines entirely they would not even give us the frequent flyer mileage we paid for stingy and bureaucratic would be two words to describe that behavior shockingly when they use japan in their name a country that excels at customer service,1
jal premium economy proved to be not only an excellent value way to travel to japan but an excellent way to start my time in japan a dedicated check in line was swiftly able to check in me in then provide an express path card for departure security and immigration one of the great things jal offers for premium economy guests is business class lounge access both in sydney and tokyo the qantas lounge is pleasant enough more so early on before it gets crowded with a reasonable selection of food and drinks big plus is the barista made coffee after heading to the gate priority boarding is offered also the premium seats are very comfortable both in width and pitch with a dedicated leg rest and foot rest also provided a comfortable blanket pillow was waiting on arrival along with a basic amenity kit more than adequate for this flight recline was excellent and being a shell seat you wont have anyone reclining into your space or legroom on the food front food is the same as economy with the addition of a few drinks such as sparkling wine and sake food was of high quality by economy standards for both taste and presentation udon noodles are available in between meals and a small snack bar is available also in the galley entertainment wise jal is definitely lacking compared to other carriers however there was more than enough to pass the time wifi is available and is reasonably priced the crew were warm engaging and helpful both during meal services and otherwise,5
i flew jal from vancouver to narita in business class prior to the flight i opted to use the cathay pacific lounge rather than the plaza premium third party lounge offered by jal since the cx lounge is much nicer and much less crowded plaza premium allows anyone to enter by paying always crowded as usual excellent service in the cx lounge particularly as the jal flight is about a half hour earlier than the cx flight so the cx passengers largely had not arrived at the lounge yet when i was there cx offers the noodle bar with hot food to order and also a side buffet with sandwiches salads desserts i tried the chicken risotto quite good but a bit too salty and shrimp dumplings wrapping stuck to the paper so both dumplings ripped open when i tried to pick them up but did not want more food since i had to save room for the great meal service on jal general boarding for the pm flight commenced promptly at pm preboards those who require assistance and young children started earlier around pm jal has switched to a b instead of the b dreamliner for this route the tradeoff is an older plane but better seats in business class with sky suite ii fully flat bed seats instead of the angle flat shell flat neo on the b dreamliner the seats are configured xx with just rows and seats in the business class cabin considerably less than the to seats on the dreamliner configured xx every seat has direct aisle access and the window seats alternate rows with a console beside the seat on the window side or the aisle side my seat a has the console on the aisle side so provided a bit more privacy from what happens in the aisle in addition to converting to a fully flat bed the sky suite ii seats also have a lower back massage function which felt quite nice the flight was slightly late on pushback due to some passengers boarding a bit late and then there was quite a wait after pushback before the plane started to move to taxi and ultimately take off was a bit after pm the flight was not very full in business class with about empty seats out of though one was being used as a pilot rest seat as always a highlight of the flight are the meal services with each meal being beautifully presented i had the japanese meal for the lunch served after take off which started with a bento box of delicious and visually attractive starters then rice with both salmon and sukiyaki beef and finished with the lemon mousse cake dessert jal serves a special coffee in business class and the menu describes in detail the coffee of the month much as a wine review would describe a wine as a result i always have at least a couple of cups of coffee on jal flights for the second meal i chose the western option of a ham and cheese frittata also good but was disappointed the croissant came bare without any butter or jam there appeared to be at least cabin stewards including the purser attending to the small business class cabin so service was very attentive and always courteous and excellent they seem to be constantly cleaning the toilets even taking the time to fold the toilet paper into a triangle at the end a gentleman was celebrating his birthday that day and the cabin crew actually brought him a bottle of champagne a little fruit plate and a small gift bag and sang happy birthday to him cabin staff even went around to the other guests to ask them to join in the celebration the entertainment system is a bit weaker in selection than perhaps cathay pacific partly because many selections are japanese only due to the time of the flight i did not sleep much as it was mostly afternoon and early evening vancouver time but did find the flat bed comfortable enough for napping the flight was quite turbulent and at the wrong times during both meal service for the second meal service the turbulence was sufficient to cause the cabin crew to serve coffee in a paper cup with a plastic lid instead of a ceramic cup due to a combination of the late pushback and takeoff and probably a relatively long flight time we arrived around minutes late perhaps this was the reason we had a remote stand and had to walk down steps and be bused to the terminal arriving around pm into narita is a horrible time for immigration lineups with so many arriving passengers flooding towards the passport control counters that airport staff had to hold up signs indicating where the end of the queue line was all told it took about minutes from the plane touching down on the runway to my exiting into the arrivals hall after passport control and customs there is no priority immigration lane that can be used by jal business class passengers so everyone just joins the general line all in all another excellent flight on jal with excellent service and food,5
what a dump this airlines is i highly do not recommend anyone to fly with japan airlines particularly for long flights firstly they starve you with insufficient meals on board their solution to this is to provide you with instant noodles when you are starving great so no just starve you but make you malnuourished at the same time secondly they try to blind you with overly bright fluorescent lighting both in the plane as well as when youre in transit in narita airport unless you love fluorescent lighting i advise you to avoid this airline at all costs thirdly when you then had enough of their crappy service and you go to cancel the return flight while in boston they put you on hold for an hour just to cancel the flight no cancellation via internet allowed i dont know why is this the s all in all a nightmare experience created by the japanese like youre caught in some bad hentai movie with no escape and with crappy lights to boot,1
i am an american airline aa member and have recently booked my flight between chicago and japan using aa mileage points from chicago to japan there is only one aa flight service so i had no choice to book the aa flight operated by japan airline jal then i tried to select my seat in advance but simply was unable to do it so i contacted aa and learnt that jal is very strict about seat selection for code share flights irrespective of the aa membership levels this is ridiculous given that both aa and jal are now oneworld alliance members and also given that aa passengers may have to use the aa flight operated by jal if it is the only one aa flight service provided i have no intention of becoming a jal member again i am japanese and used to be a jal member only to solve this issue ie i have more domestic travels in us relative to flying between japan and us japanese airline companies including jal provide excellent care and service to passengers which i like very much but jal and probably all nippon airways can be more flexible about seat selection for code share flights,2
first leg ending in narita japan second let to vancouver bc ive had better food on an airline quantas and american come to mind but im not so sure the service on japan air has its equal in my own experiences which only include british and alitalia to the above for international flights these people never stop looking for someone to attend to they came around at least ten times with drinks four times with food and once with warm towels they are quick to attend to small children and those that just look like they need something if they do or not love this airline i would fly them anytime,5
this plane blew me away as i walked in the door past the first class seats wow then got to my seat i could actually sit and had room for my legs then the service started free meals to be exact hot clothes about every hrs to refresh you drinks non alcohol all u wanted watched excellent movies free as well very comfortable seats the bathroom wow again evan had toothbrushes if you desired wrapped i strongly recommend this airline my best by far experience on any airline,5
very comfortable journey with courteous service variety of inflight entertainment and serving requested special meal on priority,4
after the terrible experience with cathay pacific last monrth i decided to try jal for this trip been a long time and regret not using them again sooner benefit of jl is that flight is that it boards from the t at ord so no need to make the trip over to t plane is a service and catering was excellent very generous measures for all drinks too only small negatives are that the business seat space is a little tight with the jal staggered configuration and the window seats could do with more storage space also took a look at the premium economy cabin seats seemed spacious and comfortable and cabin has much better design for the twin toilet area compared to cathay pacifics noisy and poorly placed single toilet on the plane will definitely be using the jal pe service in the future the fare paid for this trip was surprisingly reasonable and the connection flight jl continued the excellemnt level of service,5
this is the first time we flew japan airlines we we treated so nicely and at time did not know to handle the japanese politeness and courtesy but nice to get pampered the whole experience was flawless from check in to deplaning no hassles and issues outstanding service,5
very good food despite my wanting to do as much japanese as possible the wagyu beef for the western selection was fantastic you can get robes a mattress pad and other things but you have to ask slippers with a shoe horn light blankets and pillow along with the amenity bag are standard bs class very nice the flight attendants sailed down the aisles with smiles but i couldnt get their attention then i pushed the call button by mistake and instantly two attendants were there to help me thats when i learned you have to ask i was politely waiting until they had time to notice me and they were politely allowing my privacy the lounge was good but not great at first we were disappointed until we realized that the real food was upstairs yes there was a sign duh,4
flight cancelled alternative involves hours in tokyo transferring to haneda from narita at my own expense arriving hours later stupid useless airline cant even run a schedule never again,1
ground staff amazing despite the english japanese barriers hey even my japanese does not go far into airline technical language these women were so helpful lot of support to get my bag to me for the next day promised to contact my hotel they did promised to find the bag they did they could see i was tired and stressed so courteous to this soon to be cranky traveler i wasnt happily the desk staff had to fix about five airlines issues about baggage about staff to help many issues they post a whopping big sign that i almost fell over to attract my attention enroute to baggage carousel i asked a random staff member they had a list of passenger issues and directed me to that main desk all had my details while i could make judgmental comparisons of other destinations i wont they do not deserve the space here for the terrific staff trying their best friendly at pm my crankometer rises after pm if i get my bag or not that is not the issue it was the amazing service,5
amazing quality and service bento boxes salmon legroom is incredible consolelike games on entertainment system,5
we are regular patrons of jal flying from vancouver to manila with stop overs in japan and have always been very satisfied with the overall service this year it was a marked disappointment with the downgrade of air craft from the dreamliner to a boeing it was not a pleasure to fly a long transpacific journey on a smaller uncomfortable aircraft which lacks the luxury of size of the planes used in the past that it was a disappointment would be to put it very mildly more so on the return journey they ran out of the western breakfast as requested by my husband unacceptable for a business class service otherwise the service was as usual excellent on one note the new amenity bag by maison kitsune a brand i like is rather useless in its flat sizer,3
service is very very good staffs cleanliness is among the best in the industry no complaints but not as good as emiratesfor overall experience,4
very comfortable flight and check experience staff very kind and polite nothing is to much trouble,5
after buying two round trip tickets notice sent that we would land in haneda and fly out of narita requires a transit visa for filipino wife we were refused visa by japanese embassy in manila jal said was our fault and could not get refund we were going to my sisters burial had to buy wife a rt ticket through hong kong to dallas i flew on original flight noticed my seats confirmed by jal rxqbwu were changed and my wifes seat sold to another passenger jal was great airlines up to this experience will never fly them again after many flights with them before extremely disappointed in jal my wife has usa green card and is a rn working on masters,1
it is difficult to classify the nature of this complaint as it spans jals reservations office as well as airport experience but it revolves around the above flight as well as my connecting flight jl which i missed because of delays in the initial flight once i received notification that my flight was going to be delayed my travel agency and i both tried contacting jal but the numbers just rang out i appreciate that they were in the aftermath of a typhoon in japan but nonetheless it is unacceptable for an airline to just go awol in the circumstances my travel agent advised me to go to the airport early and see if the staff there could help me this i did but the guy on the checkin desk could do nothing for me he suggested that i speak with the jal staff in the american airlines lounge once through security heres the best bit when i got to the lounge i was told that the jal staff had gone home for the day can you imagine my frustration at this the flight from ord to nrt was delayed by many hours but the jal staff didnt even bother to wait around to deal with travelers queries im sure that they would have known that there were going to have many customers in similar circumstances to myself effectively i was left in a situation where i was leaving ord with no idea what arrangements would be put in place for my onward connection all of this amounted to a thoroughly disappointing experience the first time that i was taking this route under a jal ticket although i have flown the route on an aa code share number on previous occasions based on the thoroughly unsatisfactory customer experience with jal i am extremely reluctant to fly jal again particularly as a jal flight at least if i had flown on an aa ticket i could have expected much better customer service as an emerald oneworld member,1
very comfortable flight in economy that hit all of the right customer service buttons except for the long flying time easy checkin boarding could be smoother but minor issue clean freshsmelling amazingly friendly welcome from everyone overhead space was good seat comfortable leg room was fine seating allowed for more aisle room good on a long flight for the walkers takeoff was ontime staff was amazing friendly excellent care always asking if you needed anything if you were comfortable food was very good and served hot even the cutlery was warm and this was economy cleanliness on this full hour flight was incredible bathrooms were cleaned by staff more than once and not with a quick wipe of a paper towel all floors were kept clean with the help of a sticky roller there was nothing messy about the condition of this airplane from start to finish amazing attention to detail and japanese cleaning traditions based on this one experience would recommend jal as a preferred airline to use in asia,5
in october and november i flew on jal on the bangkok to osaka route and again on the tokyo to chicago route and both nonstop flights were great the jal app allowed me to check in early and select my seats on my economy flights the flight attendants were always welcoming friendly and courteous the food was pretty good as well and was plentiful the seating had a little more room and reclined pretty far back allowing for sleep and relaxation i enjoyed my flights and if ever in japan and if the price is right i would fly with jal again,5
to the way back to germany we had another very positive experience with the japanese airlines very polite very helpful very good service enough room for the legs also in the economy class excellent food and beverages no delays no problems every other airline should take example on them,5
we flew back to the uk with boeinger aircraft despite the fact that we couldnt select our seats in advance we were fortunate enough to be given the front seats in the economy class aisle and middle i was very pleased at first that i was given a seat with more leg room than other seats there was an english passenger who was already seated at the window seat when we got to our seats i had to sit in the middle seat as my husband preferred to take the aisle seat and didnt have much complaint up to the time when i realised that the seat i was allocated had some faults later on the passenger next to me was a large lady with an injured leg and she kept moving about within her seat unfortunately everytime she moved tossed or turned the rest of the seat ie my seat directly and my husbands were affected in that her movement made the rest of the seats to be shaken badly and we hardly could get any sleep in this flight journey when i was seated in the middle trying desperately to get some sleep my seat was shaken in connection with this passengers movement it was almost as my seat was constantly pulled from behind when she moved each time to make the matters worse this passenger would like to take a peak at the view outside the window shutter a few times for the duration of the journey when the aircraft was flying into a daytime zone she opened the shutter unexpectedly and it really interrupted my sleep i really couldnt wait to see the end of the journey and get away from this hell honestly i really wished i could have my seat swapped with another had there been any vacant seat available unfortunately it was a full house with a large entourage of japanese school kids also on the same flight the only good thing about this journey was excellent customer service provided by the cabin attendants and food being served next time i fly back from japan to the uk i hope to get a better seat with possibly a better and more polite passenger another annoying incident once the aircraft finally landed at heathrow was that we were told off by a grumpy old english passenger at the premium economy class not to block the aisle when we were already waiting with our luggage for the aircraft door to open this was after the seat belt sign was turned off upon arrival i mean some people would like to get off quickly for transit etc and for that reasons they are waiting standby with luggages they are not blocking the aisle deliberately but simply just want to get out of the aircraft quickly as possible i dont quite understand why he has to complain about us and he himself ended up standing at the aisle waiting to get out whilst we were waiting for the door to open just because he has paid extra for the seat doesnt give him any more automatic privilege and rights than the rest of the passengers in economy class please note my rating on this review just refers to the quality of travel i had with this particular aircraft nothing to complain about the jal service or staff i think they were excellent hosts its just a pity that on this journey i had a terrible journey back from japan to the uk,2
this is the second jal operated flight i took from ukeu to japan we were fortunate to have flown into japan with the latest aircraft carrier boeing from the last review i have done for jal flight they have made more improvement in the choice of the aircraft carrier one of the feature which i was pleased about this carrier was the window shutters no window shutters so especially the passengers who would like to keep the window left open during the whole journey cant do anything about the window was shutterless but it can shut any brightness or glares out coming in from the sun outside the economy seat dimension jal sky wider was another great feature in that the width of the seat and leg room was more than the conventional economy seat and it doesnt seem to affect me that much even if the person in front of me decides to recline the seat in addition i feel some improvement was made to the touch panel screen which has become more touch sensitive so that you wont have to touch the screen with more force which i hate to see especially when your rear passenger is someone who likes to tap abruptly at the screen rather than touch while you are asleep so overall i was very pleased with the aircraft and the quality of the travel from frankfurt to narita,5
our experience with japan airlines throughout the years have been quite positive that we have always taken this airline on our annual visit to the philippines their planes are well maintainedeven the toilets are always kept very clean typical of japanese culture their stewardess are very polite and hospitable,5
one of the best airlines ive been on and would definitely use again food was good and service was excellent the planes were comfortable too very smooth security and check in process at haneda,5
we had till today always bad experience with the long trips not enough place for the legs not enough beverages and drinks and so on but that was not the case by japan airlines a really perfect service very friendly and kind enough place for the legs also at the economy class a good program to offer the drinks and the beverages and tasteful food with a variety of japanese tastes what is more wide selection of films and series to watch free of charge during the flight a very good experience that we will be happy to repeat,5
the lunchtime meal was amazing both regular and the glutenfree option i had they had a program of inviting young chefs to compete to provide meal options best airline meal ive ever had service was augmented by hot towels twice during the flight and good blankets provided at no extra charge i hope never to fly with anyone else between australia and japan,5
the food in the plane is amazing stewardess are all so polite and respectfulhighly recommended,5
everything was efficient and orderly check in fast seemed you had to be at least sapphire one world to get fast track i am biz class alone not enough which is a bit crap especially given naritas propensity for queues lounge ok but a little unexciting given this is jals home base wifi was good capable of streaming video seat was a little narrow but good length in a good hardware for inflight entertainment but the choice was a little limited wifi was chargeable in biz class i didnt try it food was good as was the wine whether you choose jal or sq on this route probably a matter of taste andor pricing if money not an option id go for sq not flown ana or ua recently on this route so cant comment but heard ua have improved,4
i really recommend flying japan airlines when flying to tokyo in economy class the seats are really comfortable you have plenty room of leg space the food is great and you can start your trip enjoying a typical japanese meal they have a nice entertainment system with nice movies to watch in case you cant fall sleep the flight attendants are really nice and helpful,5
the economy seats are wider than your average economy seats with more leg room each seat had usb input for charging your device a provided tv and controller which was loaded with moviesshows music simple games and able to view your flight itinerary for my flight international and about hours of travel blanket and pillow were provided for each seat toothbrushtoothpaste provided in the washroom dinner breakfast snack time but can request for more free beverages including liquor in flight staff was very friendly and helpful when i had issues spoke both japanese and english loading and unloading was quite efficient was a great overall experience and would recommend others to use this airline for travelling international,5
and hours flight from tokyo to vancouver was pleasant for a long flight plane arrive on time and left on time and we even got in vancouver about minutes ahead of time flight attendant was efficient and polite and decent amount of leg room entertainment center in plane was typical and had lots of movies to keep you entertained best long flight i had for over hour plane trip,5
i am giving stars to the cabin crew went jal on return trip as well it was a seat was well padded and enough room but major issue is it doesnt lie flat at its flatest i tended to slip towards my feet so had to keep readjusting myself i decided to not sleep and just watch a movie the food is good the toilets clean crew were somewhat late serving the meal but i wasnt that hungry anyway the crew were polite helpful gracious very attentive always smiling true the overhead pa announcements can be hard to understand with the accent but they were willing to repeat and explain to you personally if you didnt understand or have a question overall a pleasant flight,5
absolutely nothing to complain about everything was great with this airline and would most certainly fly with jal again,5
great service from crew but an old plane uncomfortable bed in business and so so food our return flight from jfk to cgk was similar via narita problem was one of my suitcase appeared on the arrival carousel with a wheel assembly missing staff was oblivious and couldnt have cared and we left airport wouldnt fly jal again after this experience and cost,2
first time fly jal and it was disappointed cabin service was ok im sorry i just have a very hard time to understand what the cabin crew said food was below medico er for japanese cuisine on a japanese airline how can it be bad right not it was not good at all the entree cooked fish was hard like rock the crew member doesnt seem to communicate to each other difference member come to ask us the same thing like breakfast we ordered before one will tell us the item we ordered was out and we told them we ordered ahead of time so now is not out since we have more jal flight to catch i try to call the customer service number guess what it charge per mins if you use your cell to call it will charge you per sec i am not sure but it less than a mins seriously which airline will charge for customer service so no more japan airline,1
we flew from bangkok to san francisco with change of jet in tokyo the service on both legs was terrific we found the service better than first class on virgin and british airways which are quite good we have traveled on other air singapore cathay pacific china eastern airlines and thai airways japan airlines is handsdown the best the food was quite good we try to fly business or first class on long flights but decided to fly economy this time we were suprised i would fly japan airlines anytime there were a number of flight attendants they were so sweet and kind,5
japan airlines has never failed us in giving their best to make sure our comfort and safety the cabin is always super clean plenty of leg room and superb service from the crews flight is always on time and on board entertainment is awesomehighly recommended,5
were suppose to be on ba but got moved to japanese airlines and so glad we did things like seat room cleanliness food were average and what you would expect from a mid priced airline on a economy seat entertainment was at the same level as ba but not as good as virgin the staff were amazing they were polite and smiled when they served you a rare thing with cabin crew these days they were efficient remembered the children meals we had ordered again an issue we have had again and again with virgin and ba with very unhelpfulrude staff from both the staff couldnt do enough for you and found that completely refreshing,5
a big thank you to the jal staff at frankfurt for returning my bag to manchester short connection and no way of checking all the way through resulted in me leaving my bag in frankfurt the staff at frankfurt made the effort to have it transported to me at manchester airport at no extra cost many thanks james,5
nice crew and friendly team will seat again when came japan good choose in time to departure and arrival on time too,5
i booked my jal flight with american theres a jal kiosk at ohare in the newly remodeled admirals club flagship lounge which if you are flying business class you get access to whether you are flying american or jal the service at the jal kiosk is impeccable and i dare say better than what youd experience at the admirals club the flight itself is pretty standard for business class i prefer aa long haulstheres just a little more freedom to wander jal customers seem very orderly by contrast the cabins feel a little dated too though the seats lay completely flat and the entertainment options are good and the food in business was actually much better than what i experience on aa the service on board was excellent as expected friendly but slightly formal jal terminal and sakura lounge at narita were excellent with good shopping and dining,5
i requested for vegetarian meal during my flight but the request was missed out the flight attendant just said that they didnt receive any request on their end and left it as that there were totally no service recovery done like offer some cakes or vegetarian sandwiches etc i was left hungry till later when they took out some cakes and muffins for the passengers during snack time why wasnt this offered to me earlier very disappointing service its my first and last flight with jal,1
flew from helsinki to narita airporttokyo very comfortable flight more leg room in economy than ba as they were who i booked with good food i had the vegetarian option very attentive sevice i would definatley fly with them again as a preferred choice of airline to japan,5
on the my wife and i went from melbourne australia to tokoyo japan on a flight at am the staff were friendly the seating was comfortable and food was good we were greeted with a smile when boarding and on arrival in japan this was my first flight with this airline i would definitely recommend this airline and hope to fly again with the airline in the future,4
this is a review of their review and survey i wrote a negative review of their check in service at itm i responded to their survey to criticize their idiotic check in staff at itm and requested a response i also sent a criticism to their website requesting a response three out of three no acknowledgement or response of any kind positive negative or neutral is japan airlines being overly sensitive to anything negative said to them all us airlines are far better at responding to a complaint whether or not they do anything begs another discussion but at least they all respond invariably most airlines the problem is the understaffed airport services like check in transfer baggage drop off ticketing etc most flights once they take off are usually fine i know they can do only so much in the air i also understand they can only do so much on the ground when the place usually look line lines at disneyland now disneyland does a much better job of controlling lines and the masses jal may want to consult disney on how to operate a line people waiting to be checked in ticketed baggage drop etc jal is the worst in response of all airlines ive encountered,1
i need to remind my self to avoid jal if flying from jakarta the office people was super unhelpful i booked my ticket through a online rd party without any cancelation policy it was business class ticket and i spend k yen so its not the cheapest but it was last minute ticket and i need to have a change one day earlier due to some urgent work they did not allowed me to they were so strict and unhelpful just reply no no no and no non refundable as well so take it with the japanese super calculative and unhelpful i think just stick to garuda at least they,1
i received unprofessional airport handling from japan airlines in jakarta for my flight departure from jakartatokyonew york on october th on october th am via email i received notice of web checkin result with seat no all the way to new york on october th am via email i received notice of flight cancellation for jal tokyo to new york follow with on october th am via email i received notice of flight cancellation for jal jakarta to tokyo due to typhoon hagibis we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience was mentioned that i can contact local japan airlines in jakarta and i did it and waiting for almost minutes without never able to reach the reservation staff the other no was an answering and open only for week day office hour on october th as i received no information at all about my flight schedule so i came to the airport am japan airlines check in counter open and assisted by japan airlines staff use jal uniform who immediately told me that this is a force majeure and he cant do anything about it i told him i open my reservation online and i saw japan airlines already rebooked my flight october th ke seoul incheoon but he said its a computer generated itinerary and nothing he cant do about it while we talked i found out via flight radar that jal on that morning fly to tokyo i noticed that every single japanese nationalities assisted by japan airlines staff japanese and wear jal uniform assisted quietly to immigration i also received an email from japan airlines that flight jl tokyo to new york back to operation as per schedule im a frequent traveller so i asked the counter if he can transfer me to qatar airways both jal and qatar member of one world first he try to confuse me and he said he will transfer me via china airlines malaysian airlines and cathay pacific after i pushed him finally he was able to book my flight to new york qr october eta the bad news i cant change my return flight as i arrived one day late in new york i have to wait at the airport for almost hours without any hotel provided by japan airlines before leaving jakarta i know typhoon hagibis typhoon no will stop everything but japan every year have more than typhoon and i believe a reputable airlines like japan airlines sure have a protocol to assist their customers when typhoon or earthquake occur i wrote this review to remind everyone that you may experience the same situation in future on october th im the lucky one as finally i can fly with qatar airways although i have to pay my own hotel in jakarta and i lost one night accommodation in new york i noticed a some passengers left behind in confusion as no one take care their journey i gave poor rating for my flight jakarta to new york,2
no departure delay the cabin is clean wide sheet spacing good service japanese quority amenity is good,5
i and my family are always using jal for the international flights due to my home is in bangkok and my daughters study in us i always use jal because of good service and always ontime my daughters are sitting in economy class in which also get the good services and good food as well i recommend jal to anyone that would like the great pleasure international flight,5
we would like to say thank you so much to hori the wonderful and super helpful supervisor for japan airlines at haneda airport for changing our flight so easily yesterday and for taking away all the stress we were in a bit of a stress as we presented ourselves to the wrong tokyo airport and we had no chance to catch our flight back to france we had a great flight back to paris food on board was very good,5
aside from the flight being full and the seats my colleague and i received were not so great everything else from food to comfort to the larger entertainment screen was of a good quality,4
this was such unbelievable service i cant stop raving about how much i loved it champagne was served to me from a magnum of crystal to start dinner you had your chose of anything your heart desires i t was incredible lobster filet mignon done right not over cooked my favorite was the truffled egg sandwich again amazing comfy pajamas and the amenity bad had everything one could imagine in there love this airline the staff were amazing,5
national flag airline company the aircraft was b as my favorite one i love to board to asian airline companies very very good to service hospitality meals and beverage etc i was very surprised to the toilet in this plane they have bidet toilets in the plane also the space was super clean super comfortable flight to me,5
regular domestic flight journey off to ngs as it was only a minutes flight they will only serve drinks theres beef broth also its weird but tasty quick service on time landing,4
flight departed on time from tsa bound for hnd what made it exceptional from all other major airliness economy was the food on board i seldom clear all dishes but jal had such a high standard of catering service that deserves a wide mention flight landed on time and i have a connecting to ngs fa stood in front of gate with my name on it and gave me a ticket for the train service from the intl terminal to the domestic one yet i could not figure out how to use it anyway i managed to squeeze past the security and immigration within minutes and managed to get my bags and drop within minutes for my next flight see even with a connecting of only minutes you will still be able to make it on time,5
i fly almost every week for work sadly usually in economy jal is far and away the best airline i fly in it is comfortable and clean with decent food but the main thing is that the airline gives the full impression of really wanting you on the plane thats not always true of usa carriers to give a small example i left my pencil case in the lounge at narita airport i told the flight attendant and soon a pencil case was being run the length of the airport and delivered on to the flight just before takeoff it was only a pencil case but jal treated with care i hear many stories like this excellent airline always my first choice,5
as i said the seat etc is good the drinks offering is good the service was good but the food was just very boring and disappointing i pre ordered an ovo lacto meal and it was so boring like on many airlines to be fair my amuse bouche was salad and some peper sticks my starter was exactly the same just a bigger plate followed by some boring pasta with sauce and this twice on the long flight so twice pasta there is so much amazing japanese food which could be made vegetarian but jal chooses to serve salad and pasta was really not impressed for the flight you get the usual amenities kit and some slippers but no pj you can have a cardigan if you ask for it selection of movies was also not great,2
i have been traveling a lot on singapore airlines and this was the few instances that i am flying on another airline the one main comment that stands out is the seat spaciousness compared to sq feels roomier and cushioning was better other than that the food and service were about the same although i am high on sq loyalty tiered program my future choice for flights to japan would be now based price delta as loyalty has a price limit,4
travelled up from sydney to tokyo on their jl flight on board boeing dreamliner far from any dreams on this flight seat space was sparse for a business class fare compared with other airlines there entertainment system is the worst experienced in either economy or business ever poor selection for non japanese speaking people so glad this was a short flight they ran out of food options crew made excuses every time a food option was not available they should offer smaller selection so have more dishes to go round coffee was warm at best i tried multiple times to get a good cup so gave up happy when plane landed could get off,3
my wife and i flew japan air to tokyo from san fransisco what an amazing comfortable flight im ish had more room then first class on a domestic flight was fed amazing food and drinks for free drinks being the adult kind and was treated as a first class person all the way to the hot towels and beverage selection amazing crew and very happy to help,5
the below is a letter i sent to jal by email but five day later no response dear sirmadam it was most disappointing to end my great trip to japan with having to deal with a lying disrespectful jal person when trying to check in along with being fleeced for a considerable amount of money i shouldnt have had to pay while i missed my inward flight to japan through no fault at all on jal part due to my flight to manila being cancelled and me having to get a later flight it was most distressing to find when going to get the return flight that this had been cancelled this was despite the jal personnel at t in manila telling me this wouldnt be a problem when i didnt make the time to check in there i flew with another airline to japan later that day as jal didnt have any more flights i could get on that day i would like someone to please explain the following and are hopeful for honest answers which is something i certainly did not get last night at the narita airport why was my ticket cancelled without informing me after i had been told that it would be ok to use by jal staff in manila why did the young gentleman checking me in tell me that this is a world wide rule with all airlines that if you dont use the inward leg the return is cancelled i know this is not true as ive experienced the same with china air and air new zealand cebu pacific and pal for various reasons and never had an issue with the return leg why does jal have this rule where tickets are cancelled without contacting the customer a very poor rule that you need to reconsider why when i first started to try and check in and was told that my ticket was cancelled and that it was impossible to check me in and despite that seats were available on the flight this shouldnt have been seen as impossible there is very little that is impossible this should have been very simple to sort on being told i would have to pay for a new ticket which i said i would that the plane was suddenly full and the only seat left was a business class seat i said that would have to do as i had to be in manila today as i have a meeting with people flying in from taiwan thailand malaysia i was told the price for the ticket was y while this seemed expensive even for a business seat i said yes i would do that as i had to get to manila that night i very much got the impression the young man didnt think i would accept this and didnt want me to fly that night why after being told that there was only one seat left did the young gent ask me if i wanted a window or aisle seat i challenged him on this if he was lying when he told me there was only one business class seat left he said that some passengers had not turned up for the flight why after being told that i had to buy the only business class seat left on the plane did i get a economy seat for the y again i asked why i had a economy seat when he told me the price was for the only business class seat available his response was that he hadnt told me that was for a business class seat another blatant lie why once the plane took off was i able to walk around the plane and spot empty seats after being lied to that the plane was full the empty seats were as follows row e row ae row eg row k row ef row d row ef row a row egk row egk row f row eg what a disappointment it was dealing with a dishonest and disrespectful person that works for you after such a great trip to japan where i found everything to be so good and the people so polite honest respectful and disciplined this was the first person i met on the trip who is a disgrace to the good people of the japanese nation i will not let me put this off japan as i plan to have another holiday in winter and maybe catch some of the olympics i will however be flying with another airline this person has lost me as a customer for good and i will pass onto all my contacts how poor jal treat their customers im hoping someone at jal can answer my questions above kind regards michael j mcgrory,1
i hadnt flown with jal for some years and was bowled over by how good the experience was impeccable service from the cabin crew who were courteous charming and went out of their way to be helpful everything else was good but it was the crew that made the extra difference food was excellent with a choice of japanese or western menu and good wine and beverage choices again including some japanese options sake umeshu seat was roomy and comfortable with support to keep your legs up its perfect for shortmedium haul and although the lieflat bed option isnt great a bit short and not completely flat it seems this isnt the seat jal uses for long haul flights any more decent entertainment selection with easy to use touch screen system and for once the headphone jack is clearly marked and easy to find so often not the case the only downside is that jal doesnt seem to fly from hong kong to haneda a much better airport with much better access than narita nonetheless jal will be my preferred option for tokyo from now on,5
great service and efficiency meal was good friendly flight attendants entertainment below average on time flewi september,5
i took the jal ovenight flight from osaka kansai airport to bangkok the flight is the last departure for jal for the night at am when i first arrived at the sakura lounge at kansai around pm it was very busy as jal shares the lounge with a number of other airlines including emirates and there were a number of jumbo international flights around pm by pm though the lounge was almost empty as most of the other flights for jal and the other airlines were boarding or had departed already the sakura lounge has a good selection of food in a buffet several hot vegetable dishes sandwiches salads halal beef hamburger pieces and of course jals trademark beef curry with rice after i had eaten i noticed staff then brought out different items for the buffet including a japanese noodle offering and fried pork and fried lotus root on skewers there was plenty of food on offer for a dinner preflight service as always with jal is extremely good food is replenished promptly and as soon as a guest finishes staff rush over to clean the table for the next guest the late night flight boarded and pushbacked on schedule flight time was hours minutes jal uses a b with the shell flat neo seat in a xx configuration in business class for this flight the shell flat neo is an angle flat seat and the window seat passenger has to step over the aisle passenger to access the aisle however as i had seat a in the first row it was easy to step over the aisle seat passenger as there is no console from another seat in front blocking me while the seat is only angle flat i find it quite comfortable to sleep in as it seems to have greater width at the shoulder and chest level than jals fully flat sky suite i ii and iii product on boarding there was a meal service selection card at each seat for the passenger to select whether to be woken for breakfast or not i chose to be woken for breakfast notwithstanding the short sleep time on the flight as jal has excellent food i was not disappointed as the japanese set breakfast that i was served was both beautiful to look at and filled with a wide variety of great flavours from a bento box of a selection of several starters and a hot main of fish and vegetables due to the late night departure time very quickly after takeoff the captain announced it was fine to recline ones seat and most passengers quickly settled in to sleep about an hour and minutes before landing i was woken for breakfast service service was exceptional with the purser for the flight making a point of coming by to chat with each passenger once they awoke and making sure to provide reminders about the premium lane fast track through immigration setup that is provided for business class passengers arriving in bangkok she also went through the cabin prior to landing to individually thank each business class passenger for flying with jal the flight landed about minutes early at am there is quite a long walk from the gate to immigration but so early in the morning it was not busy at the airport or immigration first bags arrived at the luggage carousel around am shortly after i got there one benefit of the early morning arrival is the lack of traffic on the roads i was at my hotel in the sukhumvit area in less than minutes as opposed to the one hour plus travel time that is the norm,5
i took a connecting flight from tokyo narita to osaka itami airport this is a very short flight of only about an hour and jal put too nice a product on this short haul flight with a b equipped with sky suite fully flatbed seats in j class domestic business class in a xx configuration with such a short flight time there was really not much chance to take advantage of the fully flatbed feature but i did appreciate the privacy of the seat with semienclosed seats and staggered set up so my window seat had direct aisle access without having to step over the passenger next to me there was a large video screen for my seat but on this short flight the entertainment programs were disabled so the screen only showed flight information there was a quick paper cup drink service for the short flight our pushback was about minutes late and there was about a half hour wait for takeoff due to heavy traffic at narita airport in the early evening slot as a result the flight arrived about minutes late first bags arrived at the luggage carousel about minutes after landing i was headed for kobe and luckily the airport limousine bus to sannomiya station in kobe is quite frequent and i was on the bus enroute to sannomiya about a half hour after landing jal operates a number of different planes and configurations for these domestic short haul flights often the flight will be with a b or b with just standard seats often configured xx so this flight with the much more luxurious sky suite was a pleasant surprise,5
the customer service was exceptional first time flying with them and would do it again i am feet so i have a out of always will fight for more leg room hence it not being,4
wow the plane crew bow before getting on the plane the crew was very polite and the trip very smooth would fly again with jal,5
first time i flew to japan i am foot inches tall and we were seated in the back of the plane in coach i had plenty of room comfortable flight food was good for no extra cost service was great and attendants were always friendly and available when we needed something no bathrooms at rear which was good because no constant traffic there was even an area behind us to stand and stretch also suitcase checkin and one carryon per person all in all it was a good experience and we will fly with them again,5
the premium economy cabin provides lots of legroom and seats are wide i was seated in k which has extra space given its location directly behind business class the crew on jal are excellent always have a smile and very pleasant the cabin and toilets were very clean and food was plentiful and of a good standard overall i would highly recommend jal and will look forward to flying with them again in the near future,5
the overall flight is fine but i can say its not better than some other airlines i got that business ticket from sfo to hnd with the air miles redeem i never take jal and heard a lot about the japanese airlines have great services so i have a high expectation for that flight the sakura lounge in sfo its only opens between pm its especially only open for services for the jal passengers its quite small the space between seats are bit narrow its ok the foods they served are limited the sushi is cold and the rice is hard the fried chicken nugget do not taste good compared with the united club lounge in hong kong its much better on the flight the plane model is i choose a window seat i dont like the design of that seat it feel narrow not much space to extra storage i feel like i am sitting on a economy seat just it have space to stretch my leg and able to convert into a flat bed the good is it has a very large screen but its not a touch screen need to use a wired remote control the entertainment is ok have the latest hollywood movies but most of them i already watched before also you can use the remote control to order the side foods anytime you like the service of course the flight attendants did are excellent jobs for the services i have no complaints the foods i love japanese foods so i choose the japanese menu i looked at the pictures of the foods they served its very attractive and seems very delicious yes the foods they served exactly like the pictures i seen before but i am disappointed to the taste its quite mild and not much flavored the meat are over cooked so i want to say i didnt enjoy the foods it served after the main dinnermeal if you want some snacks or side meals you need to order through the remote control or you can have the flight attendant order for you its ok overall its good and acceptable with that flight i am glad that ticket is free i want to say if i have to pay i prefer some other airlines such as cathy pacific china airlines or singapore airlines,3
ok i understand and accept that my flight home to sydney from narita was cancelled due to a severe typhoon however whats not acceptable or explainable is the total lack of contact by emailphone or text from jal to firstly advise of the cancellation or to advise of arrangements they would make to put me on an alternative flight all phone numbers on their website rang out without an answer so my last resort is lining up in hour long queue outside of their tokyo office is this a first world airline or not i think not and would be very disinclined to fly with them again,1
got cheap tickets through a website and have to say fantastic service legroom food and to have the crew come around and personally thank each passenger for flying with them is a real change i would definatly fly with this airline again,5
absolutely fuming with japan airlines and would never recommend them to anyone booked through them as i thought they were a reputable airlines how drastically this perception has changed came to japan for the rugby world cup and everything seemed sweet unbeknownst to everyone a typhoon hit japan and we knew things would be a little chaotic no fault of ja obs so we called ja to consult as to what to do with our trip as our flight was to take off the day after the typhoon hit we were told that the flight would likely go ahead and that if we were not there for checkin we would not be given a new flight as the chaos continued the only way to the airport was through a bus the day before so we stupidly took this bus got to the airport and thought o well at least we will make our flights where things get troublesome is that not long after arriving to the airport we hear that the last bus to tokyo city is leaving but hey we check again and our flights are still scheduled so we decide to stay half hour after the last bus had left we get and email our flights are canceled because of the connection issues between tokyo and the airport so now we are stranded in the airport and no way to leave all because we were told that had we not been there for check in we would have to buy another flight where things get even worse ive been trying for the last hours to get though to anyone from japan airlines to work our when our next flights will be but hey all phone lines are not able to be reached and noone from ja is here so instead of staying in a nice hotel were stranded in an airport with no knowledge of when we can leave and no idea when our next flight is thanks ja youre definetly not recommended completely understand this must be a chaotic time for you but wtf would you cancel your flights the momemmnts after the last chance for anyone to leave the airport theres still hope we may be able to get home without too much more unneeded stress but hey im not holding my breathe,1
staff were friendly helpful during check in there were some baby toddlers on the flight but the crew were very helpful in helping parents to deal with children which make the long flight tolerable thanks to their hard work,5
this was a short flight from nagasaki to haneda and went well checkin was flawless and board the same the aircraft was spotless and the staff smiling and courteousbaggage arrived promptly as did the flight on time,4
i cant believe that i did not know this before but jal has more space in economy class compared to other planes in certain newer models they have removed one seat per row ensuring wider seats on a ten hour trip from sydney to narita tokyo this really made a difference as you did not feel so hemmed in the seat in front was also a little further away which just made the whole experience more pleasant staff were extremely polite and the food beautifully presented for the return flight i had managed to get an economy plus ticket for the same price as my outgoing economy seat its definitely worth looking at booking directly through their website when i consider that i could have been stuck in a cramped jetstar flight for the same price with no food or entertainment included i feel so happy that i came across japan airlines will definitely fly with them again to japan,5
the st class lounge is bigger than the one in haneda airport and has better food this flight is similar to the one i took last year from haneda to new york cabinet crew and service are very good the only difference is the food on board this flight from narita has international cuisine besides the japanese cuisine the last year flight from haneda do not have international cuisine the excellent services from the crew are similar,5
prior to my flight on jal from vancouver to narita i opted to use the cathay pacific lounge instead of the plaza premium lounge that jal uses as the cx lounge is much nicer is less crowded and has better food the lounge had lots of seating and was never very full during the hour or so that i was there cx has the noodle bar offering dim sum wonton noodle soup and dan dan noodle made to order but they also always have a western offering too it was chicken risotto today so i gave it a try quite good tasting cx also has a cold buffet section with sandwiches salads and desserts my jal flight from vancouver to narita was operated with a b instead of the dreamliner b that jal has been using the last few years whereas the dreamliner was equipped with angle flatbed shell flat neo seats in a xx configuration the b is much better equipped with the sky suite ii fully horizontal flatbed seat in a xx configuration i selected the window seat in row as the window seats alternate by having a shelf next to you on the aisle side or next to you on the window side and k is nicely situated right next to the window with a shelf between the seat and the aisle for more privacy and less disturbance from aisle traffic row by comparison would have the shelf on the window side putting distance between you and the window view there were only rows of seats in business class for a total of seats with empty seats on this flight boarding and pushback was on time expertly and efficiently handled by jal staff as usual flight time as reported by the captain was relatively long at hours min due to strong headwinds we ended up landing at pm about minutes late as a result once in flight i noticed the engine noise in the cabin was considerably louder than on the dreamliner the air was also noticeably drier since the part carboncomposite dreamliner is able to be pressurized to a lower altitude with more moisture in the air than the all metal b the toilets were also smaller and less nice than on the dreamliner just regular old style toilets instead of the japanese toilet spray equipped ones on the dreamliner on the plus side the sky suite ii seats with their fully horizontal flat sleep position was much more comfortable for sleeping than the dreamliner shell flat neo seats though when fully reclined the bed position was quite narrow at the shoulder position unlike the original sky suite seats the side armrestspartitions on the sky suite ii seat do not lower down when the seat is reclined to bed position so no extra width is provided in the bed position the sky suite ii seat does have lots of little storage spaces a good size one located on the shelf next to the seat and a small cubbyhole under the video screen for a phone or small tablet there is also a cubbyhole close to floor level for shoes meal service on this pm departure afternoon flight was dinner after takeoff followed by a breakfastsnack about hours before landing food as always on jal is delicious and beautiful to look at i selected the japanese meal for both meals the hot entree at dinner was salmon and pork belly with the pork belly particularly distinguishing itself in taste prior to the entree a bento box style starter selection is served with different selections dessert was coconut pudding with peach sauce as always i finished with coffee as jal serves a special coffee in business class only in flight and it is delicious for the second meal prior to arrival the japanese selection was grilled rockfish with rice service as always on jal is gracious and attentive when i mentioned i always have the special coffee served on board the flight attendant kindly offered a pack of the coffee brewpack for me to take home to enjoy the entertainment system had a good selection of recent hollywood movie as well as a number of japanese and asian movies i am not a big fan of narita airport as it is always too busy after landing i made my way to passport control for my connecting flight and was lucky to be a few steps quicker as the line became much longer a couple of minutes after i joined it fortunately the line moved quite efficiently so it was about a minute wait to get through immigration my luggage was already on the carousel by the time i reached baggage claim and a few minutes later i was through customs and into the arrivals hall at about pm a bit more than half an hour after landing,5
it has been a while since i had flown domestically with jal and this flight did not disappoint checkin was seamless and courteous and boarding the same the flight left and arrived on time and baggage came out reasonably fast overall a goof flight in an older boring,3
being in japan for the rwc we arrived late into osaka and had an early connecting flight to sapporo as a number of others did as well our plan was to get a meal in the loungethere was pretty much nothing there tea coffee and beerwe had one of them no food ok wait for the flightagain the staff were friendly and everything was effiicientbut no food tea or coffee etc if you wanted it,3
a top notch airline good food and free drinks flight crew was excellent we used to think korean air was the best for flights in that direction not any more,5
雖然空間不算大座椅也不算好睡但是餐食實在是太好吃了即使是咖啡都很用心雖然冰淇淋非常普通甚至太甜但仍不減整體餐食設計的優秀 the seat is not really comfortable for sleep and the size isnt spacious i still appreciate the wonderful meals and the considerate staff offered me a nice flight experience i dont like the ice cream too sweet and not tasty,5
the seat pitch is larger than other airlines and the leg room was great for a hour flight we were provided with neck pillows and blankets and i was able to get very comfy the crew were friendly and the food was really nice,5
we upgrade to premium economy by paying approximately us and it was well worth it great service comfortable seats and good food,5
theyll wake you gently with a nice hot towel offer a choice of beers and the food even comes with instructions and write up on the chef would be happy to receive such service and food at a restaurant much less miles high plenty of movies and games to play so the only drawback is lack of sleep upon arrival keep up the good work jal,5
this is one of my most favorite airlines another being korean air traveling economy is like the old days you can actually sit in the seat and not get a stomach ache from scrunching your knees to your ears like other airlines make you do the bathrooms are spacious complete with those great japanese toilets the staff is so wonderful gracious japanese hospitality so why did i give it this rating going from tokyo to delhi the dining options were fish and beef going to india and serving beef as an option is culturally clueless id say and this is the second time thats happened on this leg weird that from honolulu the options were chicken and shrimp now that would be a leg to have beef jal if youre looking at this review please respond im so curious to hear why this is the case thanks,4
when i said comfort i meant comfort its a very large plain like a could possible be the air turbulence was next to none throughout that hour the flight attendant was wonderful service is great the food very nice so many different choice on the menue just to name a few beef stew chicken curry with rice and even a special birthday celebration for a passenger vegetable all king of drinkswhen the pilot announce we about to land i said wow,5
we traveled with jal global card so could enjoy smooth procedure lounge at narita was renewed wth wider space and what most supried us was that the airplanes were equipped with washlet,4
we flew jal business class from sydney to tokyo for a week at the rugby world cup we had use of the qantas lounge in sydney and jal lounges choice of two at narita both flights were on time the all female cabin crew were very welcoming and attentive and all spoke english the seating is and we had the middle two both ways the seats are very comfortable lie flat of course and with all the usual facilities the entertainment package is comprehensive with a good choice of new movies the absolute stand out is the food there is a choice of japanese or western cuisine go japanese it is beautifully presented and exquisitely tasty youd struggle to get a better meal in a quality restaurant my partner had the western menu on the return flight and it was similarly delicious as an interesting aside the flight crew have taken taken taciturn to a new level on the flight out there was a curt crew seats for landing on the return not a peep not a problem for me im glad theyre concentrating on flying the plane if you ever have the option of flying jal take it i have flown business class with almost every airline and this is one of the very best,5
conclusion instead of giving people trying to make an international check in a run around open more desks jal has numerous agents running around giving you advise their way of telling you what to do and their response when refused which is rather amusingly obvious that a refusal is not what they want when they are trying to tell you what to do in a suggestive manner only one agent here that handles international flight so go wait for the four desks to open minutes later we were already second in lne so why go where we have to wait more minutes we had plans to have lunch at itami so heck with baby sitting the luggage for minutes longer plus more waiting what are all those agents with jal lapel pins doing open the damn desk at instead suggest to people standing at the back of the line to go elsewhere and wait some more the reaction of the agent when i refused to go was surprisingly unpleaseant when done full of smiles it was suggested several times that it would be quicker to wait until than to keep waiting where we were by the time the suggestions stopped we were served and checked in at least an half an hour prior to the other check in desks opening several families and unfortunate souls who tood the advise where all gathered waiting in line for a line that didnt open for another thirty minutes if they didnt like where i was waiting just say so and tell me to move then i may have moved it was a suggestion so i politely declined the first couple of times but when it is done for the third fourth or fifth time most people get irritated i am one of most people what i concluded was the airport manager for jal at itami must be an idiot just so you know the business class to japan on jal fine business class nrt to pus fine economy to nrt economy to nrtitm fine gate and check in and transfer agents were fine thus my conclusion of the idiot running the itm ground agents,1
the japan airlines flight from singapore to miami both to and from i was asked to provide some proof that i am allowed to be in singapore even though as a citizen of another asean country we are allowed to travel among the member nations visa free any other airline would not have even asked for me to show some card or id that i am living or working in singapore i have lived in singapore for over ten years ive travelled all over the world for many years the experience with jal was a first for me it was a very offending experience i will never take japan airlines ever again if you are not white or japanese dont take this airline as they will racially profile you,1
i am very disappointed with jal it has ruined my first japan tripexperience we were set to depart am th september and because we heard about the typhoon that hit on th and ended on the th morning on the very day of departure we even rang at pm to make sure our flight had not been cancelledrescheduled and we got the all ok and happily we prepared and booked our transport to the airport for pm just as we were about to leave for the airport we got an email saying it has been cancelled due rotation caused by typhoon in the morning bear in mind typhoon has left japan by then we werent given any further instruction on the email and the toll free reservation number put us on hold for an hour we need to know when our rescheduled flight will be postponed til so we were forced to go to the airport adults babies and children and you can imagine the anxiety and confusion at that time when we reached we were greeted with a bottle of water and a sandwich we were then told to get a number and waited in line at pm at just about am we were finally at the front of the queue and was told we didnt have much choice anymore and the the next flight would be on philippines airlines at am transiting in manila for hours we asked if we could get a hotel just to freshen up while we wait for bear in mind we booked jal cause we hate transit flights to be then put in this situation is appalling philippines airline counter to be open at am airport departure gate to be open at am but we were declined that we were forced to wait with crying babies no sleep on the floor in tullamarine airport subsequently we went to manilla on a packed plane jal forgot to get us a bassinet for my baby and we are forced in a role of adults with no room for baby my baby had not slept since pm the night before that was so horrible for the hours flight you would think a mainstream airline would usually have bassinet for under months olds but jal forgot to book me that on the replacement flight the following is not directly due to jals fault more phillipines airlinesmanila airports incompetence but jal put us through this hell when we reached manila and told them at immigration that we were transiting to narita they assumed not sure why and what with phillipines airlines and took us straight to the transfer desk which is outside the immigration hall we even asked if we can collect our luggage first but was told not to worry at that stage when we got to the transfer desk they were shocked to find out our transfer was actually with jal the manila tokyo leg and they panicked after realising their mistake as by then we were outside restricted areas without of bags they also refused our reentry to collect our bags and after hour waitingwatching them panicking there they finally offered to get our bags for us but came back minutes saying they couldnt find our bags we were forced to rush to another terminal waited another minutes for bus without our bags and board the plane to narita we got there late the next day and lost days day transitingstuck in airports and day having to buy clothes as we had nothing we missed our tour to gotemba and mount fuji as a result of this we were not offered any apologies whatsoever and when we flew back on rd we asked nicely if we could get an upgrade or at least an apology at least if no compensation we were only given a lame sakura lounge entry which we only had less than minutes to spend in there i am very disappointed with how japan airlines treated us and how this has ruined our much anticipated trip that we booked months ahead and has caused us all the stress and dramas it was hardly a holiday thanks to you,1
i query whether it is worth paying extra to go business with jal we had to search for the check in which doesnt even mention business there is no business lounge all we got on the flight was a drink and the seating doesnt seem much better than economy seating i was surprised at the lack of food as this was a lunch time flight and the overall time in the plane was close to hours in addition there was no inflight entertainment i guess that i sound like a whinger but this was the first business class flight i have been on which felt like economy on a budget airline but with better seats,3
the only thing i liked about this flight was very attentive and caring flight attendant the hardwares are aged so much and did not feel i was in first class cabin also food are very mediocre and tasteless the only dish i enjoyed was ice cream and some desserts i would not fly again with jal s first cabin its not worth it for my experience,3
japan airlines which i will refer to as jal is an amazing way to enter japan from anywhere on the globe with their very comfortable aircraft amazing service on my flight check in was very fast and efficient with no line as there were many counters open for passengers a diagram was shown of the boeing showing how half the cabin was for business passengers surprisingly and only cabin was for economy passengers the boarding of jals aircraft is very fast and efficient and was completed within a few minutes however despite the gate in sydney being located right next to the food court there is no seating directly at the gate as it is shared slightly further away with other gates and at the time the morning flight departs it can be hard to find seats during boarding economy business class were boarded at the same time and after the express queue for business class ended economy passengers were invited to use that queue too right after boarding the very friendly cabin crew accounted for any dietary conditions putting identification stickers on each seat which required them so the process would be smooth when the meals were to be served from this moment the experience felt very strongly japanese with the cabin crew taking a bow in the initial welcome the on board bathrooms also were extremely spacious has marble flooring had toilet seat cleansing functions straight from japan the toilets are some of the cleanest most modern toilets i have ever seen on a plane and the crew were constantly cleaning them unfortunately apart from at meal times beverage services were very sparse and when they did exist only one type of beverage was available this meant that you were often very thirsty and unless you wanted the particular drink being served you would have to wait until the meal service there were meal services on this hour flight one after takeoff and one before landing due to the plane being a boeing the amount of legroom was massive also according to a brochure in the seat back pocket it has been rated the best economy airline seat for years in a row however the recline on the seat was a bit less than expected and i couldnt fall asleep however lots of other passengers could jal was an amazing airline experience which id never expected and i definitely would fly with them in the future,5
although it was a very long flight the staff made it very enjoyable always asking if i neeed anything else the food was good and served at good times very nice trip,5
to be honest i really didnt expect too much from jal the plane wasnt new or anything like that but the devil was in the details on our flight to tokyo my girlfriend pointed out that the tint on the windows was adjustable via a small button control system next to the window there was usb slot available to charge a device and a small velcro pocket next to it in which you could hold the device like a phone galaxy s g i didnt try the food on the flight to japan or the way back but it seemed to be decent and the stewardess were extremely courteous if i had one bad thing to say about the experience it was that they turned the seat belt sign on way too early in my opinion they had it on about minutes before the plane landed to be fair im not sure if this is standard as im usually sleeping right until we land on other flights all in all id fly japan airlines again,4
jal russia support was very kind to return me full price euro for nonrefundable tickets taking into account my health situation i severely broke my leg and we had to cancel the planned trip to tokyo i emailed to jal support the next day they replied they took decision to return me the full price and in a few days the money were transferred to my account i really appreciate this decision taken by jal russia support now im a very loyal jal client and going to chose them for my japan trip when i recover thank you jal,5
as an ana frequent flyer i had never flown jal however on a recent business trip my organization booked jal round trip from tokyo to seattle i was extremely happy with the quality of service and the cleanliness of the cabin in economy class even though the flight was full keep up the good work,5
the service on jal was excellent the staff was attentive the food was good and there was plenty of food provided the airplane was greatall seats had plugs with the ability to charge your phone and the inflight entertainment had lots of choices,4
since my wife is japanese we travel to japan every years we have two daughters and i also like for them to keep in touch with their relatives from over there every time we have used this airline and the service has always been exceptional,5
this airline is excellent providing a most pleasant and comfortable air travel experience the bilingual staff are truly dedicated to customer service being highly efficient professional polite and kind to everyone food and beverage service provided a quality offering of selections nicely packaged japanese crackers and meal of edible art beautiful presentation and delicious an amazing inflight meal the plane was immaculately clean including the bathrooms which were constantly tidied up during flight down to the toilet paper being given a triangular end fold the flight attendants were highly attentive checking on passengers and amazingly helpful cheerfully assisting with special wheel chairs for those with bathroom needs very impressive airline and staff,5
in addition to adequate ventilation pleasant scents in cabin gave an extra bonus to the flight there are many code shared flights in jal now and i would prefer jal flights if possible,5
i flew delta the past several years but tried jal since it started a direct flight service from seattle to tokyo i felt that i had more leg room in economy seats than i did on delta most difference between delta and jal is the service everyone was friendly professional and patient food was better too i would fly jal again if they keep offering competitive fair,5
we flew japan airline business a couple of days ago from haneda to singapore whilst this was not our first experience of jal business it was the best we chose the japanese meal option and it was better than any restaurant we experienced in japan just the best airline food i think i have ever had,5
jal provided excellent food an attention to detail when presenting my partner with diabetic meals definitely recommend this airline for customer care on long haul flights,5
we flew round trip to osaka from lax on jal the level of friendliness and professionalism on this airline is exceptional even in economy class the flight crew makes you feel special in addition the quality of meals is far above expectations great experience on a very long flight also when arriving in osaka i left my ipad on the plane jal staff retrieved it and returned it to me in the terminal within only a few minutes of reporting itand their agent stayed with us the entire time until the device was returned what great service,5
last minute change my reservation with malaysia airlines was cancelled due to engines problems changed to jal same one world group maybe it was because of the last minute change at narita airport i always requested for fruit platters on board prefer to eat the foods in jal st class lounge before departure however jal very kindly informed me that they do have fruit platters on standby i would recommend that jal do not serve what they call as fruit platters no even at last minute order never seen such sad and old looking fruits should have been in the bin weeks ago,4
good flight online checkin was done smoothly aircraft foot space was wider than i expected food was good however the lavatory wash basin was clogged at the early stage of the flight i asked a flight attendent to clean she did immediately that was good,4
japan airlines are amazingly clean polite and service is second to none premium economy from los angeles to tokyo to melbourne was great obviously it was more roomy than economy but it was more than the physical space that was great the ambient space and overall respectful way that the japanese staff managed that flight was brilliant im already booked into my next flight with them and will not fly another airline to japan if they continue to operate in this way also their vegan option was superb by far the best plane food ive had,5
words can not describe this airline amazing service with smile and attitude very helpful all was clean and nice thank you,5
excellent service great crew good food great concept of having featured chefs good selection of movies and music the long haul haneda to ny was not as bad as these flights are,5
exceptional baggage allowance economy passengers could take suitcases each kg this was especially valuable to me as i was taking a whole lot of sheets towels blankets kitchen utensils etc to help set up a house there for a family member plane left on time seats were very comfortable with extra leg room attendants were very attentive polite professional meals were nice and ample food for the flight,5
the best airline in the world our economy seats are very comfortable and have all the amenities like free movies wifi flight tracker not to mention the best airline food the crew are always very helpful and very courteous the plane was well maintained and very clean it was a hour flight but the bathrooms were always clean whenever i will use it i will definitely book with japan airlines on my next trip,5
great all around airline our airlines in north america could learn something about hospitality and service from them,5
excellent service excellent seats excellent food excellent cleanliness rivals qatar airways and singapore airlines my japanese so especially enjoyed the japanese meals will fly again,5
flight to japan tokyo narita airport took about hours from checking in to boarding everything is a breeze the online auto checkin is rather easy to use just need to register info hours prior to flight the plane interior is very well kept and clean bright and spacious seats are comfortable and with good legroom flight crews are well mannered and very courteous and helpful the inflight system is simple but somewhat lacking contents food is great one of the best i have eaten so far ticket price is attractive and reasonable overall a good recommendation,5
jal always has first class service no matter what cabin you are seated in i especially enjoy the class j seats offered on domestic flights i travel to okinawa frequently for business and have never been disappointed with the service from jal,5
service was great from checkin to arrivalall staff on board the flight were extremely efficient and very professional providing excellent food and wine the best part are the large seatsbig tvelectric privacy screen and the lie flat bed the cabin is kept spotless and even the carpet is cleaned after each meal service there is also a self serve counter with winesbiscuits various snacks and wonderful chocolates jal runs a very efficient service on this route,5
we chose to fly through japan to europe as the fares suited us as well as the seat plane configuration i was very impressed with this airline staff are all immaculately presented and polite the legroom in economy was excellent better than any other airline ive travelled with the seats are comfortable and the seatback is designed to have all sorts of different pockets and hooks to store all your gadgets during the flight free bottled water and bag of snacks provided during the overnight flight some of the other meals were a little peculiar and not to my liking but overall i would definitely travel with jal again the overnight flight to tokyo is direct and hassle free and the seat configuration makes it great for couples no arguments over who is lumped with the middle seat,4
the service was blown me awayeven the ground handler was so thoughtful and helpful i can feel the truly japanese hospitality,5
jal flight is always great food is great too we can order various type beer and wines that makes me feel relax,5
mh was cheaper than jal when flying from japan to malaysia in the past at least business class but recently it is not the case the cost competitiveness of jal from japan to malaysia is the best mostly food entertainment service cleanliness comfortabilityetc most of them exeeds your expectation the flight atendants are supportive and kind which is not so common all over the world if you travel with business class from japan to malaysia select jal it is worth however if you are tall andor big be careful a bit as the leg room is not that big i am cm in height but rather heavy kg in weight so i am big in some sense i do not want to accept i am fat hahaha and felt leg room was a bit narrow except for that mostly everything was excellent,4
jal always serve the best of the best friendly fight attendant with professional manner what i like about it is for the second meal you can choose the time you like and basically you can eat anytime you like the seat are so comfortable it will become your bed degree and they can provide you more cushion if you like,5
the overall flight experience from london to melbourne with jal was very good my two sons and i were issued bulk head seats on the first leg which made for a comfortable journey to tokyo the staff were great the cabin including toilets was kept spotless and the food was pretty good for those on a standard menu my son is coeliac and his gf food was not as good due to some inedible fish upon booking we were informed that the incoming flight would land at haneda and our outgoing flight was from narita but it would be our personal responsibility to transfer across tokyo with a hour layover we were informed that it was possible an hour passed by the time our flight landed late and it took a long time to clear customs at haneda upon exiting we discovered that there we no spaces left for the transfer bus leaving in the next minutes and would have to wait hrmins for the next bus this journey takes approx one hour we opted for the express train option between the two airports however im not sure why express is used at it stopped at all but a few stations went through the tokyo subway system and took almost two hours the strangest part of the process was the requirement to purchase the tickets using cash rather than credit card which necessitated an atm withdrawal i think we arrived a few minutes earlier than had we waited for the next bus but my children enjoyed seeing tokyo from the subway and it was an easy doortodoor journey if long this flight was chosen as we were using points and didnt have much choice i wouldnt pay and willingly choose this flight route,4
tokyo narita airport is rather far from down town tokyo than haneda airport there is however sushi bar counter at jal first class lounge and typical japanese style order and served three kind of selection with a mix andor three single is available it is a weekly menu such as tunamaguro snapper octopus etc there are other counter salad bar and noodle soup ramen counter same as typical japanese style order and served why not enjoy those japanese food before boarding,5
given the typhoon concern the flight was surprisingly smooth no turbulence it was also ontime premium econ very comfortable lounge access for prep econ passengers also a great touch,5
jal far surpassed my expectations the food was quite good there was a balance of food groups my previous flight was united from nrt to sfo and it screamed of cost cutting carbs of chicken and noodles with a noodle salad and bread chicken a la scurvy melted ice cream which is the cooling for part of the main meal the jal meal was attractively arranged on signature red even the containers showed attention to detail i would recommend jal hands down for food the only fault was the plane was uncomfortably hot no one likes to feel like they are short of breath that was the only fault cabins that are too hot,4
i had a great fare for around but chose to do the upgrade bid and won an upgrade for about the week prior to the flight one of the best perks besides the ample legroom on board was being able to eatdrink relax in the beautiful jal airport lounge at lax for several hours before my flight,5
the jal customer service is terrible we arrived to narita airport around pm to transfer to sgn at pm we were noticed that the flight was cancelled due to the typhoon and no one lead us just was told to go the transfer counter and line up there to get help the lobby were filled up with passengers since all flights were cancelled at that time no any slot attendent was out to arrange the lines no any decided for lines so the lines was messed asked the customer service if they had any arrangement for us they tried to avoid the answer kept telling us lining up after lined up for about hrs was told to group together whoever had the same destinationsso we got pulled out from the line and asked us to wait in group and we were waiting for another couple hours the slot attendants decided to take pictures of our boarding passes so we thought we would get to arranged another flight so we waited for another hours i felt something wrong since no one came out let us know what happened so caught a slot attendent asked her what was going on she told us should line up to get help but not waiting in front their working area or we could book another flight online but we must pay for it and i asked her about the boarding pass photos she rejected that they took photos so we ended up lining up again and we have been in the airport hours no food no any info only a bottle of water and they started sending out blankets around am but we had been here for whole night also we were told if we were signed up for another flights we must get out the airport grab our check in luggage and recheck in and no one told us the narita airport closed at night so we couldnt even get out the airport to get a hotel and rest since immigration booth was closedso eventually we all got stuck at the airport couldnt sleep no food no drink,1
the plane was super clean looked literally brand new lots of legspace delicious food and super nice staff,5
so far jal is giving the good service and i like it they provide delicious food and also they have a good wine and beer,4
outstanding courtesy delicious food clean and wellmaintained cabin and lavatory made this length trip a pleasure,5
i took the jal flight from taiwan to boston connected in narita tokyo japan it was a very long flight but jal made it as comfortable as it could be the seat was more comfortable the screen was new and big and the meals were actually good the connecting flight in narita airport was one hour but its easy to find the gate and not too rushed,5
left on time and arrived early service was great airline food was was very good and the free drinks even better,5
was on hold with japan airlines for more than one hour about a flight my family and i were supposed to take to warsaw tomorrow it turns out there was a problem because my husband couldnt input my updated family name on the jal website when booking our flight so he ended up using my maiden name when i called jal the customer service representative at jal flatly told me that i could not possibly board our flight so i should just cancel my flight i said this was impossible since we are traveling with our month old baby the cs rep from jal then suggested we all just cancel our flights and book new flights adding that it was going to be more expensive i was shocked that she couldnt suggest any other solution most airlines to my knowledge allow some name change especially if its a problem with changes from maiden name to a compounded family name but jal was completely inflexible to even suggest just cancelling my entire familys flight we are all packed and ready imagine how difficult it is packing to travel with an month old we are booked at a hotel near narita and my husband is meant to participate in a conference the day after we arrive in poland but now all our plans ruined because jal would not consider our situation in the end we booked a flight with a different airline and we will be departing the day after tomorrow for warsaw i managed to contact jal finally and asked to cancel our flight the second cs rep we spoke to was somehow more helpful and tried to provide some other solution still the problem is that they absolutely do not allow name changes this whole fiasco cost us more than yen not to mention the stress of preparing for an aborted longhaul flight with a baby ive enjoyed the food and service onboard previous jal flights when i was single but it was extremely upsetting to be told to just cancel all our flights when there wouldnt have been any problem in the first place if we did not have any trouble with jals website i will definitely not fly jal again now that i have a family nor do i recommend it to anyone traveling with small children,1
jal hands down absolutely one of the best airlines the flight from narita to dallas was perfect i will definitely start flying with your company more often i would like to give a special thank you to flight attendants kaneko nanami cf kunieda mari for your wonderful conversation and true professionalism,5
i flew on at pm boarding time the gate agents were extremely helpful and friendly the gate agent manager dressed in blue vest was extremely busy with setting up the gate but she and her staff went out of their ways to help me i am extremely grateful and recommend japan airlines to all friends and families,5
both jal japan airlines and ana all nippon airways are my favorites as they have firstclass service even in economyclass for this particular trip i booked a multicity itinerary of new york seoul with a stop at haneda busan tokyo tokyo new york normally i fly ana but since ana does not have a flight from busantokyo i took jal for the first time in several years they did not disappoint the seats feel wider than most us airlines staff is super helpful service is impeccable movie choices are adequate choose your seats quickly especially if you are traveling as a group of two the economy area had threeseat and fourseat rows but very few twoseat rows,5
in typical japanese fashion the airline stewards are amazing nothing is too much trouble the seats i feel are a bit more cramped than other airlines for economy and it made for a long trip,4
premium economy provides extra comfort with the seating but the food is the same as economy it is very ordinary scrambled eggs with minced chicken for breakfast which i found a strange combination the airline stewards gave excellent service,4
seats like business class of old almost however im not used to the seats reclining downwards like business seats and not leaning backwards but definitely clean and quite good service with great tv screen charging port and plenty of space to stow things this comes with slippers and nighttime pack with a mask as well food was good quality and they walk around often serving drinks and snacks bathrooms was spacious for an airplane with a separate bench to sit on in the toilet room clean and well maintained throught the hour flight,5
dreading this hour flight it turned out great the seats were comfortable and reclined to a good pitch the cabin was large and airy it also felt like the pressure and air circulation worked well very little jet lag the bathrooms were large for an airplane plenty of storage space the headphones provided for a list of recent movies were large and comfortable however no eye masks or earplugs were provided so make sure to bring your own if you want them the drinks were all free and readily provided the meals were fine nothing to write home about but not bad i will definitely fly with them again,5

we had planned to book a finnair flight for this trip but ended up with a booking from jal this is worth your money very well organised extremly friendly staff which makes for a wonderful customer service experience and great inflight fb an excellent travel experience which i can only recommend,5
i have a short day trip to osaka from tokyo so that time is extremely tight for me so i rather take domestic flight than high speed train both haneda airport and itami airport are located near city centre compare with others so it wont take long to get to the airport i was impressed by jals extremely efficient boarding arrangement for domestic flight as all the passengers were well coordinate it took around less than minutes for passengers to board the flight though inflight entertainment was just limited to radio and no meal was served only drinks and nuts as i remember i rather stay relax on the comfortable seat than rushing for a meal i have pleasant outbound and inbound journeys and both flights were arrived on time,5
i took the airline from manila to chicago via japan the only unpleasant of the entire trip was transferring from haneda airport to narita in tokyo though i was aware by the time of purchase but find it too uncomfortable transferring with two large luggage in tow but the inflight services of japanese ladies is so good that how i wish my flight is longer food is good even at economy,5
first a word of caution unless you are traveling with an organized group which is taking care of arrangements you must get a visa for vietnam before you leave from the states non negotiable now about the flight wonderful in terms of comfort and service our flight attendants were anxious to please us in any way they could which is what one has come to expect from asian airlines the only aspect we found lacking was the food which was often quite unusual for our palate even the western menu,5
i like jal and their wonderful aircraft and their service however this time i wondered what happened a cabin crew served us but unfortunately her behaviour was not good she looked insencitive all time especially in the night when she asked a passenger at my next seat to shut the windows cover her elbow touched my water bottle in the holder and dropped it with the noise and shock i woke up but she did not do anything not pick the bottle not say excuse me she just took no account of it frankly speaking she was an eccentric person,3
if you have a jal flight you can only board jal wherever you go on various airlines for about years jal is very kind except for the web center about of crew members are also good people however it is difficult for business class to cancel the purchase and i want more jal from centrair,5
恒例になっている年一回の沖縄旅行は必ずjalで行きます子どもが小さいため客室乗務員のフォローは欠かせません安定したサービスが期待できるのでいつも安心して搭乗しています the annual okinawa trip which is an annual event always goes by jal because the children are small it is essential to follow the cabin crew we can expect a stable service so we always board with peace of mindthx,5
jal hands down absolutely one of the best airlines the flight from dallas to narita was perfect i will definitely start flying with your company more often i would like to give a special thank you to dallas gate agents mar samson laila ali and flight attendants doi aigaki for your wonderful conversation and true professionalism,5
i have been a member of american airlines aadvantage for a few years and always try to fly on one world partners airlines whenever possible recently i travelled on japan airlines to tokyo narita from dallas tx as an aa platinum member one world sapphire i have been lucky enough to have been upgraded occasionally on aa but its been a challenge on the partner airlines specifically cathay pacific finnair and british airways i was already prepared for being told no when i asked about the possibility of a complimentary upgrade from standard economy i was pleasantly surprised when the agent smiled thanked me for being a sapphire member and handed me a boarding pass for their premium economy cabin the seat was comfortable and came with a variety of creature comforts including an amenity kit slippers a large pillow blanket and noise cancelling headphones i had more legroom than i needed and the footrest was a nice touch also the seat itself was quite wide had a small privacy divider a large seatback screen convenient storage spots for cell phoneglasses and the seat recline system was kind of cool in that the seat slid down and forward within its own space not bothering the person in back i was able to sleep reasonably well and felt pretty good upon landing after a hour flight overall i was extremely impressed with the premium economy cabin and would certainly consider paying the price in the future looking forward to flying on japan airlines again,5
i was noticed during check in that premium economy class passenger could access to the sakura lounge and i could have a full breakfast before boarding at am the inflght services was excellent with all the necessary amenities provided including slippers plenty of leg room for ft tall passenger like me,5
we were very impressed with our flights in business class from chicago ord to bangkok on jal the flight attendants introduced themselves to us knew our names and were so helpful and kind the seats in business class were very comfortable the food was exquisite the drinks i had champagne and japanese plum wine delicious and overall the service was excellent we usually flight business class and we have had the chance to do so using other airlines and i rate jal number one of the most impressive things for me was how clean and neat the bathrooms are kept during the almost hours flight from chicago to bangkok in other airlines after the first hours you can see how much a bathroom is used during a flight because of the smell spots and dirt on the floor and sink in our flights with jal from chicago to narita airport in tokyo and from tokyo to bangkok and back we didnt see a spot on the floor and there was a supply of toothpaste toothbrush mouthwash and hand lotion until the end of each flight we will continue flying with jal our favorite airline now,5
we got premium economy seats for the hr flight for traveller and enjoyed the space provided even as middle seats in a config enough space to step over sleeping neighbour if needed reclining the seat does not impact the person behind although the seat felt a little used up already the seats were good decent food and drink options and extremely nice and helpful staff also efficient boarding process overall outstanding service,5
we boarded the boeing very smartly we were greeted with smiles even though we were at the rear of the plane the seating was the best we have experienced the accommodation puts qantas and british airways to shame there was plenty of legroom for me m tall the seats were comfortable cabin service was impeccable food was a good average the only disappointment was they ran out of our preferred dish the alternative was fine entertainment was fine with latest release movies disembarkment was very efficient buses were used as the airport is being renovated,5
this was my rd time flying economy class with jal from san diego ca and i am very pleased with all flights including the connecting ones seats are considerably roomy with spacious legroom area food service is good depending on ones taste most important i noticed the lavatory was always super clean i think it was thanked to the ongoing attention from the flight attendants,5
i been traveling to tokyojapan every year thus far and i would never fly any other airline other then japan airlines the airline ticket can be expensive though i do not mind it i love the service that i receive all the time the flight attendants always make me feel at ease and comfortable and i always feel safe when riding with jal too i never had any bad experience with this airline thus far i would definitely recommend this airline to family and friends and to anyone traveling international i been traveling with them for yes or so and counting the attendants are very friendly also i remember last year when i flew into narita airport i was late picking up my luggage so when i went down to look for my luggagethere it was waiting for me at the japan airlines counter and the agents were holding it for me or keeping an eye on it for me i thought that was so nice when i went to pick it up the agents had a smile on their faces which made me feel at ease also they are always on top of things when it comes down to safety toothis is a must for any airline that you travel with i will definitely use them next yr again,5
flying on jal to aomori in august was my st time on jal folks going to aomori to take note that even though it looks direct aomori doesnt have a clearance counter so passengers have to alight in tokyo and retrieve all luggages through immigration and then recheck in again for aomori flight sin tokyo haneda aomori was smooth but seat arrangements was bad and the website didnt allow me to change designated seat at internet check inthis is free for all regular airlines ive travelled with before resulting in middle seats for all of my group aomori tokyo haneda tokyo narita sin no mentioned that other than retrieval of luggages at haneda airport passengers have to make their way from haneda airport to narita airport no free transfer and the bus journey took hour costs yen you have to lug luggage from the belt to the bus and then back to narita airport to check in again i booked a flight from sin aomori sin thinking that i dont have to lug luggages during the transittransfer its the first time on a direct flight that i have to pay for transfer from airport to airport there was no information on this upon purchase of ticket that this transfer is not included in ticket pricing whats the point of buying jal to travel direct from sin to aomori when it feels like its separate bookings i could have bought sq from sin to tokyo and buy a domestic transfer to aomori instead then the shuttle transfer from haneda to narita on my own expense is something thats acceptable,2
the service is great but too much no need to pause the inflight movie like times for meaning less announcements seats are small and tight there was this rude old lady just jestures to the ca to lift her luggage to the shelf and the ca smiles and do it customers are not higher than the staffs other then that its always clean on time,3
flight attendants are top of the line you can expect meticulous customer service on the ground and inflight checkin was smooth and fast as the business class lane was empty baggage claim at del was also quick as our luggage came out first usually choose to sit in the middle and the second cabin k h there are fewer seats which make for a less noisy environment jl uses the b sky suite with the reverse herringbone configuration fullyflat beds let you sleep comfortably meal service is top of the line with western and japanese choices for lunchdinner its a shame the business class tickets dont have a separate security line that would make the whole experience quite comfortable,4
what is surprise that business class ticket did not give you priority lane access haneda airport was surprised that when we sat down was not offered a drink in business class as normal the meal on the flight was fast and fishbased which should be ok unless you did not like fish like me did not like it,3
japan airline has some of the best service in the industry their flight attendants are so professional and caring especially when you have young children something ive never seen before is when deplaning everybody got up at the about same time and we departed the plane in less than minutes us flights and seems like people think everybody needs to wait for them only negative is about a month later we found a cheaper flight for jal after we purchase the ticket and they would not honor the lower cost flight difference,4
the service is very good we got a full meal and a great snack my kids were over the moon because they gave us ice cream they gave them little toys and were very attentive i forgot to inform ahead of time that my boy has food allergies and told them on the flight and immediately they made sure his food was safe to eat they checked all the ingredients and offered me options good variety of movies free beer and wine we flew economy but didnt feel trapped we were comfortable in our seats for the hrs of the flight,5
just the way you want your flight to be uneventful also as is typical with a japanese airline or most any japanese service great service this along with great attitude good food comfortable seating clean bathrooms snacks provided to take as you like all good and ive flown millions of miles,5
i was lucky to have a firstclass experience on jal ive traveled on first class on aa a few times when they still had direct flight between ny and tyo there was no comparison the service food drink selection and bathroom etc everything was better than aa the flight attendants are friendly but keeping distance between customer and staff for return flight i used aa business class i realized that jal service was superb,5
so dissatisfied with japan airlines my wifes ticket apparently shows as an infant and our infant shows as child and after being at japan air kiosk and talking to both expedia and american airlines for hours we arrived hrs early we still werent allowed to board and missed our flight and of course the flight for tomorrow is booked on top of that everyone at these three companies is still saying not our problem how is this acceptable especially with an infant everything is correct in our itinerary but apparently something got lost in translation when transferring to jal but save for one jal worker everyone passed the baton into someone else and now were left stranded in a city w dont live in with our ten month old and no game plan after spending the last seven hours on the phone we were told by expedia that my flight looked like an infant fare because it was so economical to add insult to injury the manager at the jal seatac kiosk refused to acknowledge me a hispanic woman or my husband instead telling her workers to tell me she cant hell me when i was literally in front of her meanwhile she was taking selfies and all smiles with her japanese customers this is unacceptable behavior and now were being told it will be for us to fly out tomorrow i have never heard of such an absolute disregard for customer service as this,1
excellent service on checkin comfortable seats with extra legroom testy and diversified inflight food,5
we recieved helpful courteous gratious and needed services on our recent flights in japan just before leaving for japan my wife was injured and ended up traveling in a wheel chair we had a lot of luggage that was needed for this trip including two carry on bags and four large suitcases not only did jal take care of my wifes needs by transferring her to a wheelchair in the airport at the same location jal checked our bags and helped to get her to the gate and onto the plane it was all done in an atmosphere of graciousness they were incredible,5
i usually travel to abroad once or twice in a year for leisure and business i have used many airlines in past years including emeritus and ethihad but i found this fight very comfortable aircraft was new and with latest features not only the legroom was sufficient even in economy class but hospitality was also excellent i choose the hindu vegetarian meal and the food was par excellence honestly not expected in a airline not belonging to india bar was having wide variety of drinks japanese green tea and roasted tea were the point of attraction as it was giving a feel of japan before actually reaching there infotainment system was very good although hindi movies were very few hollywood programs were in plenty language selection was wide for about languages all the service was with smile every time i enjoyed the flight and landed fresh for the day to come,5
jal is still using an series forcthis route with no premium economy and outdated business class at least in economy the seating is as designed by boeing not the ridiculous the greedy american carriers have squeezed in good and service topnotch for economy but for hours passengers were fanning ourselves because flight crew either refused our requests to lower the temp or the ac system was not capable imagine being too warm for hours,3
jal is a great airline with wonderful service however some of their international flights go into narita international airport and others into haneda it is not worth saving a couple of hundred bucks to change airports for a connecting flight besides the for the transport between the two one has to collect their baggage and recheck it,5
we actually flew with jal twice in the past months both times business class on both occasions the actual flights were okay but the ground service was difficult and frustrating for the the first flight melbourne osaka return in february i had trouble finding our flight on the mobile app and tried contacting their offices well that was just too difficult and frustrating eventually everything worked out but it was unnecessarily frustrating and time consuming for the second flight melbourne madrid return things got worse i booked a business class ticket online and the money was taken when i tried to confirm seats i was told that on one sector there were no business class seats left and we were bumped to economy we were told that wed be wait listed for business and if the business seats did not become available wed get a refund for that sector that wasnt very satisfactory i contacted jal several times in the lead up to our trip and this information was repeated you are waitlisted and may have to apply for a refund hours before the flight i received a phone call to say that we could have business class seats however because the tickets had to be reissued we had to pay additional charges apart from being very annoyed at this new fee i had to spend a considerable amount of time on hold whilst the process of reissuing the ticket was managed by jal very unsatisfactory service and i really wouldnt risk flying with them again,2
this was the best flight i have had in nearly years the service was excellent on the flight and on the ground in tokyo the only issue i had was long lines at checkin in manila but i suspect this was much more due to the airport than jal the food on the flights were excellent a full gourmet meal including haagen dazs green tea ice cream that was far better than anything i have had in economy since i flew on pan am and as a big man the seat belt was large enough to not need an extension i will fly jal whenever i can from now on,5
jal has been my last carrier of choice when flying inbound and outbound from japan has really surprised positively when compared to aa service under one world alliance very punctual courtesy service and very respectful to the passenger provides a great value for the money in economy and business class and for those whom enjoy the emerald status on one world the lounge experience in narita is outstanding by far the best in my history of business travel,5
air japan is a very professional airline with great staff smaller than average seats good inflight entertainment and average food when an issue arose with a drunk passenger staff members handled everything very professional and made all other passengers feel safe,4
we flew economy class from osaka japan to los angeles california usa the service was good and the stewardesses were very polite and helpful the toilets were clean throughout the flight the economy class seats were wider than that of other airlines but the seats were very hard indeed and most uncomfortable the food was reasonably good for economy class,3
even for a short flight like seoul to tokyo there were real business seats which is not the case in europe even for longer flights like paris moscow service was excellent as its always with japanese people they are so sweet kind and attentive toward customers everything went smoothly,5
i use this flight to travel across the us directly to tokyo in the larger dreamliner aircraft for the entire journey its far more preferable than the smaller aircraft used by us airlines to transfer to an international flight at la san francisco or dallas it should be noted though that window skysuites in the jal dreamliners have less personal storage space than the aisle seats but have great privacy and a personal aisle entrance i also like the excellent boston ba lounge made available to jal passengers,5
worn down lounge at suvarnabhumi and osaka airport few food options only and not tasty at all same goes for the flight the western and japanese food tasted terrible the best choice were the paper cup instant udon noodles all in all a disgrace,3
i flew from sydney to tokyo in july i am not a happy flyer but a frequent one this was my first time with jal and i was very impressed economy class was more roomy only seats on the outside rows the food was good the staff very friendly and helpful i then flew with another airline to amsterdam and the difference was so obvious jal really shined,5
no long haul economy flight can be considered comfortable but jals superior service at least makes a hour flight pleasant great choice of in flight entertainment food was quite good in airline terms especially flying out of tokyo which included a jal version of a teriyaki mos burger looking forward to our next flight with jal,4
decided to fly by jal as ive heard many positive reviews about this airline from boarding to transit in narita airport to arrival everything went on smoothly no confusion at all flight attendants to ground staff all very friendly helpful and speak good english but what i really love is the seat i must say is the most spacious seat ive ever experienced you will never regret to fly jal,5
comfy seat delicious food wonderful service i couldnt decide which sake to drink the crew gave me all of them to try then asked me which one i like better and gave me more of it would definitely recommend it,4
after waiting for the airline counter to open they dont open until hours prior to the flights departure we were checked in fairly quickly and were allocated our seats as selecting them online was unavailable to us the aircraft was a boeing version and we were seated in the second section of business class which only contained rows row and whilst we were taking photos of the cabin the flight attendant offered to take a photo of both of us which was very nice of her on the seats were a pillow and slippers the amenities bag contained toothpaste toothbrush ear plugs moisture mask steam eye mask lip balm and tissues the remote control for the seat to be converted to a flatbed was easy to follow entertainment had a reasonably good selection of options with recent movies and tv series the menu had both a japanese option and a western option but you couldnt mix the two it was either one or the other bit of a shame as there were dishes i would have liked to have tried on the japanese menu the western menu main meals were either beef cheeks or ling cod the raspberry mousse cake had gold flakes in it which was interesting you could also order cheese fruit and chocolate from the anytime menu during the flight about hours prior to our arrival we were served a meal the western menu was mushroom frittata with a croissant yogurt and fruit thoroughly enjoyed the flight our section of the business class only had seats in such a huge space and the flight attendants were really friendly and caring wouldnt hesitate in flying on japan airlines again,5
japan airline is an excellent carrier with newer planes enviable seat configuration in first class very clean on time with very good service,5
the seats in economy are very comfortable with plenty of leg room the amenities provided included a blanket a pillow with a cut out to fit your neck and a wide variety of movies games tv shows and music in the entertainment portion of the flight two meals were served and they were excellent during the flight the flight attendants came around offering water juice and a full bottle of water was provided with the dinner menu each seat provided a usb hook up for charging your devices hot towels tooth brushes and small towels were provided to freshen you after the long overnight flight during the meal the flight attendant asked each passenger to return the recline seat to the upright position so that the passenger behind the seat could enjoy their meal,5
just completed a trip first time ive booked jal singaporeosaka via tokyo return excellent experience at a considerable saving as compared to the newly announced no airline for would have no hesitation at flying jal again just one warning if travelling from osaka itami with an international connection there is a separate checkin line and in the morning peak it is very slow took nearly hour to get to the front of the queue,5
premium economy is all one needs for this long flight service is great and the seats provide great leg room and comfort for this long journey,5
i like flying jal to japan because the moment you get on the plane you immediately are entering japan airspace so to speak you are entering japanese culture with a pretty good business class japanese menu the flight attendants are incredibly polite as you would expect and japan airlines at least in business class to me is as good as any airline i like the cabin configurations as well yes there is more space in first class but quite frankly not enough to justify the price difference definitely recommended the only downside is the rules based inflexibility of jal my kids were flying premium economy and they wouldnt allow them to come into the same airport lounge as my wife and i they did have access to the basic international lounge so the of us could only use that lounge to stay together,4
the service was excellent the flight attendants were all polite and attentive and the foods were good also they served miso soup which we cant find in other flight seat was spacious i left behind my pouch in the plane and asked the staff about it when in the immigration theyre very helpful and fast in coordination they even shuttled me to the plane to look for my pouch when we arrived all the left items had been handed over to the lost n found then we headed to lost and found and yes i got my pouch back the service truly reflect the hospitality of the japanese people,5
very pleasant experience recently with jal flight with layovers from manila to san diego boarding procedures in manila were efficient staff made every effort to answer questions and provide customer service before the flight kudos to the flight attendants very responsive and exceptionally courteous baggage handling also well above average bottom line jal pays attention to every detail and makes every effort to provide exceptional customer service good job,4
back couple months ago i took flight back to atlanta first flight is from surabaya to jakarta m hour transit and its been exhausting and when i check in to jal the staff behind counter is very helpful patiently helpfull when i had to arranged the luggage and help with my mother in law thank you mr hendri susanto if im not mistaken his name thank you jal,5
jal socalled business class is basically a fraud what other airlines call business class is the first class business class has slightly larger but still small seats no lounge access no priority boarding no welcome drinks no possibility to hang your jackets paid business class and was squeezed in a row of four in the center of the plane an egregious way of cheating unsuspecting nonjapanese out of their hardearned money avoid,1
my first time flying with jal and they were magnificent the flight left from melbourne a few minutes past midnight a bit of trap and easy to get the day wrong but on time there seemed to be more than average legroom in the economy section and the seat belt was incredibly generous which is really unusual it made for a very comfortable and easy trip i took my own water and was glad i did there was little offered although im sure i couldve asked for some if id needed to,5
a comfortable flight on a small ageing boeing aircraft quite adequate for the hour and minute flight the snack a salad roll was welcome en route nice to get a cup of black tea which was hard to find in south korea no entertainment i guess due to the short flight,5
my experience on jal was wonderful their boarding is easy passengers are welcomed multiple times and acknowledged with direct eye contact and a smile the crew is exceptionally polite and try very hard to anticipate your needs what i found really great was that if a passenger falls asleep during drink or food services they wont wake them but will put a sticker on the seat table so as to be able to provide service when the passenger wakes up finally they provided a pillow added back support pillow and a blanket very enjoyable trip both ways,5
we had a great experience with jal until a major delay on our return trip where the airline didnt even provide as much as a lunch voucher however up until then i would have easily given them stars for service comfort quality of food and courtesy entertainment program was great seats were roomy with plenty of leg room food was delicious and staff was friendly personnel on board was wonderful but ground personnel in tokyo although courteous didnt do much for us with an almost hr delay i would have expected at least some food vouchers we saw them hand cash to japanese passengers but im not sure what their situation was i would fly with them again though our experience on board was great,4
月にお盆の便を予約をしたので 先割で片道万でしたお得 海外旅行ではjalを使ったことがないですが安定の日本品質で快適な空の旅が過ごせるんだろうなと愚考 japan quality very polote well educated cabin crews feel bit sorry that they have to behave that way for an economy flyer like me,3
jl from jfk to tokyo service was excellent dining was fabulous space and bed was amazingly broad some japanese sake n plum wine or western redwhite wine n champagne for the customers to choose nice entertainment system very cozy hours flight highly recommend 空服員笑容可掬 空間是經濟艙至少六人的空間合體 餐點酒類多樣 鋪床附睡衣褲我沒換因美東為白天 娛樂系統電影不少新舊片兼固但國泰更好 皮椅可完全躺平且有床墊舒適棉被 值得推薦,5
fly at nightdepart from narita pm in this flight we didnt apply halal food so only could choose chicken for my husbandbecause i didnt like chicken and no fish menuso i didnt eat all night longonly fruitand vegetable and little cake and hagendaas ice cream so i cant sleep because still hungry and i offered a little bread againand only got different when i fly from jakarta to tokyo on last junethe stewardess gave me breadsbread contain meat and big so i felt full enaught and could sleep well maybe jal serve a sandwich with omelett besides a round little bread next but overall i like fly with jal,4
japan airlines offers the best and most intimate seats in business class the sky suite provides you with full privacy all seats have direct aisle access the any time you wish concept is a plus im looking forward to flying again with jal crew is at all times caring and attentive,5
check in smooth and fastmeals re halal foodtasty and can apply more bread everything is fast and on time we re enjoyed to fly with jalall flight attendant very kind and helpedwe wanna to fly with jal for next destination,5
dear sir my recent trip to tokyo on jl was quite an experience things were going well on flight but the heavy rainy weather around japan affected the flight on its approach to land at haneda it was quite a bumpy ride and turbulent but the calm manner of the flight and cabin crew was very impressive basically it was quite like a mild roller coaster but everyone was calm and the landing perfect,4
food is good they make u stay hydrated unlike korean air and their attendants are always so kind love it,5
we flew premium economy from dfw to tokyo narita then tokyo narita to sydney we flew on boeing for both flights we had access to a lounge at dfw before our flight and at narita between flights this was welcomed especially for the hour layover in tokyo it should be noted that premium economy on other airlines do not always include a lounge visit the is a great plane to fly on and my favorite since i feel better at the end of a flight the seat is a recline in the shell so the seat in front of you will not encroach on your space the legroom is ample the food and onboard entertainment were fine the room under the seat was a little limited the cabin was warm so it was harder to sleep than it should have been the amenities kit was nice the points guy has a review which included pictures of the seats the amenity kit and the food in premium economy overall i would certainly fly jal in premium economy in the future,5
wifi dont waste your money im on a flight from tokyo i to singapore and after hrs i cant get enough data to do anything other tha this mail dont waste your us pathetic,1
from the check in to the landing everything was perfect polite comfortable on time and very well done the staff at checkin were very organised and ready to help nothing was too much trouble and they all were very efficient food on the flight was excellent as were the hosties a really good experience will fly with them next to time japan and then on to london as i understand i can have a day stopover love my days in tokyo i thought signs and language would be an issue but some signds and google translate downloaded without internet was fine,5
i decided to go with jal because my original airlines changed my itinerary twice after booking three months before my trip jal also has routes from san diegotokyomanila staff were very attentive cheerful and kind newer airbus model roomier legroom average size seat width clean cabin and bathrooms boarding and disembarking were smoothly done and on time i did not mind a long layover because all the resources available in narita airport such as customs and immigration and hotel transports that make layovers a pleasant experience my only beef with jal is the food it could be better but please do not take away the real cutleries and the ice cream cupthats my favorite other than that ill fly jal again and recommend it to friends,4
i love the jal business suites very comfortable private and all seats with aisle access perfect for the long transpacific hauls the service is attentive and courteous jal excels in small details like extremely clean bathrooms throughout the flight which some airlines tend to neglect on long flights i also find that the japanese menu which is light but filling excellent for a long flight in any case the additional ondemand menu available throughout the flight is wonderful when the munchies grab you,4
was flying to the states from vietnam via american airlines and the stretch from hanoi to tokyo was operated by japan airlines we were supposed to be in the economy class but got upgraded for free to premium economy and it was literally the best plane ride ive ever been on free wine free udon noodles great inflight entertainment with noisecanceling headphones and ample space the seats recline super far with a folddown foot rest and flip up leg rest the arm rests are quite wide so you dont have to jostle with your neighbor for elbow room plus theres a partition at head level so you have a good amount of privacy couldnt be happier with the flight arigato,5
good seating layout and specious seats flight attendances are very friendly and helpful service is excellence,5
in my many years of travel never have i experience such great pain in doing a transittransfer internationaldomestic while making the booking the jal system auto book us with a gap of hours for a change to domestic plane in haneda airport upon checking in only did we learn that we have to clear full customs baggage be taken out check in again at domestic transfer counter no thru baggage into sapporo and baggage will not be accepted at the transfer counter if you are later than mins to flight departure then it has to be carried all the way to the domestic terminal be checked in there hair stands up in horror arriving at haneda the passport clearance was miles long it took full mins to clear then we dash to the baggage area with the heart thumping all the way found our baggage run to find the transfer counter now its only mins left we see the staffs kept looking at their watches trying to decide if they would accept the several poor souls on the que more heart thumping thank god they accepted the luggage gave us the train tickets as it is too late to take the bus we had to run really run to find the train platform to catch the next train at the domestic terminal clearing the security was another mile long by chance we saw the priority lane we fought for attention of the staff showed our boarding time is almost closing they allowed us to join the priority que by the time we ran to the gate its only mins left our heart was thumping endless what a super big pain how could jal allowed this kind of connection in their ticketing also why didnt provide sufficient upfront information eg baggage will not be checked thru etc to travellers same horror story on the way back when trying to check in on line we realized tho it has a jl plane id it was actually a code share under jetstar means we cant check in online at airport jetstar could not print the boarding pass for the nd lag on jal and jetstar flight was delayed mins heart starts thumping again as we knew the nightmare with insufficient time to transfer this round its narita even bigger more running searching right bus to right terminal etc and the running gets real stressful clearing passport security run dash run dash we arrive at the gate with the boarding started this is the nightmare that i thank god that i survived through but do you want to put yourself through it my advise avoid the pain take those airlines that does direct flights into sapporo not jal that has to transit transfers to domestic flights in tokyo i dont understand why jal process flow and design are not so traveller friendly,2
the seat is roomy and comfortable food is very creative and deliciousthe attendant service is kind and excellent i miss the hot hamburger on breakfast very much,5
my first experienced with japan airlines check in was quick friendly and polite cabin crew the food is fantastic happy flying with comfortable seat will fly with this airlines again love,5
great flight attentive staff my dietary requirements were not passed on to them for some reason but the cabin crew went out of their way to put something together for me it was greatly appreciated,5
had a long layover in osaka from thailand i had injured my ankle and my husband asked the first class lounge for a bag of ice since that is almost impossible to find in the limited space we were allowed in the airport the attendant came out took one look at my foot and ran and got someone they got my ice and insisted on a wheelchair i tried to protest but since i couldnt even get my shoe on i didnt really have leg to stand on pun intended they went back and called whoever was in charge and called all my connecting flights to minneapolis lax to chi to msp there were wheelchairs waiting at every gate shuttle at lax cart in chicago and in msp talk about above and beyond who does that japan air thats who i had priority seating they were very kind to me and the rest of my trip was made so much easier good thing too because my gate at lax was mile away extra bonus we are vegan and the food is amazing as well as very pretty fyi i have never seen airline bathrooms this big everever,5
the aircraft is spacious seats are very comfortable food is highly superior service or the flight crew is implacable every meal is a special surprise its really of superb quality compared to all other airlines great job jal,5
my mom dressed me in a pressed dress shirt my best pants and made sure my hair was combed we were getting on a aa plane to florida the flight attendants all smiles and welcoming serving up hot meals and great service long gone are those days in america welcome japan airlines from the gate at dallas to our final destination narita airport japan we were greeted with smiles and excellent service hot food options hot towels snacks pillows blankets and anything else one might need in a long flight the plane was new including personal entertainment electronic window darkening foot rests and enough lavatories to satisfy anyone just a joy to fly with such a professional airline who hasnt forgotten that we are passengers and guests not baggage and cargo do yourself a favor and treat yourself to with this airline,5
good flight flight was not delayed seating comfort is good even though its a little tight for a feet tall person service is good and professional,4
i flew on jal on the del yvr sector and found the aicrafts to be new with all the modern amenities on board be it the infotainment system usb chargers on every seat the crew is very courteous good legroom nice warm meals served with a smile,5
whenever travelling to japan feel free to book jal as they are the best airlines i have come across so farespecially if you with a toddler you get food varietymilk basic needs etc and a great airline staff amazing seats and leg space that you get in this airlineyou can surely give it a try and i am sure you wont be disappointed,5
the toilet is always so clean like a star hotel with washlet normally i hate meals on the airplane but the food taste great and they have hot miso soup on the plane the service is also impeccable all and all awesome experience id definitely want to pick japan airlines if i am going to fly to japan next time although it is not cheap yet but thats what you need to pay for the excellent customer service,5
i travelled to tokyo from melbourne by jal in economy class in may this year the seats were comfortable the aircraft was clean and modern boeing and the customer service by jal airhostesses and cabin crew was excellenti would recommend jal and fly by them again,5
i always love to fly with japan airlines there is considerably more leg room than average airlines and the flight crew are very friendly and nice,5
great service and excellent food the jal dreamliner economy seats have to be some of the best with heaps of foot room and very comfortable seating my only criticism is that sparkling wine doesnt seem to be available in economy although i have had it in premium economy previously the flight attendants are always smiling and go out of their way to assist,5
clean good service flight on time the flight going is small plane and return journey is big plane,4
paid extra for long haul to europe this was first leg customer service was excellent seats were comfortable bed was better when i realised there was a mattress in the overhead locker silly me transit lounges were also much appreciated,5
excellent customer service the hostess remembers and delivers my onboard requirement excellently onboard entertainment was great and kept us occupied throughout the flight departure and arrival time was punctual seat arrangements are good in a xx seats arrangement however check in service is slow and can be improved by allowing an extra lane for those who have done the internet check in to drop off their bags,5
i flew jal for the first time i did fly one leg in business and the other in economy i loved this airline they have the best inflight food of any airline i have ever been on and am going to be flying them as much as possible in the future i had a day stop over in tokyo and they were amazing to deal with,5
it was a long hour flight for my family and i with young kids and i was initially quite apprehensive about it but it was good first of all the attendants were really friendly and polite some of them could only speak a little english but they make it easy by giving you cards to look at and point out what you wantneed the kids were given a good quality welcome toy and the kids meals were really cute throughout the flight they will periodically offer waterjuice without having to ask for it the seats were comfy slightly wider than usual and they have snacks near the service counter for you in case you cant sleep and felt like munching something i would definitely fly jal again if i have the chance,5
we spent some time considering premium economy and business class on our jal flight in the end considering the length of the flight and the need to move around we decided on business class it was a very wise choice because we had individual compartmentalized seats that we could raise and lower partition screens we had a true sense of privacy the seats reclined and raised in a variety of positions so we never felt cramped or hemmed in on top of all this the service was stellar the stewardesses were concerned for all of our needs and were extremely helpful the best of any airline i have ever flown the food was exceptional and help was immediately available regardless of the hour additionally access to the first class lounge was included it was an amazing experience from check in through arrivals i could not have asked for kinder better attention from everyone i consider the flight especially one of this length as a day of my trip i cannot imagine spending it in discomfort,5
super airline and while my japanese is very limited the ground and onboard staff always make my trip so easy online checkin for nonjapanese is a little cumbersome but with the help of my office team is possible,5
worth paying the extra monies our car service picked us up earlier than we had requested so we arrived before jal even opened their counter we were first in line and when it was opening time staff marched out together lined up in front of the counter and then bowed to whomever was in line then because we were so super early we were given coupons to their lounge the lounge was stocked with snacks even sushi for a bit and all you can drink including alcohol lounge was located above so there was a view for people watching once on the flight staff regularly fed us with meals snacks and drinks there were also a selection of movies and all the comforts were provided including headsets check to see if there is a food difference between economy and economy premium if more leg room is necessary weigh all that against cost difference,5
i just have to say that even flying economy was almost as good as first class being a sapphire member with american airlines sure has its perks japan air coshares with american and they are definitely worth it thank you,5
the foreign airlines japan australia and canada are so much better than united free food and free entertainment package japan airlines took it to another level of service the flight attendants were so service oriented they came around with water numerous times the seats were huge and comfy compared to united i will definitely use them again to go japan,4
so my wife had to go to the philippines to see her sick father basically she had a hour delay in tokyo they said it was because of weather in beijing i checked the weather in beijing to tokyo when she was flying and the weather was beautiful but if there was weather problems that is not where my complaint is she had to catch a connecting flight to her home town on a different carrier so the delay caused her to miss that flight they told her in tokyo that they would take care of it very poor english they should have better speaking english employees if they are going to fly from the us so she got to manila went to the ticketing counter of japan air to get another flight to her home town nope said they could not help her because it was not japan air they dont fly to her home town i called japan air while she was in tokyo and they told me they would accommodate her they also told her that an hour and a half connecting to air asia was not enough time to get there thats irrelevant however its in the same terminal and it has only taken me minutes to get there when we have done that trip before so the guy at the counter said that he could get her a flight for to her home town because they work with that airline he went on the internet to find her one i could have done that and cheaper i spoke with him too poor english and rude like he did not care so in the end she went to the air asia terminal took minutes to get there and had to buy another ticket that was hours out and it took hours for nothing at the japan ticket counter lies lies lies i will never fly on japan airline,1
food awful yes many japanese traveling to the us and food reflected that but many americans traveling back home felt the plane was just dirty i didnt take the plastic bag off the pillow put my jacket between my head and pillow and wouldnt use the blanket i usually wipe down tray table and things i might touch but this time i wanted to wipe down the seat and walls between seats if anything really necessary was said by the flight attendants or pilot we would never know because we couldnt hear or understand either never again,2
my fiancé i flew business class london manila july we had to change airports in tokyo ie landed in haneda transfer to narita fine we knew there would be some disruption but we were not prepared for the complete lack of service from jal upon check in at heathrow we were assured that the transfer was common occurrence and would happen seamlessly in fact there would be someone to meet the flight and aid us since we had to get through immigration collect our bags considering we were business the check in at heathrow wasnt professional up to the standards of most font line international carriers they share veryl limited facilities with ba so i boarded in london with some misgivings which i expressed to the purser she allayed my fears stating the transfer was common practice would radio ahead so now the flight was great food good service excellent hours of top class flight disembarked to find no one waiting for us approached one attendant holding a little card was told to go through immigration collect our bags go to the bus counter buy a ticket for narita what a bun fight it took an hour fifteen to get through the queue only to be told we were at the wrong counter half an hour later we got to the carousel to collect our bags to their credit our bags last to be collected they had an attendant with the bags i explained our predicament and was told to go through into the concourse and buy a bus ticket no room on the busfull half hours left no jal staff within coowee i had to leave my fiancé who was totally stressed with the baggage go upstairs to arrivals in order to attempt to sort out the situation no help told to take a taxi by this stage our connecting flight was due to take off in just under hours taxi driver was great he realised the gravitas of our situation sped to narita he did what jal should have done cost of cab aud eventually got through boarded to be told no western food they had run out dont give me that sitting in d in a half empty business class no western food came aboardthere is more but ive bored you enough dont touch jal unless youre desperate good if nothing out of the ordinary happens but no backup a disgrace i travel heaps and without doubt the worst asian airline,1
what a great place to be for hours premium economy on this flight was excellent with great entertainment comfortable seats and cabin crew that care,5
we flew by japan airlines for the first time as we usually take emirates we were amazed how excellent the service was all the air hostesses were very friendly and helpful food was great and the seating was very comfortable the fare was much cheaper than emirates but quality of service was much better also for economy class passengers are allowed to take two bags of kg each plus hand luggage kg we definitely will advise to fly with this airline and this will be our first airline of choice,5
jal is a terrific airline and their business class is pretty impressive starting with the lounge at jfk which was way more than i expected great food relaxing atmosphere and a selfserve bar boarding was quick and easy and the onboard staff could not have been nicer or more attentive the business class seats are staggeredmeaning you do not have to bother the person next to you when getting in and out of your seat the seats also flatten to a bed a nice plus on a hour flight i was lucky enough to get a window seat the window seats are very private especially when you raise the divider between you and the next seat the aisle seats in business class can feel a little busy with aisle traffic both food and service were amazing i love that they have asian and western choices on the menu i kinda tried them alland they were all great a lot of great choices for inflight entertainment you have to pay for internet and its not cheap there are also some great little amenities onboard i will definitely be flying with them again,5
i have flown on jal before but it has been a number of years ago i forgot how great the service is on this airline all of the flight attendants are focused on making your flying experience an enjoyable one as a result this flight seemed to be shorter than i thought it would be i have decided to use jal more often when i fly to asia in the future,5
this was the best flight i have ever been on in the beginning i wasnt looking forward to the hour flight but it was very good the service was amazing they serve hot meals in the hour flight drink no cost hot towels served before you get your meals ect another thing that is great is the japanese people and how they travel every time you get on an airplane with a bunch of canadians and americans in is a painful experience i am canadian the canadians and americans dont know how to act as soon as the flight is in the air they are standing up and digging in the overhead compartments or letting their young kids run up and down the isles and walk around staring and invading others space the movies on the flight were all free and all new releases with many to chose from getting on and off the plane was very organized it was a very pleasant experience,5
when we checked in for our flight we were told we would not be seated together but after my wife told them it was my th birthday and she would like to sit together we were told we will see what we could do when boarding the flight we were greeted by its a double celebration we upgraded you too premium economy and we have bought you a present a lovely hip flask from harrods the flight was lovely and the food and wine couldnt be any better at the end of the flight the cabin crew gave me another gift a model of the plane with happy birthday and flight number written on the top all together a great experience from japan airlines,5
first time on this airline and was really surprised at how nice it was for an economy ticket big seats lots of leg room food was better than most airlinesand served with real silverware service was outstanding i really thought i was in premium economy classplane looked like a new one i would fly again no problem check in was quick and easy very nice service for economy class,4
fantastic crew greta food very comfortable seatflat bed used miles to get the first class experience great value,5
the premium economy seats were comfortable for a long flight the facilities were clean the food was good the staff was friendly and courteous the entertainment was ok,4
overall i will highly recommend they have great seats and they also offer free use of their lounge which comes with a shower,5
boarding was quickcrew was efficientthe airplane a south american plane wasnt comfortable didnt feel safe it was a short flight due to heavy turbulence i was sick but the crew just ignored it i was happy whn i could get of the plane,4
my first long international flight and it was great the space was good chairs were as good as you can get for economy entertainment great all the movies etc food and beverage service was great i didnt get to pick my meal since they were all gone however i was extremely surprised by my seafood dish which was excellent i enjoyed the staff they were very nice and made me feel comfortable i would definitely fly on jal again,5
comfortable flight lovely professional staff and definitely the best airline food ive ever had the plane had a nice area with drinks and biscuits that you could access between meals and i felt comfortable moving about the cabin,5
just flew jal to japan for a two week holiday direct flights from melbourne to tokyo the flight staff are very professional and make sure everyone has what they need on the flight home the food was delicious the food was designed by a top winning chef i chose the vegetarian curry option that included salads and desert followed by icecream before we landed we got a make yourself burger which was also a novel idea and delicious would fly jal again,5
i havent even flown but the ground service is appalling whilst confirming my flight information everything looked fine correct and ready to go so pop i confirmed it turns out after picking my seats my names are magiclly misspelled while on different forms of confirmations i have correct spelling took me hours to even connect to a human being when i finally connected i was treated as if i was stupid and badgered at for making sure my name was correct i have screen shots and copies of my confirmations with correct spelling ive been waiting days stressing over this whole ordeal they cant manage to help ease this tension it seems as if theyre so set on just waiting untill its too late to cancel where my fees will double this whole time i havent been treated as a paying customer but rather a criminal i dont suggest using this airline at all the inflight service could be good but i wouldnt know i cant even manage to get my tickets fixed,1
very good service friendly staff and the food was delicious jal has engaged world class chefs to develop their inflight menu and i appreciate it my only complaint is it felt that i had slightly less leg room than air canada im nearly though so i always feel a little squished i was traveling with my visibly pregnant wife and the staff at jal in the airport and on the aircraft treated her very well and ensured she was given priority without us having to ask it not only made us feel special it was nice to see that the airline values family and is happy to accommodate the slightly more difficult task of flying around in that condition,5
i have been flight to japan many times and tired various airlines such as british airways sas and finnair japan airlines is by far better than any of the others the service is on a whole different level the staff is very polite respectful and helpful the flight is a lot calmer and passes faster the food is excellent even in economy worth every penny,5
experienced world round trip on one world group ay ba aa and jal ays new a c class seat was comfortable and flight attendant were friendly food and drink were standard ba flight inside europe even it was very short flight they served food and drink efficiently just worked for service in time then ba long flight c class seat arrangement is not very comfortable because seat side by side are sitting looking each other space among seat was minimal ba lounge at heathrow was good aa service inside usa was minimum poor food and drink service same as other us base airline after these flight experiencs jal flight from san francisco to haneda was the best check in lounge service inflight food and drink and flight attendant when you have choice among one world flight my recommendation is use jal,5
we flew on two separate jal flights one bangkok to tokyo one tokyo o seattle we really enjoyed both of these flights though any airlines economy seats suck for legroom sorry it seats shouldnt recline when its this tight we adored the flight attendants on both flights friendly efficient food was ok i ordered gluten free and all meals were fish which i enjoyed but their idea of fruit was two separate dishes of the same melon ugh but we would definitely fly jal again,5
the service you get from the crew members were excellent they were very polite in every way also little things like a free toothbrush in the toilet helped a lot the toilet was always kept clean by the staff,4
only seats in economy in their so the space is maximized to give extra pitch and larger seats nearly premiumfood and staff stunning as expected in any japanese business it was a really great flight i will certainly fly again on jal,5
i took the long haul flight from tokyo narita to san diego on jal i flew in from bangkok and had a short connection time of one hour to make the flight scheduled for departure at pm but found that the san diego flight was delayed as there had been a gate change from one end of the terminal to the other as a result boarding was delayed and we pushed back about minutes late there was a long wait for takeoff due to the many flights taking off from narita at that time of the evening and it was around pm before we took off the flight was operated using a b on boarding i was pleasantly surprised that the plane was outfitted with jals sky suite fully flat seats instead of the angled flat shell flat neo seat that i expected based on seatguru the sky suite seat is wonderful not only does it convert to a fully flat bed but there are also narrow shelves and counters all around the seat and little storage nooks here and there plus storage under the legrest for a carry on bag meal service on the flight was dinner which was delayed and then service interrupted part way due to turbulence after the main meal was served many snack or second meal options were available for any time service according to the menu salad jal trademark curry ramen or udon sandwiches cheeses japanese and western set plates the choices were too plentiful to sample even on a long haul flight for dinner i had the japanese meal which featured seared wagyu beef and grilled black cod before the appetizers and main was served there was also a really delicious amuse buche of sesame tofu with wasabi and sweet corn flan with sea urchin cabin staff asked me whether i wanted to be woken for the second meal prior to arrival and i opted to be woken and ordered the japanese plate with roast beef roll eventhough both meals had miso soup the two soups were very different ones a thoughtful touch in variety as always the meals on jal were delicious and beautiful to behold notwithstanding a very turbulent flight with the seat belt sign turned on repeatedly i managed several periods of good sleep of a couple of hours each jal has added an airweave mattress pad for sleeping these were stored in the overhead bins and when i was ready to sleep i unzipped the package and the pad folded out easily to cover the seat converted to a bed i thought the pad probably about an inch thick did make a difference in making the seat more comfortable as a bed despite the delayed boarding from the change of gates and the long wait for takeoff due to narita traffic the flight arrived in san diego only about minutes late i enjoyed the flight very much and thought the many choices for any time dining after the main meal service and the airweave mattress pad which jal has added made the flight even more enjoyable than prior long haul jal flights i have taken would love to repeat this long haul experience if flying on the same route again,5
i took an early morning flight from bangkok suvarnabhumi to tokyo narita on japan airlines booked as american airlines aa as the flight is scheduled for am i arranged for a am car from the millennium hilton bangkok which arrived around am due to the light traffic that early in the morning after a quick and courteous check in at the jal first class check in from my one world alliance status i used the priority security lane to quickly pass through passport control and was in jals sakura lounge the lounge is very large and as jal did not have many flights early in the morning it was mostly empty there is a full buffet of food including western eggs and sausage but also japanese offerings like yellowtail and daikon kelp in soy sauce sweet potatoes cooked jelly mountain vegetables japanese style buns stuffed with noodles and more not that i needed the food as the millennium hilton bangkok thoughtfully put together a packed breakfast with ham and cheese sandwich pastry breads fruit and orange juice the lounge has a good view of the departure gates and the runway the flight was operated using a b configured xx in business class with angle flat seats shell flat neo we pushed back on time at am flight time was estimated to be hours minutes and we arrived on time at pm meal service was lunch shortly after take off and drink service i opted for the japanese meal since i generally find the japanese meals better than the western ones on jal i was not disappointed as the meal was delicious i found the angled flat seat actually quite comfortable for napping and as long as i positioned myself at the correct place on the angled flat seat i did not slide down on the seat it is also relatively wide i had seat d the first row so i did not have the cabinet in front of me with the video monitor that other rows have and therefore it was very easy to exit from the seat legroom was also very good in the first row the video monitor for first row seats has to be retrieved out of the armrest and is smaller than for the other rows however the entertainment system for jal is not its strongest point anyway so it did not bother me jal has a smaller range of english movie choices than other airlines and most of the movies in other languages have japanese as a subtitle choice instead of english as always service on japan airlines is superb and courteous and the washrooms are kept very tidy by constant cleaning by the cabin crew overall no complaints and a very enjoyable early morning flight,4
be warned that japan airlines does not allow reserved seats for economy class was allocated seats which were separated from my travelling partner they have very poor seat allocation system as the person beside me was a single traveler and they could have just made the seat arrangement for people travelling to sit together instead of separate not worth the price paid as could have got better service and seats on other airlines such as singapore airlines at similar price,2
the travel agent that i was working through for this flight booked the wrong date for the flight when they tried to change it jal refused to do anything about it even though it was a mistake and i caught the mistake within hours after repeated attempts by myself and the travel agent responsible jal still refused i offered to pay whatever fee was necessary to fix the flight dates but their customer service refused to listen to my situation they had an appalling lack of willingness to help me with a situation that was out of my hands i cant use the flight on the day it was booked so now i have effectively paid dollars for nothing as good as they are at the flight itself i cannot recommend this airline because of their customer service they were totally willing to make me pay for a completely new flight,1
great flight and experience started with the lounge enjoyed the admirals club in nrt airport great customer service working on the seats for my family ppl not sure why but in the reservation my family got split up so we had to work on that mostly accommodating were able to get me and two kids near and then wife two rows ahead worked well enough customer service on boarding and inflight was excellent kids got toys and flight attendants were very friendly to them best parts of the flight yamazaki whiskey seats i fit in to sleep food yes the food and drink probably the highlight of the flight they served a wagyu beef was excellent not just regular tenderloin this was a legit wagyu cut steak fortunately i was able to eat mine and then my kids already asleep i had to suffer with their portions didnt want the food to go to waste and the yamazaki to wash it down was wonderful i have another jal flight booked next month and i am very much looking forward to it,5
this is my first review for jal checking was ok the check in person was not the most friendly when i said items are fragile she made me sign the tag and said airline not responsible when i said the items are good now so it is their responsibility if they are broken she gave me a lot of lip in return not the best first impression luckily nothing was broken and cases were just fine the flight itself was good family and i slept well flight crew was very nice and friendly with the kids gave them gifts i liked that the crew did not wake us up for food but rather asked us before we fell asleep if we wanted food or not hakushu whiskey on board most importantly i am and i fit in the lay down seats very comfortable,3
we had a comfortable flight from sydney to tokyo the aircraft was new dreamliner with sufficient legroom comfy seats and good interior ambience inflight food was at average level as compared to qantassq on this route also we felt that the inflight crew were bit lost in their attempt to provide the best service overall an average experience and value for the money we paid for our discounted fare flights,3
we had high expectations for jal on this flight but were let down by the service and the food as a non fish eater i was disappointed to note that the second meal was only a fish option absolutely no alternatives which meant we didnt get a meal and then the whole cabin stunk of fish making me want to throw up this is the first time as a platinum frequent flyer of many years that ive ever come across this and was severely disappointed in addition to add insult to injury the stewardess singled me and my partner out to put our seats up dont have any problem with this during the meal service but they did not ask the couple in front of us to put their seats up which left us cramped and squashed overall although the product is not too bad i would not recommend flying jal,2
very good service and the staff was extremely courteous and friendly however the food left a lot to be desired i have experienced this in the past as well when i have flown with japan airlines if jal improved the quality of their food they would get a top rating from me,4
japan airlines the most systematic airlines which i ever had the ground staff are so friendly to assist whatever doubrs we had even the airplane which the seats are so confortable in legs space compare to other airlines moreover the japan airport its so covenient weather its in nagoya chubu airport or haneda international airport or narita international airport easily find the hotel nearby and even in the airport easily can see the direction board to tell you the train station limousine directions etc so convenient easy to find and no stress during your travel,5
it was round trip from bangkok to osaka recently seat allocation brand new airplane window is electronic sunshade seat pit is wide legroom is good if youre average heightpro cleanliness politeness of crew services in flight entertainment it was a hours of comfortable trip conmeal they served on economy just only one choice and their taste is below average even miso soup for anything else cant complain compare with their competitors like thai airways ana jal is in the middle it is one of the good choices for your japan trip,4
it has been more than years since i last flew jal i had to go from japan narita airport to kaohsiung after arriving from the us given the schedule i had two choices the lcc vanilla air or jal i am glad i chose jal despite the slightly higher fare boarding started on time to a remote stand via bus the flight was operated by an older er but it has been retrofitted with larger luggage overhead bins and jals awardwinning skywider economy seats at inch width and inch pitch these are probably the best economy seats in the industry in terms space and comfort the ife is also stocked with plenty of movies and music service is executed with traditional japanese professionalism and precision i noticed some of the crew members were able to speak mandarin to the chinese passengers not being a fan of airplane meals the meal was actually quite good for economy class and it came with a small haggandaz green tea ice cream i dont think you would find that on too many hour regional flights we arrived at our destination on time although i was quite tired from having just flown in from the us and got virtually no sleep i still found this jal flight to be a pleasant one,5
detailoriented cabin extremely comfortable seats professional cabin crew and excellent food choices,5
ive been flying jal executive class business class since and have visited japan more than times since joining the jal mileage bank something i didnt do for many years ive spent over on jal i always appreciated the fact that if i booked over the phone they would allow me to reserve flights well in advance about ten months and i would not have to pay until two weeks prior to the flight not once did i ever cancel those flights i always honoured my arrangements with jal i am a sapphire tier customer for all the good it does me now jal in their wisdom have decided that there is no more buy now pay later deal in other words they have seriously downgraded their level of customer service certainly i can appreciate that there are some potential customers who cancel their bookings late i however am not one of those people my loyalty to jal and the fortune i have spent on them over the years means nothing to them they show no loyalty to me being a sapphire tier customer means you get a shiny blue card and bugger all elsethe way jal treats its best customers is a disgrace,3
japan airlines has got really good service both in flight as well as ground i flew and the seats were really comfortable in business class full flat the crew was really good and helpful the biggest issue is with the food and beverage on board the beer on board is only ashi which unfortunately is not that good there are no other international beer brands the other drinks are saki there are few international brands of alcohol as far as food is concerned there are predominantly two choices japanese and western on any flight the japanese is understandable and is mainly fish and see food i am allergic to fish and seafood so cant eat it the other option is western which is beef and fish universally on all other airlines it is chicken and vegetarian this shows how much knowledge the featured chef have of the world cuisine even on the flights to and from india which had about indians the menu was exactly the same most indians dont eat beef and lot of them are vegetarian imagine what will they eat all airlines cater to the local taste rather than forcing what they like if you are going to fly jal please pre order your meal,4
nice extras like squash and sweets included as part of the service check in bags included in the price of booking up to kg which makes it nice and simple and no need to book in additional luggage after paying for the flight good times for leaving and departing we were given an exit seat and asked if we would mind which was fine for us,5
everything about this flight was perfectfrom checkin through arrival granted it was just a few hours but you know youre having a great experience when you dont want the flight to end it was my first time ever on a dreamliner and i was glad it was on this airline the aircraft bb was squeaky clean had a modern cabin with new window tinting technology and configuration legroom was wide the seat k was comfortable the ife screen was large with a good entertainment selection excellent service quality and efficiency were evident throughout the flight food was equally excellent as expected on a japanese carrier,5
i was looking forward to flying jal because my dad flew with them before and had a good experience my concern on this flight was that i bought my ticket separately from the rest of my family and therefore was afraid we could not sit together however i give the airline credit for making adjustments so that i could sit with my wife and young children the flight was uneventful which is the best type of flight flight attendants were friendly and professional they also gave our children jal souvenirs which made them really happy the food wasnt bad i had fish which was moist and tasty the seats had plenty of legroom inflight entertainment was all right but most of it was geared towards japanese passengers overall i was glad to have flown with jal and had a pleasant experience,4
from checkin to modifying seat assignments and meals served jal has a very comfortable package with excellent service my main complaint it that the movie selection was limited especially as the origin was in the us however i compensated by listening to some of my favorite classical music,5
very professional and helpful though we were unlucky when we were checked in as a trainee was doing it and she made some mistakes and took us quite a bit of time to complete check in aircraft was very clean food presentation was absolutely great and food was decent landing was good and on time,4
checkin was quick being am there werent too many people around the attendant allocated our seats as selecting them online wasnt available to us at the boarding gate we were in the priority queue which didnt take long to board the aircraft the aircraft was quite good and had a good feel to it we were seated in business open suites and in a middle row sidebyside with a divider between us on our seats were a pillow menu blanket slippers and an amenities bag which contained a toothbrush tissues moisture mask steam eye mask lip balm and ear plugs i was taking photos of the business class cabin as you do and the flight attendant offered to take a photo of us which was a nice touch the western menu had tiny serves of courses being smoked salmon fennel soybeans tandoori chicken followed by asparagus tart seared tuna sashimi agrodoice shrimp with chia seed sauce mains was either roasted duck leg with jus sauce or beef fillet steak with brown butter balsamic sauce migas dip wild rice gratin dessert was blueberry cake bottles of water were available throughout the flight as were the items on the anytime you wish menu entertainment had a good selection and the movies were quite recent all the flight attendants were friendly and respectful overall an enjoyable hr flight,5
jals business class cabin configuration is almost as bizarre as british airways access to the window seats is via a very narrow lane even a moderate size person has to turn sideways to get through only the windowside aisle seats have any accessible storage all the others have storage behind the headrest which means you have to get out of the seat to access on this particular flight food was very average in choice and quality service was ok,3
this is the first time we have flown jal and we had a great flight with plenty of legroom the flight attendants were friendly and the restrooms were kept clean during the flight meals were above average no hesitation in flying with them again,5
our flight with japan airlines was all that we could have wanted the aircraft was very clean and the seats comfortable the staff were immaculate and very respectful catering to all our needs we enjoyed the food with a choice of japanese or western and liked being provided with warm refresher towels twice during the flight the toilets were clean and toothbrushes and razors were available,5
we have taken many jal flights tofro japan in our annual times to nihon our feel is always the international flights are better than the domestic ones overall oopsnevertheless would like to share the most recent trip experience in latemay when we took jal from sg to hnd a redeye flight it is hours journey the embarking and checkin was good as other airlines the takeoff was on time and orderly inside the cabin the seat legroom and aisle spacing was respectable especially for us asian but agreed with some ta reviewers that the inflight entertainment is only average movies are ok not too dated but the audio is mainly japanese and korean if english be prepared for more selection of oldies songs than contemporary the chinese selection is minimal though there is a personal entertainment screenpage the programs are all in japanese meal wise always something to look forward to it is probably in japanese airlines that they serve warm miso soup really refreshes us beside the hotcold green tea just like to highlight an incident that i believe speaks volume of their good customer service it was midway through the flight and light were off resting time i was thirsty so i approached them for a warm water minutes later the air stewardess came back with one and with a lid cover over it apparently worry that it will spill andor ensuing the temperature will not drop so quick a small gesture but i take it very positively we will continue taking jal if the timing slot is good and also believed all passengers will continue to receive attention and good service throughout their journey,4
overall experience with japan airlines has always been good as their crew is warm and friendly as what japanese usually portray themselves to be on this return flight from narita to singapore the crew serving the aisle i was sitting at was especially attentive to my kids the food on japan airlines is always good even a simple porridge dish for breakfast can be made so amazing,5
always a joy flying with them the crew is always pleasant the airline always selects a catering company which prepares super small neat portions but very yummy i love passing through narita or haneda airports in japan please fly with jal hands down one of the best out there,5
i would say this is one of the best airlines i have flown with the entertainment has current and older movies and games for kids good was great and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient they couldnt do enough for you price return from melbourne was very reasonable as we managed to get their first birthday specialfrom melbourne to tokyo for i hope to fly with them again,5
i was on a short flight just under hours everything seemed okay until i requested a blanket at first the staff was handing out the blankets walking down the aisle and i asked for one it was not wrapped in a plastic bag i thought it was a bit odd but took it anyways when i looked at it there was a stain on it so i handed it back telling the staff that it was no longer needed then after takeoff it got quite chilly inside the cabin so i requested a blanket again hoping that they wouldnt bring be the one with a stain this time fortunately they handed me a different blanket i was very relieved but when i took it in my hand i smelled this horrible filthy smell at first i tried using it just cover my legs but i couldnt bare the smell i just dont understand why they wouldnt notice this smell before handing out it was disgusting and i so regretted touching it after that everything in the cabin seemed filthy and dirty and i felt very very uncomfortable,2
the routes flown laxnarita hong kong haneda naritalax cabin premium economy the equipment er cabin layout and cabin system check in separate fast and efficient check in for premium economy passengers at lax and hong kong and narita bags get priority gooooooooooood lounge access lax as a premium passenger you get lounge access at lax but jal does contract with a basic lounge provider at tom bradley not as good as norwegian premium economy passengers getting the one world business lounge but the jal lounge at lax is in my opinion way better than most plaza premium and priority pass lounges i have been too around the world also virgin atlantic pe passengers dont get a lounge and neither do air new zealand passengers the los angeles lounge has some sandwiches cup of noodles snacks a small outside seating area good wife and boooooooooooze enjoy good the lounge jal contracts with at hong kong is qantas business and this lounge is the bombcom it is a very very very big comfortable lounge way better than any business lounge at lax or sfo or jfk or newark pe passengers on jal get to use this lounge amazing food is good alcohol selection is good not as varied as one world lounge lax but the food is way better than what they serve at lax one world business lounge the flagship sakura lounge naritagoooooooooooood better than most us airlines international lounge and aa admiral club lounges as pe you get access food is good booze is good the seats inches of pitch gooooooood better than united pe american virgin all of ana some of air new zealand most of cathay pacific fleet but not as generous as norwegian norwegian offers or depending on the equipment flying but the seat is very functional and spacious and you will have enough legroom the controversial thing about the seat is that it slides forward to recline rather than slides back frankly for a premium economy product nothing beats the recline on norwegian pe seats and their pitch is good too so i was not a fan of the jal recline but they make up for it in so many ways jal fas they are the best in the world besides the gulf carriers they are prompt friendly and kind and willing to serve the food you will not starve on a jal pe flight snack after snack udon de sky probably the best economy food offered in the sky not enhanced food like virgin or air new zeleand but when you have lounge access you tend to have your meals at the lounge instead of eating on the flight unless your flying a solid business class like qatar airways or turkish airlines business catering again for economy food it is pretty good also you get hagen daz icecream and snack after snack after snack goooooooooood my advice is eat at the lounge and if the food is good eat the airline meal but enjoy all the yummy snacks and udon de sky and the hagen daz overall i will fly jal again i normally fly business class when going overseas but when i am paying for people and not traveling alone pe is the way to go with jal,5
japan for tourism is awesome friendly safe go with proper planning to enjoy not that expensive as people think theres an agent at delhi who does good planning if anyone wants her link i can give,5
the flight was on time and orderly boarding is straight forward though security clearance and luggage check in took a while advise jal domestic pax to be at the luggage check in counters mins before take off instead the inflight entertainment is everything is in japanese though you have a personal entertainment screen but the programs are all in japanese is not movies or anything just some japanese travel program which i did not understand a peep even the jal wifi programs on gogo system were all in japanese and very limited flight is comfortable and the gifts for kids is interesting and well liked by the kids i chose jal so because of the super early program which cost me less than usd per pax both ways,3
now i live in moscow and always travel by this company the attention they provide is of very high quality regardless of the kind of seat you have punctuality japanese is something that is very much appreciated in these times and this company knows it perfectly in all my trips i have always had very good experience with the menu you can choose between options and the combinations and flavors are of very good quality and do not forget the appetizers that help you taste meals better in one of my trips my suitcase broke down and when i went to pick it up from the conveyor there was a person from the company waiting for me with the bad news however they gave me at the time a new suitcase with the apologies of the case yes i dont change jal for other,5
after having a terrible experience with qantas flying into osaka we were happy to be on a different airline heading home jal actually exceeded our expectations in regards to their welcome their craft their service and the quality of their food first time ever ive eaten and enjoyed an airline meal in stark contrast to qantas staff nothing was too much trouble and they were constantly up and down the aisles with coffee tea green tea and water upon landing staff were at the baggage carousel offering help and directions to anybody who needed it i highly recommend jal,5
fly with jal for the st time and i really have a great and pleasant journey with their excellent services and also the ontime schedule hope i can have another flight with,4
so i bought a round trip ticket for my girlfriend from mnl to nrt airport with my us credit card she had no problems flying from manila to tokyo but a few days before her return flight jal cancelled her flight they told her i needed to go to the airport in the usa to show them the credit card i used to purchase the tickets not is this a tremendous hassle since the airport is not that close to me but i dont even have enough time to go to the airport now before her return flight back because this is so last minute and i have to work and they also said that they wont issue any refunds for the ticket too i think they should at least refund half the price of the ticket but actually should probably be the full price given the great hassle and inconvenience now she had to buy a different last minute ticket to fly back to the phillipines and that ticket is very expensive,1
love the japanese service quality so polite and helpful great food on board too if there is pyjamas it would be perfect,4
everything was excellent even for the economy class passenger the pillow they provided was just wonderful for supporting your neck whereas the only part i did not like is the windows of the aircraft,5
im not one to write a review unless its incredible or atrocious this experience was the latter this was the first time i flew japan airlines after hearing about their amazing customer service experiences from my friends who live in asia sadly i have to say it was one of the greatest disappointments of my flying experience that ive had my luggage was damaged somewhere from jfk to khh via nrt there was some type of oily liquid that was spilled on my black luggage which i later discovered had seeped into my bag and ruined my clothes japan airlines obviously knew about the spill as my baggage came out onto the baggage claim carousel wrapped in a pink plastic bag i didnt think anything of it since i thought maybe they had covered it due to severe weatherrain it also had a strong foul smelling odor when i took it out of the plastic but again i just thought it may have been the plastic bag felt dry and i couldnt see liquid damage since my bag is black when i got to the hotel i opened my bag to find my belongings soaked and stained in an awful smelling liquid photos and videos were taken immediately i also washed my handbags and clothes as quickly as i could to prevent permanent damage we contacted japan airlines the next day and spoke to their customer service at kaoshiung airport we submitted all my travel documents the baggage tags and boarding pass along with my photos and videos of damages even though they covered my luggage with plastic they are refusing to accept fault the only compensation they are willing to give me is a cheap replacement luggage that doesnt even compare to mine and they refuse to take responsibility for my damaged hand bags and clothes no dry cleaning no allowance for clothing which is frustrating since the majority of what i brought is now ruined and unwearable and no compensation for the inconvenience theyve caused needless to say japan airlines has lost my business i would never fly with them again my biggest regret is that i couldve saved and flown with cathay pacific,1
we purchased an air ticket for my wife to travel to visit family in tokyo japan on jal the ticket was purchased via gotogate travel purchased on for travel beginning on at a cost of approximately unfortunately after booking and upon inspection of her travel document she discovered a typographical error in her first name on the ticket her first name four letters has an extra letter ii instead of i rather than the correct spelling were not sure how this happened and were quite surprised to see it we made repeated attempts to rectify this situation and get the typo corrected we contacted gotogate by phone and email multiple times we contacted jal by phone and email multiple times we drove to the airport in san diego and asked for help at the jal desk we contacted alaska air though our efforts did receive some replies none were satisfactory the typo remains on the ticket given the fact that tsa or the airline may stop her at airport security screening or stop her from boarding the flight she is not willing to use the ticket therefore we have requested a full refund for the amount of the ticket minus an appropriate handling fee so that her booking via go to gate on alaska and jal will available and so that some other passenger may book travel on the seat we believe that the airline and the travel agency have a moral obligation and responsibility to serve customers to the best of their abilities and to rectify this kind of situation moreover both the airline the travel agency and other customers stand to benefit by allowing the seat to be used by another customer we are aware of the airline policies and practices regarding refunds and changes yet we believe certain situations are exceptional and require flexibility at this point all we can do is chalk it up to corporate greed and feel a simmering anger over our loss,1
great flight the entertainment system has dozens of movies and tv shows to watch which make the flight go by quickly the service is exceptional and the food was very good for any flight we flew economy class and had enough leg room their other classes of service looked even better i would absolutely fly jal again when going back to japan,5
japanese airlines is an expensive airline and we would hardly fly them but you can fly cheap even expensive airlines need to play only dates we flew the next day after the world cup in moscow thousands flew from moscow including to tokyo but why fly back the flight by the way was not loaded we didnt buy a ticket on the japanese airlines website but on the s website with which they are in codeshare it turned out cheaper than aeroflot as it is sung in the famous song first of all planes well and girls then as ana its the main competitor the japanese airlines used of been dreamliner we were already flying these planes with nowegian airlines in the united states despite the current skepticism about boeing after two catastrophes with the max the dreamliner is an excellent aircraft with best ergonomics and the notorious smart chameleon portholes now about girls i mean flight attendants they work great smart sensitive in short a role model there is a simple means to conquer air passengers on longhaul flights is to offer metal cutlery i dont know why its so important but it works that on flights on emirates that on japanese airlines the food is excellent breakfast and dinner a sandwich with fruit for lunch the quality of food and star airlines skytrax the food is about the same equally good wine for some reason almost always french if you dont have enough you can ask for another glass the entertainment system is good movies novelties and a little classics games in general hours passed unnoticed the best praise can not come up for longhaul flights,5
ths is my first time using jal and it was amazing from the boarding process service very nice and friendly staff willing to help and fulfill your needs meals are incredible i got salmon creamy for lunch and ice cream when take off from jkt i got two yakult seat ang legroom is soo nicee very convenient even you are travelling in economy,5
a direct flight from melbourne to tokyo the cabin was spotlessly clean ample leg room and the inboard service excellent the dividing partition separating economy class from business class had a window which i believe made the inside of the aircraft appear much more open and spacious my seat number was c and i believe the plane was a b i give this airline my highest recommendationi flew times on my trip with japan airlines and could not fault them in any way,5
loving the experienced at jal feels the japan even before you reach the island best economy seat i ever had,5
good comfortable chairs everything was extremely well organised food was better than average in so far as airline food is concerned toilets clean all the time,4
a very fuss free check in by a lovely member of staff bags were weighed and on their way in no time i dont think it took much more than minutes to be checked in the flight was fully booked but the plane was efficiently loaded and took off on time seats were a little bigger and were great my only thought was i wish they werent synthetic food served was yummy and we were at our destination right on time we would definitely fly with jal again,5
it was such a pleasure to be treat the really good old fashioned way too many airlines have lost their way they were friendly and obliging on the plane the two young ladies who helped us off the plane in our two wheel chairs were so helpful they were patient and strong in handling our four pieces of luggage they helped us through immigration and customs all with a smile they absolutely refused any tip thank you japan airlines i look forward to flying with you again and look forward to recommending you to everyone i wish that i had written down the names of the two wonderful ladies who helped us,5
had the pleasure of returning to japan via jal business class out of jfk checkin was smooth once the attendant realized my baggage wasnt overweight as she confused lbs and kg tsa pre so security was a breeze and they use the lufthansa lounge in terminal different german beers on tap and its never too early right i waited for food for the plane as i knew in business it would be better and was definitly good choice since it was about lunch and i knew i was sleeping immediatly after i went with the western and actually had fish on the plane for first time and was excellent as was the service i had the first window seat behind first class and was really private the way the seats are designed so zero disturbance throughout the flight downsides to the seat are that it gets a bit hot as the port side of the plane gets full sun blasting for about half the flight at altitude and for my cm frame it was just a tiny bit short otherwise everything else was great and will certainly repeat in the future,5
we flew with this airlines twice the first time the flight attendants were rude and inattentive they ran out of chicken and only had pork left maybe it was a mistake on my part to not order a special meal but i thought because they had chicken on the flight which i ordered while booking things would be ok the second flight we ordered a special meal for our year old and they gave it away they tried to give her a replacement meal of unhealthy and snack that consisted of peanuts which she could not eat when we told them no they came back with baby food,2
economy sydney to japan we chose jal for a few reasons daytime flight going over meant we started the trip not tired and everything we needed jr office supermarkets etc were still open plus no delay checking into our hotel the price was very reasonable the flight both ways on time the staff efficient and we were able to move seats on both flights to bulkhead seats movie selection was adequate to a hour flight food ok with reasonable drinks offerings would definitely recommend,4
i flew jal flights tofrom japan premium economy was better than business on other airlines for starters we had lounge access on both ends which was relaxing the seats were roomy and had tons of legroom the aircraft was a which was quiet and felt less claustrophobic than most planes ive flown on the seats reclined in a way where the seat back didnt jam into the person behind you meals were good and there were snacks and drinks available throughout the flight crew was very friendly and happy to do anything to accommodate passengers i was very concerned about what id do for hours on a plane but the flight went by quickly the direct flight from bos to nrt is a fantastic route and seems very popular,5
the business class at japan airlines is much better than economy class the price gap is not as big as expected,4
i dont know whats happening with japan airlines such terrible customer service in the new first class lounge signed up for a shower waited an hour rechecked with attendant and she had not written me down now people in front of me as everyone was arriving for the flight i had the pager but just kept repeating there were people ahead of me no apologies new food service is a step down from the previous first class lounge so disappointing,1
we were travelling overnight from japan to canada which was a challenge in itself mostly i cant fault the flight as staff were accomodating and friendly comfortable environment and flight in time with little turbulence my only considerations when choosing the airline next time would be limited movies challenging menus for western travellers especially children the seats on this flight dont lay right down and for a business class seat there was limited privacy usually this wouldnt worry me but considering the flight is overnight i would prefer to rest without worrying about disturbing the person next to me due to this i didnt sleep at all im not sure i will use this flight again during the hours but for a less fussy traveller the airline provided a great service at a reasonable price,3
we travelled as a group of three from sydney au to narita airport in japan the flight was great especially considering the daylight hours with little turbulence or delays there were a few disappointing issues namely limited movie selection a seat that didnt recline for one of our travellers another didnt have a working usb port and the third had problems pausing the movies when needing to go to bathroom meal times etc however the staff were friendly and tried to fix whatever problems they could all considered we enjoyed our flight and only had a few minor issues with jal,4
this was a very long flight with a hr transit in nrt the xx seating configuration for both planes the b and b made the flights a bit crowded arrived yvr very tired jal want to milk revenues for seats but theyll never achieve superior status they could learn from cx and sq inflight delivery capability id avoid jal but this time i really had no choice because of last minute trip arrangements,3
we had a great flight flying jal everything is great from check in to landing and pick up luggage deffinately will fly with jal again next time,5
check in was very good and quick the seats where good and the choices of moves was a good selection the lunch on our seven hour flight was tasty and a good sized serving leg room was better other airlines we have been on,4
while the cabin is starting to show its age and is not as fancy as the new first class suites that are popping up this product is still amazing the suite itself while doorless is very private i was traveling with a partner and found it quite easy to talk to each other but with the partitions raised i cannot see her at all the seat is roomy and for a foot lb guy i had plenty of space to toss and turn and sleep and jal still provides a mattress pads with the choice of firm or soft the service is top notch the cabin crew were all super friendly and was available immediately as soon as you needed them but at no point did they feel intrusive the food is one of the true highlights of the flight this meal would be great even if it was at a restaurant on the ground my favorite dish was the tuna which was made with fresh high grade otoro it was so good i ordered plates i slept for majority of the flight so i could not try all the food but everything we did have was delicious this f cabin does have the seatbelt on the ottoman which means couples could dine together although it is a little awkward as the person sitting on the ottoman has their back leaning on the tv but other than that it was fun to be able to dine with your significant other on the plane my small gripe is that jal no longer serves dean deluca ice cream in first and now its just haagen daaz which seems too plain for first class imo the amenities kit is now by etro it was loewe last time i flew with jal and for ladies a cdp face mask was given while men got the shiseido grooming kit i opted to get the cdp facemask for myself as well as men can also appreciate a good face mask the pjs offered is now unbranded the old ones had a jal logo i found these new pjs to be much softer than before and are very comfortable they fit big the large actually for me when i am usually a xxl in street clothes overall jal still offers a super amazing first class with good seats great service and amazing food,5
our first trip to japan and this hour flight was the start of our vacation we were in the seat section next to the window near the back of economy class the staff was attentive and kind we had full meals and a small sandwich offered in between no charge for wine served with food the food was pretty good frequent trips were made by the attendants to offer tea water or juice they left pitchers of both in the back of the cabin along with a basket of assorted snacks where you could help yourself there were movies tv programs music and games all available for each seat blankets pillows and eye masks were availablethe plane was clean,5
heard about the great service of japanese airlines and sure was not disappointed with this flight the flight was very well organized from the start of the boarding process to deplaning the only slight flaw was the economy class food was not so great although the japanese beers being offered made up for it also the plane was older so the inflight entertainment system and seat need to be refurbished,4
this was my first experience flying with jal and it wont be the last the services was star even in economy and the level of comfort was great the steward staff were great especially with our kids the food was the best airline food i have tasted in a while even better than some business class meals i have experienced,5
the business class experience was okay overall and the service was very friendly i chose the western menu and it was disastrous the food looked and tasted dated the main dish fish was not properly warmed up and had totally dried up quite frankly it was a disgrace even the coffee was lukewarm and weak not a good experience,2
we travelled to tokyo ex sydney return and the experience was superb crew were attentative food not bad seats were more roomy than others overall a great experience on the return trip i logged on hours before departure and was able to secure the exit row,5
i was dreading the long transpacific flight but the experience was better than many shorter domestic flights in the us spacious comfortable good foodamenities and great service from boarding to deplaning it was a positive experience i might have wished for a better entertainmentmovie selection but thats about the only criticism i can come up with,5
check in only hrs in advance compared to cx hrs can be better business class lounges taipei nariata honolulu not much food variety but you sure will get the beef curry with rice in every jal business lounge on the carbin seating typical business class seating acceptable food only provide western or japanese lack of quantity you have to pick it once you on board otherwise the popular dish will gone and you need to get what is left taste is good well compared to china airlines and asiana airlines similar to korean airline and cathay pacific airlines overall i think jal is good but still has lots of room for improvement,4
i recommend it excellent food excellent drinks excellent attention excellent comfort everything excellent,5
the flight was really good service is great and the flight is very clean economy class is better than most other i have travelled entertainment could be better overall great experience,5
i took a flight from bkk to haneda tokyo round trip jl and jl the online check in was fine and easy the flight was overall good and cabin crew are extremely nice and helpful highly recommended,5
this was a very good minute flight from tokyo hnd to tokushima tks everything met or my expectations especially the wonderful views of the japanese alps and mount fujithe airfare was lower than the only other airline offering nonstop service on this route,4
i know japan airlines is good but it is normally over my price this time i found cheap by internet i picked exist seat so i had very good leg room i know i have to help when i need to by the way it was like lcc need to do check in by machine by myself but very comfortable as usual but it depends on who assist me as usual flight was jta,5
amazing i was well taken care off being a vegan the stewards ensured that my needs were met at all times i really appreciated that,5
excellent service meals and a snack which was a sandwich side and ice cream a meal for me along with great beverage serviceincluding complimentary alcoholic beverages highly recommend,5
i swore off taking jal years ago due to poor service and aging equipment this was the first time i had flown them in over years they have most certainly improved the was clean and the seats were some of the best configured business class of any overwater airline that i flown recentlyand ive flown a few the cabin crew were friendly and professional the food was ok by airline standards but nothing memorable the only downsides were a totally inoperable flight status function in the seat video and a cockroach that had made itself at home next to my seat,4
worst customer service ever booked flight from knoxville to hanoi for sept tried to have me fly to chicago a day early with no place to stay i told them of a connecting flight through dc that would save me this problem they said okay but refused to email me a new itenary told me if i opted for a refund that i had to wait months all this after hour and minutes on hold waiting to take to someone the customer service rep tomie was completely unhelpful and could care less about my flight problems opted for the refund and will go back to flying korean air and ana when i go to hanoi avoid at all costs,1
the most uncomfortable seats in any cabin on any airline my whole body hurt for a week bad food and terrible movie choices two stars not zero only because of the cabin crew,2
this was a better than average jal flight with food prepared in japan much better than incoming flightsit was code shared with finnair as this is a convenienet way to get to europe as finnair provide the next leg into many destinations in europe the entry process was an abomination with two officers asking many questions and taking excessive time to procees people taking care is needed but this was not well done we waited nearly an hour and we were about in line this is totally unaceptable for airlines like jal and finnair who promote helsinki as an entry port to europe this is not new and time for change oficers appear arrogant and not focused on getting legitimate peoplethrough in a timely fashion we were first of a number of flights in from asia and one can imagine the delays that occurred later,4
i flew from tokyo to singapore return in business class the experience was excellent throughout with good food western and japanese selections wine nz sauvignon although the lack of any rum was noticeable i could not find it in the airport duty free or lounge either so i assume rum is not so popular there a standard dnata lounge in singapore but a full jal lounge in tokyo with showers breakfast very comfortable seating good light and low ambient noise on board there was a nice greeting at your seat from the lead stewardess amenity kit slippers a lie flat bed with space although notable on the return leg i found a bit more space with the window seat than the aisle seat in the formation this was the jal skysuite power points privacy good screen and a comfortable lie flat bed i got a good hours sleep on overall a good product i will be very happy to use again,5
japan airlines charges a premium for their business class but i cant see how the experience onboard justifies the higher price the biggest problem is the seats themselves hard uncomfortable narrow not relaxing when sitting upright and hard to sleep in i dont understand why they are so narrow given the huge amount of space devoted to each seat food is substandard the japanese choices are unappetizing for a western appetite and the western options are unimaginative and often not well prepared on the whole the cabin crew is excellent and gracious but it doesnt make up for what is basically a very uncomfortable flight groundside their lounges tend to be overcrowded with slow internet again for the prices they charge it doesnt feel like value,3
supposed to travel from haneda to sydney via beijing on april connecting flight out of beijing was qantas but due to cancellation of the qantas flight we had to stay in tokyo another three nights funds were provided for this by jal returned to narita three days later and we were hosted in the sakura lounge prior to boarding very nice service on board was exemplary polite and attentive excellent catering and good inflight entertainment,4
first time flying jal into san diego the was a newer aircraft with upgraded entertainment system the flight was overall good with the exception of food provided on this flight good leg room and comfortable seats made it better than average customer service both on the ground and in the air was great,4
this was my first time flying with jal and in a aircraft the flight was fine with great customer service and aircrew the one thing i was not too keen on was the food on this fight the leg room was sufficient and the seat was confortable as well,4
flew japan air lines both ways for sfohndsfo in premium economy all of the personnel were immaculate in dress courtesy efficiencythe epitome of professional the checkin counters at both airports do it right they are prompt courteous and treat you in such a special way utilization of the sakura lounge on both ends is a real treat with plentiful snacksfoods drinks and extremely clean lounge the airplane was also very clean with bathrooms extremely clean inflight entertainment system functioned well and plentiful in choices for length of flight it was a very unique welcome treat to be cared for in such an outstanding human manner well worth the time costgo to japan and back with this airline,5
firstly jal is a better service from australia to japan than qantas it is lower cost new aircraft and charming crew and generally much better food an issue with this service which is a good one is the ridiculous departure time of five minutes after midnight obviously cost driven but not good for the customera second observation and a pattern on a number of jal flights is that the food is lower quality depeneding on the route and if it is prepared in japan or the or the country of departure overall still better than the other alternative,3
everything was very prim and proper very efficient and personal interactions very cool they get the job done warmth and personal interactions were second thats ok the food was not catered to an international tasteseemed very japanese which makes sense for this airline,4
very fly from honolulu to tokyo or osaka good service good food and drinks too many fly a day to both destinations from honolulu,5
japan airlines jal flew me from tokyo to beijing knowing i had missed my flight connection as i had brought it up with them three times prior to takeoff landed beijing where i was left without any food and water for hours jal staff wouldnt give any information on what if anything they were doing about organising ongoing flights was left in small transit area with a guard unable to go anywhere and virtually no contact from jal finally flown back to tokyo after hours with no sleep i am an older woman in a wheelchair and was only offered yen about aud to catch train in packed tokyo subway to a hotel no vouchers or money given at all for food for two days while waiting for flight to sydney hotel room was dirty smelly smokers room jal staff at beijing indifferent to my problems and need for food and water staff also aggressive completely unhelpful and unwilling to give any information on what was happening throughout all this time as well as myself there was also a monthold baby who also had special needs and no concern for either of us was shown only got water after hours because i managed to finally convince younger jal staff person to bring some as older man dismissive i have had a number of health problems since as a direct result of the extended period without water and food and the stress caused by the attitude of jal staff,1
recently flew return from melbourne to tokyo check in at melbourne was good except no express pass to get through customs etc as have experienced in the past flight over to tokyo was great with friendly service same as the return flight the only criticism i have and was very dissappointed about is that on top of already big amount you are paying for business class you dont get free wifi in this day and age you would think this would be automatically included i flew with qantas on a domestic flight in economy and it was free japan airlines really need to look in to this especially in business class,4
the flights all left on time the service was excellent the plane was kept clean and tidy the entertainment unit was good with a wide variety of movie options but best of all there was excellent legroom in economy i will fly them again,5
it was my first trip with jal japan airlines having used several airlines before i usually fly economy i found the leg space is the most spacious i have experienced so far much more than qantas and emiratesseats were also very comfortable more than emirates qantas onesthe toilets were always exceptionally clean throughout entire flight flight crew very attentive the only downside i would mention is the breakfast was very poorly however main meal was very good i would still use this airline if i had to fly to japan again,4
jal has to be one of the best operators of the dreamliner planes they just get it right the customer service is excellent and food options is impressive i got to say the japanese always aim for perfection with anything they undertake and jal holds that standards close to heart,4
be aware that certain tickets you purchase through jal web site dont allow you to select your preferred seat seat map is not available for certain tickets and youll find it out after you decide to choose a particular flight you may have to go to airport counter for seat assignment by the way i booked this flight months in advance i find jal web design a bit hard to browse through and frustrating quality of service by flight attendants is excellent and they keep toilets very clean always food is not bad at all ana all nippon airline lets you view seat map always and seems much easier for me to search flights on their web site,3
the flight was on time the service was good and friendly i always get served vegetarian food on flights and this one was by far the worst ie the main meal however i had other little nibbles that were offered with the food,4
highly recommended airline asian customer service is still the best best meal on the air kudos to the management and staff of japan airlines,5
the staffs were very friendly and provided excellent services during the flight time the meals were very good spacious legroom and clean lavatory even the flight time was punctual my only complain was the airline only offered kg baggage compare to kg i used to have,4
great service compared to north american airlines upon boarding the plane we were offered candy and headsets all for a domestic flight the announcements were in both languages and the flight was smooth and pleasant the staff were very friendly and professional the flight was on time and there was a lot of help upon landing to guide you to the right direction,5
the sky suite is perfect for solo traveler a window seat is like a personal suite with ample space for you to enjoy the flight the meals are very delicious i didnt know that you can have such amazing meals on the airplane from savory japanese appetizers to delicious grilled salmon to a variety of items ramen beef don on the ondemand menu the flight attendants are very attentive and polite jal definitely made this hour flight from boston to tokyo quite a pleasant experience,5
except that it was hot and ac seemed to be running on the lowest possible setting besides that flight was just fine,4
i often fly with jal first class from either tokyo to osaka or vice versa and have never been disappointed the service is definitely the best i have experienced the crew are so polite professional and friendly i think our australian national carrier internationaldomestic flight crew should be trained by jal sadly the flight is only minutes but nonetheless you are treated like royalty the meal was delicious plentiful and presented so well that it would even out shine some of the fine dining restaurants that i have eaten at thoroughly recommend jal first class,5
i have been traveling for years for both business and pleasure and all over the world i have flown other international carriers and this is my first time to fly japan airlines i flew premium economy and was pleasantly surprised how much the seats reclined and how great the service was i also enjoyed the japanese food on the airline it was very good im also a fan of foreign film and they had some great little japanese films i will definitely fly them again,5
our second flight with japan airlines and much more enjoyable than our previous overnight flight the cabin staff were all pleasant attentive and service orientated a really excellent and friendly team the cabin was half full with most seats in the centre empty two meals were served during the flight a hot lunch tray after takeoff and udon noodles before arriving in melbourne quite good overall and much better than the overnight snack pack and breakfast we had last flight legroom was very good and the general atmosphere quiet i recommend taking a day flight over flying at night if you can as i found it hard to sleep well overnight in premium economy seats they are quite firm with limited adjustment,4
i dont fly very often but i felt even in economy that the staff did an awesome job i would definitely fly with them again,5
flight was delayed about an hour due to a problem with the entertainment system according to the announcements but we saw them loading cargo into the bay which we think was the real reason for the delay got on board pretty fast after the delay and we were seated and take off without any problems we actually arrived in new york on time the crew was was friendly and helpful hang up jackets got us drinks and blankets etc there was only one served meal on the flight dinner the food was okay with the main course being fish or beef the appetizers were strange but okay after the meal everything has to be ordered with the flight attendant or the remote choices were good from sandwiches noodle rice salad etc they were served until hours before landing luggage got there okay somewhat enjoyable flight will take jal again,4
crew were also kind helpful however this time boarding got delayed a few minutes but the flight was delayed for an hour we were early going to the airport since narita is further than haneda food served during this flight was not good its a good thing there are appetizers since the other two were unpalatable the main dish was just passable was already hungry desserts and drink saved the meal,3
it was my st time to fly withjal it did not disappoint the crew from the ground up to the flight crew were nice helpful the only hitch was during bag drop she crew did not accept a photo of the online boarding pass on my phone even if it has the correct name the qr code so i have to bring out my ipad during boarding i showed the boarding pass photo on my phone the crew was able to scan the qr code without a problem in flight entertainment has enough choices i guess the language barrier led to the adequate food serving with choices of appetizer desserts no need to ask for the passengers choice we boarded on time and flight was on time overall it was a good experience,4
on the trip to japan we flew coach business class on the trip back even in coach jal treated us all with great care attendants walked the aisles with water and snacks throughout the flight meals were tasty bathrooms were kept clean and supplied entertainment selection was broad and contemporary seat pitch was awesome for coach fly jal is all i can say,5
the worst service ever on any business class flight i was traveling with my son who fell asleep promptly on boarding not once did the crew ask if he would like something to eat or drink basically we were ignored for hours seems you have to be a japanese salary man to get served in business class on jal crew did not help with airweave mattress or anything though they assisted japanese passengers very disappointed at the discrimination on this flight,1
i love japan airlines the seats were comfy my friends said it was too hard but i have no complaints my boyfriend manage to live thru economy he said it was pretty good the seats were an inch more than american economy airlines the flight attendants were very friendly we were served two meals and a small snack during our hours flight the food was a bit salty but tasty also several drink services when there were no meals served they set up a snack station where you are welcome to help yourself i was allowed two free bags to check in which is great no one fought for overhear bin space so there were bins that were actually empty in flight entertainment was excellent saw movies that i had been wanting to see fairly new movies were available took a small nap or two and then we arrived im actually looking forward to my next flight to japan with japan airlines,5
jal surprised me with spacious leg room and great service by cabin crew nonstop serving water at least times within duration of hours food and snack was delicious,4
i flew on april from seattle to tokyo and then singapore returning on april on the reverse singaporetokyoseattle route the tokyoseattle route is a new one launched on march business class was totally full on the seattletokyoseattle flights maybe because of the attractive promotional fares that were nearly us less than the equivalent business class fares with ana and singapore airlines sq this review is of the tokyoseattle flight the japanese reputation for efficiency was quickly undermined at check in and at the airports seattle as well as tokyo although tokyo was noticeably slower everything seems to take longer than it should and longer than it does elsewhere in tokyo this was true of both check in and security not because the hand baggage security screening is better or more thorough in narita but just because it all moves slowly i found the language barrier particularly noticeable on the ground and in the air i say this as someone who has regularly flown asian airlines such as singapore airlines cathay pacific china eastern china southern ana this is not a comment that comes from a lack of cultural sensitivity i speak a number of languages and do not expect everyone to speak english but the situation is different when considering international airlines services englishspeaking routes where it can be anticipated that a significant proportion of the customers primarily speak english in this context i found that many perhaps most jal staff have a surprisingly poor command of english and are sometimes incomprehensible despite years of living in asia and working with asians including japanese i found it almost impossible to understand the attendant at the check in desk in tokyo and the flight attendants were barely better the jal flight attendants were all friendly and wellmeaning hospitable and attentive to the point of intrusion the famous japanese service training is certainly evident in the air the food and wine were disappointing for business class in comparison with other airlines serving these routes jal is less good not bad but not as good as others of course the standard is better than a us airline would be nobody is ever going to suggest that united should get an award for its food and wine offerings even in their evershrinking international first class but i recall ana as noticeably better and sq is significantly better on both food and wine as well as on pretty much every other category it was unfortunate that my seat had a broken monitorentertainment screen i was informed of this at check in twice at the gate and twice on board but as the business class was full there was no alternative seat and therefore no solution the compensation offered it was quickly volunteered i did not ask for it was a jal coupon for a discount on a future flight or points for onboard purchases or jal miles these were not much use the first two only apply if one intends to fly again with jal and the third says the miles can only be credited to jals own mileage program not to a program partner and it may take two months for any compensation to be mailed to ones address hours is a long flight with no entertainment available as is standard these days the seat becomes a flat bed i found it hard and uncomfortable at least plenty of very soft pillows are available try getting an extra pillow on united my conclusion try ana instead better still go with sq,4
the comfort of the jal is superior to other carriers s the seat configuration gives the feeling of spaciousness i think i was flying on a newer aircraft as my connecting flight onto hongkong was obvious an older i noticed the difference right away with the color scheme plus the seats didnt seem to be as wide and leg room was less the in flight service was lacking as the flight attendants seldom passed through with water and juice for hydration the past three years ive flown sia and the fas would do the water service about every twenty minutes as with most carriers today the food was mediocre a notch below sia but above the others i chose jal this year for convenience my home to takeoff two hours not having to go to sfo i did have to pay about more to save six or so hours,4
my first time flying to japan and i was a little nervous because of the length the attendants on the flight were so patient kind and attentive the meals were unlike any ive had on other airlines my only downside is that because it is under the same family with american airlines the first layover was not enjoyable as their attendantcustomer service is horrible would highly recommend jal,5
japan airlines operate a quality service their aircraft leave and arrive on time as scheduled their inflight service is always good and a choice of japanese or western food is available,5
service is second to none food is incredible good choice of entertainment and seats were very comfortable thank you japan airlines for a great experience,5
it was our first time using this airline our departure time was delayed airports fault for roughly an hour but we still arrived on time the inflight entertainment kept me occupied during the delay as well as the flight the food was great and i liked how they went around and offered drinks tea mostly every or minutes for free after serving the meals this was all on economy,5
absolutely no complaints leg room seemed greater than other airlinescommunications excellent check in prompt meals less boring,4
our first visit to japan and my chance to fly jal trying to catch the cherry blossom season we caught a night flight to osaka and onward by bus to kyoto this pm flight will transist at haneda with about hrs window to catch the domestic flight which will land at itami jal boost of generous leg room at economy which i found it true but the seats has rather thin cushions all round which made sleeping a bit uncomfortable i would suggest a travel pillow for more comfort light supper beer sake etc are all available to help you sleep better we land at the international terminal at haneda you will have to clear customs retrieve your luggage and check in at the domestic flight counter located in the international terminal then you go to the basement and catch the right bus to the domestic terminal there are types of bus service one goes to where ana uses and the other jal as you can see this process takes time and if your flight is delayed you will need to rush the domestic flight was smooth and i would like to praise the jal ground staff for arranging the next connecting flight for us as ive missed the scheduled flight because i forgot to adjust my watch for the hour time difference the return flight is from osaka kansai also transit haneda this sector is much better as our luggage were automatically transfer to the international flight as the flight from kansai also lands at the haneda domestic terminal you still have to take the bus to the international terminal duration of bus ride is about mins but sometimes due to aircraft movements the tower may halt all vehicles movements overall great flight good experience nice japanese politeness and food,5
a great flight seats with plenty of leg room good on board entertainment and food very good crew very attentive would recommend this airline,5
the service was ok apart from no english language at all for all the announcements which i didnt like also the landing was not the best,3
they have the best service i luv always japanese they are the best but the food was not good,5
i have been japan for traveling with family around days with a fantastic trip everything looks perfect from the trip begins until back to thailand with japan airlines flight jl th jan my family get some problem which is cabin crews responsibility to solve it but when i noticed to japanese cabin crews she cannot deal with this problem and ignore it i feel really badits not because of the problem but the service mind with japanese cabin crew done to me i have been flied with japan airlines for years but customer loyalty will be ended here thanks,1
flew japan airlines from san diego to tokyo and shanghai the service from checkin to landing was first rate the skysuite for the san diegotokyo legs are really roomy in economy class the seat was extra wide and there was plenty of leg room to spare the flight attendants were very attentive and polite even reminding the people in front of you to put the seats upright during meal service the tokyoshanghai legs used older models and the seats were noticeably more narrow with less leg room but the service was still on par with the other leg of the trip the only concerns i had were the cabin being a little warm and the seat pad wearing down after a couple hours in on a hour flight that can become a little uncomfortable other than that i enjoyed my flights and would highly recommend flying with jal,5
often take jal for domestic travel in japan they provide free wifi service during the flight and complimentary drink on the flight the soup is the best choice for the complimentary drinks jal never fails me for their service,4
super roomy on the dreamliner everything was fantastic and the a la carte dining was just great highly recommend their ramen which was just delightful the only knock and its a minor one the amenities kit was a bit substandard compared to what was offered on malaysia airlines probably the last time id ever fly business but i would have no hesitation flying jal in economy,5
have flown prenium economy with a number of airlines jal had so much leg room that i had trouble reaching the foot rest in front this was one of the new aircraft with the shell seats that slide forward when recline not back onto the person behind brilliant trip food good to eat staff pleasant and toilets very clean throught whole trip,5
with their mechanical trouble a flight got hour and mins delay and it was notified only hours prior to the departure not only that because of missing the connection they had to find a flight to sfo which was failed the ground staff had no idea and ended up helping her looking up on sky scanner no way to compensate any of the loss basically paid me yen to change my connection flight after the arrival to sfo and made up all the story after all also told me fk off so they are good at not delayed but once they do they have no idea what to do and no compensation then gets mean hopeless,1
great flight with a very attentive crew premium economy is certainly worth it sufficient legroom confortable seatsvery much on time great staff at checkin in narita and lounge access,5
my main concern on a long haul flight economy is will the seat be comfortable so pleased to report they were in flight entertainment good food good,4
my daughter and i had a very comfortable flight from tokyo in business class we went to the lounge before the flight i didnt eat anything as there was not a wide choice of food the food on the flight was very nice and the service was very good plenty of leg room and the seat was comfortable there were no problems with boarding and disembarking i would fly with jal again if the price was right,4
the service was greateverything was good except the inflight foodit didnt meet my expectationtastelessbut other than that i feel comfortable flying with jalthe wifi service also available in this aircraft skyliner,4
absolutely the best flight ive ever taken the alcohol was free flowing the seats are incredibly comfortable and the service was impeccable hoping jal starts flying to every destination on earth,5
when looking for a good plane trip comfort and service is key japan airlinejal is the best at doing both of this because of their new leg space improvement good service and their great comfort during flights when talking about jal your probably thinking about japan and the flights from my closest airport to japan takes around hours even though sitting down for hours with only little bathroom breaks may sound impossible jal makes it possible by adding more space to your seat and improving the material used for the seats also theyre rated number one in economy class seats on skytrax last of all their service is really good whenever i wanted a drink they would bring it to me without any hassle wherever you go on japan airlines you for sure want to fly it again,5
booked okinawa tokyo flight via opodoede seat allocation prior to check in wasnt available while checking in online no combined seat form my wife an i have been available any more very untypical for a none low cost airline at the baggage drop we had to wait for more than min though only limited opened baggage drop counters we asked again for seats next to each other but only middle seats in rows behind each others were available we took them but didnt get a new boarding pass on to security with another long waiting line while scanning our mobile boarding passes staff told us that these are not valid so we had to wait till a jal agent brought finally paper based boarding passes on the plane no announcement in english just japanese which we found odd not the service we expect from a japanese company,2
the airline was clean and on time which are both major plusses to me i flew premium economy which is definitely worth it if you can afford it there are only two seats next to the window the seats are large with plenty of leg room and there is a tiny divider between you and the person sitting next to you there are also tons of free movie choices food was hit or miss first flight it was delicious second flight not so much expect japanese style food if flying from japan a plus to me,5
recently travelled between heathrow and new chitose via tokyo and return using jal and were very pleased with the experience both the international and internal flights were on time comfortable premium economy economy and the service was both charming and efficient the homeward flight was at two in the morning from tokyo and we were surprised not to be given a light meal before settling for the twelve hour flight snacks were available on request but apart from that we found the floor flight to be very good and as this is a route we use often we will be using jal again the costs too compared very well with other airlines despite it being a popular holiday travel time,4
this is our first time flying direct from san diego to narita and back and there were no better way to do this than with a top notched airlines we have travelled with several world class asian airlines before and jal ranks amongst the best of the best air attendants were friendly and attentive and were prompt to ensure that all our needs were taken care of the flights were super comfortable in the awesome boeing dreamliner and there were sufficient leg room even in economy announcements were made in both japanese and english the touch screen entertainment systems were easy to operate and there were more than sufficient movies from fairly recent ones to oldies to keep all of us entertained the meals were very good and creative and out of the box for one of the meals jal had winners and finalists of the red u chef competition in japan create their in flight meals and they were really delicious and gourmet for another meal they had mos burger a famous japanese burger joint create a burger meal these were arguably the best airlines food i ever had jal will definitely be a top choice airline the next time we fly internationally,5
i have flown with jal to tokyo several times before so i knew what to expect and i am glad to say the standard of their great oeverall service has maintained there are several other options for this route but i didnt think twice before confirming my reservation service was pleasant and attentive and the meal served was just as good as before my only comment is that their inflight entertainment system though adequate could do with an upgrade with more varieties offered,5
for a hours flight it was better than expected there was complimentary food service twice with free drinks alcohol included which i didnt expect it was decent airline food i appreciated the variety of entertainment selections leg room was typical the cabin was warm and i didnt need my courtesy blanket at all bathroom lines were minimal with clear signage to indicate when available flight staff encouraged you to stay buckled up and in your seat but hours is a long time and my swollen ankles were not happy when we landed dont try to bring on more than the allowed number of items,5
the business suites on this flight provided enough comfort and some privacy for this longhaul the attendants were always available to help and after the amazing first meal you are able to order a complete menu of items for the remainder of the flight through the ife controller seats were comfortable and went to lieflat bed mode for an comfortable sleep complete with mattress top pillow and blanket entertainment system was filled with movies and music allinall this made the long flight much easier,5
from counter service to attentive onboard personnel baggage handling entertainment choices and comfort i would fly this airline next time i go to japan baggage allowance pounds max checked bags plus carryon pounds max plus one personal item purse backpack briefcase laptop,4
first time travelling on jal domestic flight from tokyo haneda to nagoya even though it was a short hour flight i could not believe that candies were served on the flight instead of drinks i would expect more from a full service airline,3
good flight was very impressed with the whole crew they were very courteous and responded to anyones requests immediately the aircraft was very clean inside the seat was fairly comfortable as much as can be expected on a nine hour flight with adequate leg room they gave us row which has no window so were quite disappointed by the seat selection given to us when assigned a month before the food was quite good the free wine was an unexpected bonus,5
i was impressed with the comfort of the flight the seats and restroom were spacious and there was plenty of legroom at one point the flight attendants provided toothbrushes with toothpaste in the restroom for anyone wanting to brush their teeth,5
all in all a very pleasant experience service was polite y professional out of the mealsnacks were good dessert almond butterpudding was the best was not impressed by the beef in wine sauce had a taste for gin was not charged for drinks took the edge off flying y allowed me to get about an hour nap on a hr flight this was truly a upscale experience service esp,4
it is a good trip on the flight food is really good and suit my taste during the flight i watched one beautiful anime called natsumes friends book via nihofuncom and my animelist perfect travelling,5
i was very happy during my journey to japan i have to say jal is one of the best airlines to flight around the world they provide you with the ideal supplies drinks foodetc a very comfortable environment you can see movies anime during flight everything was fine,5
ive been travelling across the world and i never had a problem andor we never had a problem about combining luggage trying to save space and our luggage is only at k for people in luggage we even travel from tokyo to hokkaido thru ana and didnt have problem even from manila to tokyo then didnt question us combining luggage in one bagluggage which we are supposed tohave k each we were very rush mins before the plane leaves and they even hold our pass to go thru beacause we have to pay first our flight and then i asked to show me if its in the policy caused back in manila and hokkaido we didnt have that typ of problem and guess what they gave us a japanese printed policy take note i cant read japanese sirmam and no specific words that we cant combine combining this happened in narita airport,3
the staff was outstanding nice attentive and very competent the food was very disappointing and the plane pretty old and not well kept i heard how highly ranked they were and was very underwhelmed,3
it was a very short flight from osaka to sapporo but was comfortable with good sized seats myself being lbs looked like a newer plane as it was very clean staff were very friendly from checkin and on the flight free drinks on the flight but no food they were very attentive and kind travelled with my daughter and they gave her a model plane no problems at all with checked luggage even though we checked in hockey equipment and sticks which are oversized nothing to complain about but it would be good to know that you need to download the jal app before takeoff if you want to use the inflight wifi and watch tv or use the internet,5
it was my first time traveling on japan airlines id always heard of asian carriers attention to customer service hospitality emphasis on detail all of the aforementioned were not only met but exceeded on my first flight aboard jal the boeing dreamliner was immaculate and constantly serviced by the flight attendants throughout the hour journey from tokyo to jakarta the meals were all excellent with options for both japanese and western menus i opted for the japanese menu and was delighted with the options presented so masterfully the opportunity to sleep was afforded with the lie flat herringbone seat of the hours i slept for nearly hours very comfortably the crew was outstanding from boarding to deplaning in jakarta would fly jal again anytime and anywhere they fly,5
business class seats are terribly uncomfortable a nightmare tried every angle with different points of contacts sleep position was the worst ended hours of fighting for comfort with horrible headache and pain through entire body wasnt the only traveler complaining other than the seats food was good and cabin service was very efficient,2
top quality all the way the cubicles are welldesigned the seats easily adjust to any desired level down to lieflat you can get in and out without crawling over anybody there is room for ones belongings the individual tv screens are large the food is excellent on the leg from tokyo to hanoi they even served me a steak exactly the way i like it the amenities include a sleep jacket quite soft and comfortable and slippers as well as the usual items and of course a face mask the many flight attendants on jal are so attentive to our every need,5
love the seating in economy the wife sat next to me was a very good flight on time running at both ends i request wheel chair was provided no problems the only minus was the food very japanese not my taste but others loved it i was cared for very well by crew,5
the new business class cain is excellent with each person having their own mini suite so you dont bother or step over anyone when you need to get out of your seat for any reason their on demand dining works extremely well too,5
booked the tickets for the flight about days in advance to get around off the average roundtrip ticket economy for a direct flight from nyc to tokyo there was a freak snow storm the day of our departure and as soon as i found out the flight was canceled i called jal customer service they were extremely helpful and put me on standby for the next available flight from a different airport since the original flight was not to be rescheduled for a few days later they even managed to get two seats next to each other so amidst the disastrous conditions of having a multiday snow storm almost end my entire trip jal saved the day the flight was delightful which is saying a lot since it was hours lots of movies to choose from attentive flight attendants and comfortable seating i will be booking my next trip to japan with them,5
i was in business class to help accommodate a back injury business class seats on this plane lie completely flat and have a nice area to stash items unless you have the window seat you do not have much privacy the sky suite design has the side of the seat wide open to the aisle i think the center might be preferable to aisle because there is a separate entry area and you have partition walls between seats the food on this flight was horrible the plane seemed very dated and it felt like the air was not able to circulate i was in th row and the smell of the bathroom was evident throughout the entire flight further back seemed better on that front in flight entertainment was a very dated system with few offerings the screens in business are quite large but that meant you were more subject to light from movies watched in other seats despite the partition walls,3
the service was outstanding very attentive crew i purchased business class ticket for lie down seat as i have a back injury the plane was a newer model but the business class seats do not lie flat as described by ticket agent they come close but still have an incline the food was pretty good it leaned toward japanese menu but there were still a few western items on it not much offering in the media area a few movies and strange collection of one or two episodes of tv,4
again a aircraft second time this seemed to be a newer aircraft one could tell buy the carpit wear seats were comfortable and leg room was adequate the service was excellent on this flight all the way from crew and ground personnel food on the aircraft was hot and tasty with the exception for breakfest meal only one choice was not goos at all allinall this was a good flight,4
this is my first time flying on a i booked the flight through american airlines account so this was a code share flight the flight was goodand the service was excellent in every way this was not a new aircraft and the flooring was well used but the aircraft seemed to be well maintained the food was good with three selection available and it tasted good too seating was ok if your are under feet but gets cramped if your over feet,4
no problems with the jal service as expected vert polite service food was good and plentiful flight on time and all else went well bit more expensive than some but would recommend if this is your only trip to japan,5
departure was after midnight and the journey was so smooth the seats so comfortable that i slept for much of the trip the great thing about the premium economy seat apart from its generous width is the fixed back of the seat which does not encroach on the space of the passenger seated behind even when fully reclined my flight attendant did not wake me up for the meal service and only served me breakfast when i requested it at the end of the service how very kind and considerate the meal was light and tasted ok the only downside was the airline lounge at osaka airportitami which was extremely crowded passengers had to go down one level and then up another to access the buffet spread like several other travelers we did not take the trouble to do so,5
i flew on a flight from tokyo to seoul and was treated so kindly by the crew when they served the meal they provided me with a translation of what i was about to eat on a preprinted piece of paper i thought that was so thoughtful obviously safety is number one when flying but on board service always makes the experience so much better jal is an outstanding airline in my opinion looking forward to another flight in the near future with them,5
flight departed on time at pm boarding was orderly and there was a sign to indicate jals boarding priority jal one world elite members board first followed by business class passengers who dont belong to the first group there is no first class service on this flight there is no pretake off beverage service when fas were released from their seats they came by to take meal and beverage orders there is a printed menu laid out on the table during boarding choice of japanese or western meal i chose the japanese meal since the flight was out of japan the seats arranged in a herringbone placement are comfortable however they are not that wide window seats have a little extra space on the triangular tabletop by the window there is not very much storage space for your belongings magazines and instruction cards are placed in very thin pocket on the wall below the tabletop cant put anything thicker than magazines in it items placed on the tabletop are not secured and will slide around during turbulence there is a tiny locker in the wall above the tabletop at shoulder level its triangular space is not very usable and is adequate to store the headsets provided they are over the ear headsets though not noise cancelling i didnt use them amenity kit had eye shields socks and toothbrush of disposable quality had to put my belongings in the foot well to ensure they didnt slide around there is an extendable arm rest on the aisle side it must be retracted stowed during taxi takeoff and landing when extended there is a small storage box below not much use due to triangular shape and unusable when arm rest is required to be stowed movie selection was quite good and includes japanese selections new release movies were adequate though not as extensive as other airlines i was tired and watched only one movie japanese meal was adequate disappointing for something coming from tokyo the starters were served in a flimsy bento box numerous one to two bite items that were tasty main course was served after the bento box was cleared it was disappointing rice served with stir fried beef which was of meager portions and not particularly flavorful dessert was served after table was cleared it was nothing memorable i remember much better meals served before the airline went through reorganization lie flat seat was quite comfortable you have to adjust the lumbar support to make it totally flat otherwise you will feel the bumps despite that i could feel the joints in the seat cushions it needs a bed pad to cover up the joints had to adjust my sleeping position so that my hips would not come in contact with the joints as they were a source of discomfort the blanket was quite thick and i perhaps should have used it as a bed pad fas were attentive when you press the call button surprisingly they did not hand out bottled water at the beginning of the flight i had to ask for it it was supplied on my outbound flight snacks were available on request choice of ramen soba or udon instant noodles nothing terribly exiting and i didnt need it slept the rest of the flight ice cream served as prearrival snack overall the flight and service was good not outstanding,4
it was my first flight with a full fledged airline and i was not disappointed the staff spoke english and seemed to take the time to note which passengers preferred speaking english or japanese i sat next to a japanese lady on my return flight and the attendant switched languages when asking which meal i preferred i found it very impressive the meals were good they made sure to have options one more asian and one more western however the sides always included something japanese i thought it was a great touch sample some lesser known japanese treats while on board they handed out some rice cracker snacks and ice cream the drinks available included some jal exclusive wine which tasted good had a chance to taste both because my bf ordered red and i had white the seats were comfortable they provided a small pillow and blanket very much appreciated it had a wire in the head rest that could be used to stop your head from rolling too far i liked that a lot not sure if thats a standard feature for all full airlines entertainment was good the movies werent too old and being able to see some japanese movies was cool,5
we recently flew from dallas tx to tokyo japan on a flight with jal the flight one way was approx hours we were in the economy class and were concerned we should have upgraded our seats due to the length of the flight to our pleasant surprise our seats were very comfortable able to lean back as well as having a monitor installed in the headrest in front of you stocked with numerous movies tv shows and games to keep you entertained during the flight you were also provided a neck pillow as well as a blanket both items were sealed and located in your seat upon arrival the seats themselves were spacious to be economy and there was plenty of leg room also the overhead bins were spacious and held our carryon sized backpacks easily the flight attendants were very nice and accommodating due to the length of the flight numerous meals snacks and drinks were provided you were given a choice on entree or main dish of some of the meals the food was surprisingly good the food was served accordingly heated dishes remained hot and chilled dishes remained cold upon being served you were also given silverware with each meal the attendants returned promptly to remove items upon completion also the one thing i forgot to pack was my headphones to my surprise the flight attendants came around at the beginning of the flight and asked everyone if they needed a set of earbuds while these were not expensive earbuds they worked perfectly and were conveniently free of charge i have no complaints of our flight to or from japan and would highly recommend jal to anyone,5
the seat were comfortable but did not have any individual entertainment for a the laggage was a little slower that ana but it was still fast,4
compare to sia and qatar jal seats are tighter compared to both amenities are not great compared to qatar service is average compared to both food is average compared with sia transits was rushed n did not enjoy the lounges lots of room for improvement,3
jal is second to none when it comes to customer oriented service they make it priority to make sure customers are comfortable and have a good flight experience the planes are well kept clean and the attendants do their best to keep it that way throughout the flight one of the top airlines available and still doing their best to make it better,5
our family of four had taken jal business class from singapore to haneda airport i was always told jal is one of the best unfortunately quite disappointed by the food and space on the business class they also dont have preflight drink the chair cant lift the individual leg rest and must turn into a bed to raise the leg rest,2
we are expats living in manila and took a family trip to tokyo with our yo daughter the plane was brand new and the crew was so helping and welcoming to our surprise we had to preorder our daughters child meal in advance this is kind of weird as their policy is to even offer toddlers a regular meal unless they are asked differently as if a toddler would eat a regular meal in any case as i had ordered a special meal for me and my husband this option was not an option online i checked more than times with no luck thank god i had some snacks with me but our daughter was really disappointed she did not get the kids cutlery etc,3
we flew jal for our quick trip to nagasaki because of their flight schedules and affordable airfares to nagasaki their service was very pleasant during the short two hour flight their attendants were all smiles and helpful during the whole flight,5
food on the plane was quite bad some kind of pizza with tomato sauce and that was the only option available because the food was so awful i asked for cup noodles and i was told that they only offer cup noodles to premium economh customers cup noodles are not even expensive the worse thing was jal served the same food on the flight back definitely a bad experience and will avoid jal economh flight,2
one of the best airlines ive tried from the moment i stepped into the aircraft i instantly felt its worldclass aura their service is on point from the ground staff assistants and of course flight attendants they were all professional and kind i bought my tickets maybe months or less before my trip to japan i chose economy but it felt like business class what more if i opted for business class the entertainment available during the flight will surely keep you entertained the whole flight their movie selection had recent movies i watched the greatest showman tomb raider a star is born and bohemian rhapsody they also had movies from other countries and japan of course music and other sorts of entertainment was available but wasnt able to really explore them since i was busy watching and eating yes eating the food in jal was really good it was delicious overall jal for me is one of the best decisions i ever made i have already recommended jal to my family and friends and for sure i will fly with jal on my next japan trip,5
this was our first transpacific flight and weve had some less than ideal long haul flights in the past for this trip we decided to splurge and go with jals premium economy the flight actually exceeded expectations the obvious extra room was much appreciated im but the other enhancements such as lounge access expedited baggage handling and enhanced menu offerings also added to the overall experience the jal team both on the ground and cabin crew were top notch professional and friendly i was sort of dreading the hour flight but my fears were quickly dissipated well definitely return to japan and jal will be the first airline we consider,5
great to stay a week and take advantage of the jr tickets relaxing trip to yunomine onsen wonderful foodie stay in tokyo,5
we had an issue where we were trying to bring a lithium ion battery item that was safe for travel through but japans version of tsa said it was unsafe we tried to argue and proved that it was safe off their own website no less but to no avail that isnt the issue here thoughwhen we asked how we could mail it home the japan airlines staff had no clue when we asked what we are supposed to do they shrugged at us and said sorry no idea they are just the airline while we tried to google to figure it out the staff then cracked jokes at us and called us stupid argumentative americans so there was that will not recommend japan airlines or fly them american or any sister airline ever again whole experience was awful and it didnt help that while we were giving up an expensive item that mind you is on the approved list on jals website we got to be made fun of too dont assume we dont know the language,1
my first time traveling outside of the country with my wife for our honeymoon i was a little nervous but the kindness of the flight crew the comfort of the plane the amazing inflight meal all of it made the long hour flight fly by pun intended there were plenty of recently released movies available to help pass the time i watched on the flight there we intend to go back to japan as soon as possible and we will most definitely be flying japan airlines again,5
overall it was a good flight as far as boarding and timing went and general quietness in the cabin i found the seat harder than expected and even maximum adjustment wasnt comfortable so hardly slept i would not consider a flight to europe at this class food was extremely poor snack for overnight after we boarded at around midnight was packet of smiths crisps timtam biscuit small pastry and bottle of water pretty awful offering for a premium economy meal hot breakfast was not at all appetising more like lunch or dinner cant say im looking forward to the return trip,3
i appreciated the touch and go service which negated the need to print any documentation the flight was comfortable and i was surprised there was drink service for such a short flight the seats were comfortable hostesses hospitable and the flight was smooth it felt as if by the time i blinked i was already at haneda the first flight from kix means that you can arrive in tokyo in time for breakfast would definitely use jal again,5
jals service was excellent from san diego airport to inflight service and on to the arrival airport a couple of small issues we were not allowed to purchase tickets for jals lounge and could not upgrade at the airport but we got what we paid for an on time flight with good food and entertainment,4
back forth to japan once a month jal is my all time favorite to travel next time ill try the business class leg room is spacious even in economy im cm and feel so good flying with economy class of japan airlines,5
excellent service food and inflight entertainment the flight attends were friendly and courteous throughout no complaints,5
we did not know what to expect but the economy plus allowed us to fly together with the two seat row instead of the there or four seat row in economy the flight attendants were pleasant and thoughtful and efficient food on airline has improved and is a plus for customersthey did not supply bose headphone fortunately i we had our own charging plugs are available as well as a good selection of entertainment,5
seat was comfortable and good to rest which was quite important for me who was so tired service was good as usual about mealwe can not expect much from inflight meals it is always better to bring your own foods i do not like the too polite announcement i hope crew or captain do not disturb us who are enjoying the inflight entertainment,4
ticket is not the cheapest but theres no changes at all first they said no seat but when i tried for a new booking theres some seat then they ended up said my ticket can not be changed at all its the rules ans regulation that they dont show previously not reccomended at all,1
this was my second rount trip flight with japan airlines from san diego to asia flying in and out san diego instead of lax or sfo is convinient no la traffic and less time processing thru customs and immigration though the airline fare is mnore expensive thanfluing in and out of lax the checking counterstaff in san diego and manila were so accomodating thje flight itself left on time our flight attendants were friendly and attentive food selection is okey i wish there more westernise choice public announcements were little bit long because they were announced in japanese and english wish they annouce it in english first the plane was clean on all flighs the legrooms between tokyo and san diego were little cramped compared to tokyo and manila flights overall great service on time flights and short layover between connecting flights,4
a great airline with plenty of leg room my husband and i flew from haneda airport injapan to dubai on an hour flight and it was a comfortable flight plenty of onboard entertainment food good and friendly and helpful air crew,5
right from the staff at check in at tokyo airport we had an excellent experience on japan airlines the staff in the flight were always going up and down the isles serving water and juice frequently the food and snacks were very good and the beverage service was also very good we also enjoyed the inflight entertainment and the selection was very good this was the first time in many years that i can recollect the seats were very comfortable and the leg space for a tall person like myself was more than adequate even in economy class i would strongly recommend that if you have the opportunity to use this airlines then you will not regret,4
food not only looks good but tastes good too great service for economy class comparable to business class comfortable clean and wellmaintained punctual great quality at a reasonable cost,5
we recently made our third return flight from melbourne to tokyo using jal in the last months this experiance was as good as the last with excellent service on time departure and arrival spotless and modern aircraft and very enjoyable vegetarian meals the economy seats are comfortable and the leg room is much better than most other carriers the flights are as enjoyable as any hour flight could be,5
check in at frankfurt was nice and easy checked out the sakura lounge which is well stocked with snacks drinks and everything else youd expect from an airline lounge the lounge is however very small and is also used by almost every other oneworld alliance member so finding a seat was challenging staff were excellent though boarding was smooth the seats are pretty nice with everyone in business class getting aisle access the footrest area is wider than some other business class products but i noticed that in lieflat mode it was a tight fit and im only a shade under a small glass of champagne was served in a plastic glass it really was two gulps worth and was a little bit underwhelming a hot towel was given and then takeoff procedures started once in the air the staff came to take drink and dinner orders the menu was in japanese german and english the fas english wasnt great and she kept trying to refer me to the german menu despite me wanting to turn the page to the english menu at the back we went back and forth on this for a while until she realized that she had made a mistake and that the english menu page was not the prelanding menu i ordered a german chardonnay which was very nice and the western meal like ana jal have a japanese or western option im not a huge fan of simple binary options like this because they do tend to bevery simple not being a fan of japanese cuisine i had to choose the western option which like the japanese option was very seafood heavy which is something i struggle to eat the first two courses were a shrimp and corn potage amuse bouchée followed by a raw salmon and quail egg entree i can handle shrimp but the singular shrimp was a bit dry the corn potage just wasnt my thing since i cant stand salmon in any form or quail eggs for that matter i asked the flight attendant if i could skip that course after explaining that i couldnt eat that she agreed i guess it wouldve been nice to have been offered anything as an alternative but there were some nice german breads served so it wasnt too bad a few minutes later my entree of salmon and quail eggs was delivered to me anyway later the flight attendant remembered that i didnt want this and cleared my table and delivered the main course veal straight away the veal fillet was very nice again quite small with only a token slice of red and yellow pepper the desert was a small slice of chocolate and raspberry cake again very small but very nice all in all dinner tasted very nice but i felt like i hadnt eaten much at all i was pretty tired and just went to sleep soon after staff lay out a mattress for sleeping and it was pretty comfy i got about and a half hours light sleep the on demand service meant that the cabin was quite busy and noisy all night though so i was waking up quite a bit throughout the night breakfast was scheduled shortly after i woke up and again it was a japanese or western option the western option this time was an omelette and sausage with a crossaint jam and some yogurt the omelette and sausage was pretty bland and again quite small the single croissant and jam were nothing to write home about and the yogurt was a tiny cup with two desert spoons full of plain yogurt with a little bit of fruit syrup for taste nothing special at all and i can honestly say ive had better economy class breakfasts than this all in all a pleasant experience that neither disappointed nor stood out i thought the food was okay but the servings were very small i think the lack of choice that japanese carriers offer is a big sticking point for me japanese carriers are very one size fits all in their approach to dining if you dont like japanese food then you only have one other option and if you dont like whats offered in that youre out of luck my time living in japan has taught me that japanese customers tend to enjoy fancy branding and products the menu was proudly advertised as being designed by award winning japanese chefs and this is a great selling point for the average japanese customer on the other hand nonjapanese tend to be not so concerned with branding and image for me i like options and neither jal or ana are very good in that respect staff were pleasant but were just there again its what ive come to expect in japan they were very good at their prescribed job and only performed the minimal level of service but were a bit cold and impersonal there were no personal greetings or farewells and they didnt call you by name i find its little touches like this that really make a business class experience for me my business class flight on thai a few months back was good for this staff knew your name and came to check on you regularly even air new zealands premium economy had a far more personal level of service than jals business class jal lacked that little something extra here inflight entertainment was pretty good overall and the large screen was very nice controls were a little slow but nothing unusual id give jal a out of ten on this flight a good base level product but it did feel like bare bones service,3
japan airlines is first class all the way the flight attendants were professional and respectful the meals served were excellent quality and the video and audio entertainment was top notch,5
my first trip to asia can only compare to flying to europe it was truly a dreamliner it was a quiet smooth flight very impressive first rate movies for a hour nonstop trip watched coming home service was fine would take a again if i had a choice i wanted to pick my seats ahead of time but because i bought on hopper the airlines refused though we needed to sit in the middle section it is only seats across and there was an empty seat beside me,5
first time flying with jal service was excellent and food was nice easy check in service definitely recommend them,5
seat is great and inflight screen good but the food very poor quality luke warm not great staff are of course really great check in was good but even with gold card no fast track through security at haneda,3
i had an early morning flight on jal from singapore to narita i arrived at changi airport terminal around am for my am flight the terminal operates a premier check in lounge for business classfirst class passengers for multiple airlines located behind row instead of the jal regular check in at row i had a connecting flight at narita on jal on a separate booking but after a phone call to check with jal staff at the premier check in lounge were able to confirm they can check me in for both flights there were probably or check in stations in the premier check in lounge of which only about were in use so there was no wait to check in but i found check in staff was a little slow in checking me in probably because they check in for multiple airlines rather than being dedicated staff for jal as i am used to for jal flights the lounge leads directly into passport control security check is at the gate and i was quickly into the dnata terminal lounge which jal uses at singapore jal does not have its own lounge and so uses the third party dnata lounge which also serves a number of other airlines the lounge had lots of seating and a fairly wide selection of hot and cold food for breakfast including chinese shrimp dumplings and bbq pork buns fried vermicelli noodle sausages and egg three kinds of sandwiches etc i tried the bbq pork bun and the vermicelli noodle and both were a bit hard and dried out probably having sat out too long on a brighter note though the lounge had a barista making specialty coffees to order and it was pretty good wifi was inconsistent in the lounge i kept losing the signal and often found it easier to connect to the internet on the changi airport free wifi rather than on the dnata lounge wifi i went to the gate a bit early as security check was conducted at the gate but there was not much of a line up and security check was quick there was a slight delay to boarding at am instead of the scheduled am due to aircraft cabin preparation and pushback was also a bit late at am instead of the scheduled am but we made up the time in flight and landed at pm ahead of scheduled arrival at pm perhaps because of the slightly early arrival i was slightly disappointed to discover that on arrival we had a remote stand and had to walk down the stairs to buses to take us to the terminal i was connecting to another jal flight and had lots of time to connect so the slight additional delay on arrival was not a concern for me the flight was operated using a b aircraft fitted out with the sky suite iii fully flatbed seat in business class each seat had direct aisle access in a configuration i found the seat to be quite comfortable but rather inflexible in operation table lifted up and angled toward you but difficult to use except in fully upright seat position seat recline button covers entire recline function with no separate button for top of seat and leg rest so one could not for example raise the legrest in an upright seat position in flight meal was excellent as usual i selected the japanese meal as they always seem more substantial and more interesting than the western meal options service is as always courteous and excellent and the washrooms were maintained in a very good condition by constant cleaning by the flight attendants all in all a very pleasant flight,5
narita airport has got to be one of the busiest airports around great food lounges and shops but jal sakura lounge has got to be the best ever the food customer service accommodations and the smiles are amazing all attendants provided the special care personal service so very thankful for the experience,5
checking in to take off everything was exceptional impeccable friendly service from the checkin attendant to the flight attendants nothing but smiles and great personal service their conversations and smiles made me feel comfortable relaxed and special this had to be one of the best flights ever for me thank you jal,5
the cabin crew is always impeccably neat and very courteous as the legendary japanese culture is known for the food has improved and better the aircraft is very clean the pilot knew how to land smoothly overall jal makes you feel important as a human being and not as a revenue cash cow,5
flew over the arctic they have it down they dim the cabin so you slept earlier and adjust to the time zone with the least amount of stress food was great service impeccable i will always take this flight to narita going forward,4
flying out of haneda to singapore i arrive quite early around am for my am flight using first class check in and priority security line i was quickly into the jal first class lounge at haneda at around am the lounge was very busy and almost all the tables and seats in the dining area were occupied but most had cleared out by around am food offerings for breakfast were fairly standard sausages eggs hash brown grilled mackerel two soups lobster soup potato an scallop soup there was a chef making pancakes with strawberry or caramel sauce to order set up decor and food offerings were pretty much the same as the first class lounge in narita however one area where haneda clearly has the lead is in the washrooms in the mens toilet twice as many toilet stalls as narita first class lounge for a similar sized lounge the flight to singapore was operated using a b equipped with jals top level sky suite iii fully flatbed seats with direct aisle access from each seat in a configuration the seat is quite comfortable and has a small side locker to store the headsets and other small items the table is a bit awkward as you pull it up and swing it towards you but there is not a lot of flexibility in how to position it similarly the seat simply reclines back down to a bed or straightens back up to an upright seat and there is no option to individually control the seat back and the leg support portion of the seat ie you cannot raise the leg support without reclining also once the seat is partially reclined it is very difficult to get out of the seat so you have to raise the seat back almost to fully upright position before you can easily get up and go out similarly the table does not work well if the seat is reclined so you pretty much have to have the seat fully upright to use the table for eating there is a fixed armrest on one side of the seat that does not move so when you recline to a fully flat bed you actually have to fit your arm under the fixed armrest in the space between it and the seatbed because of this i found the seat a bit narrow when in a bed configuration but there was plenty of length shortly after take off we were served drinks and lunch as usual food offerings on jal are delicious and visually appealing having had many japanese meals on jal recently and seeing an interesting western offering i opted for the western meal with wagyu beef sirloin steak with foie gras sauce with a bit of oxtail on the side the beef was very tender and the oxtail wonderfully stewed and flavourful the starter was interesting too moroccan style abalone salad prior to landing chinese rice dumplings were offered this is literally a ball of rice wrapped in leaves and steamed so not much of a snack therefore i opted to also have one of the instant noodles with udon soba or shrimp flavoured noodle on offer service as always on jal was courteous and excellent no airlines flight attendants are as meticulous about cleaning out its toilets as frequently our flight arrived a bit early but as it was still around pmlate afternoon passport control on arrivals was very busy the lineups for passport control basically occupied the whole of the arrivals lobby and backed up almost to the escalators leading down to the arrivals lobby it took about minutes to get through passport control and by the time i arrived at my hotel on orchard road by taxi it was about hours after landing the jal flight to singapore was very comfortable with excellent food and service,5
i traveled to nyc from sydney in business class and it was a wonderful experience their planes have aisle access from window seats so if you fly solo you can enjoy and view outside without bothering anyone when you want to get up the seem to serve a full meal shortly after takeoff and everything after that is on demand using a touch screen to order food and drinks solves any potential language barriers and i found the service to be extremely fast polite and professional my fellow travelers were also very quiet and courteous which i very much enjoyed food was amazing i stuck with the japanese options and was in heaven,5
the best thing was the crew the food service might be slow but come with friendly and attentive service great portion and variety of food inflight the boeing was new and the ife run smoothly and offering great price for wifi service,5
they would not serve single female travelers in business with drinks i rang the button twice and finally walked up to the galley where they ignored me until i tried to pour my own drink they yelled at me in japanese the lie flat bed does lie flat but it is narrow and very hard they were late for some reason and some safety announcements were not in english although over half the flight was americans or brits boarding was chaotic at best and food was not edible,2
jal is a cheap very big airline in japan it has a seat capacity of more than passengers jal has wifi connectivity inside the aeroplane you can use the wifi connectivity for multi media uses they have class system in all airlines of japan ie upper class membership card vip membership card platinum membership class etc for local citizens those who are frequent flyers the meals are also very good that is served on jal there is also the facility of hindu meal in jal and there many movies one can watch including hindi movies and also cartoons for children and animated movies for them inside the airline there is also one guide tour of japans sight seeing channel and it is a must watch channel for those who are visting japan for the first time which it is a well known airline in japan i would give a star rating for jal,5
be careful how you book if you are traveling with a friend if you book through any site other than their own you will not be able to choose a seat it will be assigned on check in if the plane is anywhere near full you will be guaranteed to be separated and each will have a middle seat somewhere on the plane research before you book,4
not the airlines fault but the flight began with the passenger next to me having an emotional breakdown and screaming just after take off thankfully the flight crew did a great job calming her down and she was fairly docile rest of flight the flight was good overall business class has fold down flat seats and large personal tv monitors you get a complimentary overnight bag a pillow blanket and can also add a foam cushion to sleep on thought the food was just ok tried japanese option on way to japan and western option on way back the sea bass on japanese option and steak on western option were the best items just felt overall that the service was not as prompt as it is on american run flights like delta and american all in all was a comfortable flight,4
as the title suggests worst customer service experience my partner and i are travelling to japan for our honeymoon and have been told we cannot sit together we are on our honeymoon and i am pregnant was told by the airline that the seats are blocked out and not yet allocated but still they cant make arrangements nobody replys to my emails and when you sit on hold for over an hour youre lucky to get to speak to someone when you do the customer service rep offers no service what so ever we havent even flown yet and still the customer service is terrible will never book with jal again,1
this is the first time i go to japan and fly with japan airlines two thumbs up for the pilot because of the plane fly very smooth especially when landing the crews are very very polite and helpful even for passengers in economy class the service makes me feel very comfortable enjoy the meal and beverage very much youll never feel hungry in this flight next time i come to japan ill fly with japan airlines,5
for long flights i always fly first class or business class the extra cost involved is well worth the comfort of the flight,5
not at all like a usa domestic carrier this airline actually cares and takes pride in their service they smile they pamper you and do the upgrade to premium economy for a hour flight food was outstanding for real usa carrier crew face would crack if they tried to smile,5
flew san to sin via nrt on jl a nd jl on nov although jl is the older shell flat seats i did find it to be very comfortable and the jal service was absolutely perfect although flight departed almost an hour later the team went to each individual guests and apologize for the delay and assured the flight will be on time the flight landed on time the in flight meals were fantastic and the crew including jean seki and takao were very hospitable,5
certainly going from nyc to hanoi via tokyo is a long trip so be prepared however an airline can make or break the experience we left jfk on time and arrived to narita international airport about early excellent service especially from reith one of the many flight attendants who took excellent care of us premium economy is worth the extra money but realistically after hrs few things are still comfortable our flight from narita to hanoi was also excellent lounge service at jfk alitalias for some reason while dated think s was clean and offered snacks and drinks the lounge in tokyo sakura was fantastic and very efficient offered buffetstyle meals snacks and drinks great experience,5
it is rewarding when things just work the way they are meant to work and thats how i felt about my flight it was delightful in all aspects seats food service everything just worked well without any any issues or complaints top class itll be my new fav airline from now on,5
compared to economy class of other flights ie british airways our return flight the leg room was more than sufficient the food quality was great on board no difficulty with check in we were within the weight limit on board wifi was utilised though this was rather slow in flight entertainment was ok with a selection of recent movies the customer service was pleasant overall flight seemed to be pleasant and comfortable,4
recently flew with jal from tokyo to vancouver in business class this was an overnight flight the check in was very easy and all staff members were friendly and helpful language was not an issue the sakura lounge located about mins walk from the gate was large and had a selection of food and drinks available the lounge was clean and tidy and a good place to rest before the flight onboard the staff were very friendly and helpful and i quickly settled in i was surprised that business class is using an old side by side seat layout it is good if you are wanting to conduct business or as a couple but if you are sleeping you had to climb over the person next to you to go to the bathroom the seats turned into a bed although it wasnt a flat bed and you slept on an angle i found this annoying as there are other competitors who offer lie flat beds in their business class this was an overnight flight and i was looking forward to a good rest the food and drinks selection offered both japanese and alternate selections both meals were delicious there was a snack bar near the rear of the section where passengers could choose what they wanted there was also minimeals that the attendants could prepare for if required the entertainment was good with a selection of movies both new releases and old favourites the inflight progress maps were limited and i was surprised that there wasnt an external camera to view the takeoff or landing maybe this model of b didnt have such cameras overall the flight was smooth and the staff very helpful friendly and welcoming,4
booked a codeshare garuda flight operated by jal because it was the lowest and our corporate booking tool only books the lowest fare so of course since the flight is actually operated by jal garuda airlines is basically useless after taking the money so after i had to check in online at the jal website with my eticket number since the garuda booking reference connects to nothing i conclude my business in jakarta and head to the airport to do some work in the lounge before my flight since it was a codeshare flight i was not able to get a boarding pass online well apparently jal cannot be bothered with having a person or a kiosk to print a simple boarding pass after i finally walked to various counters and kiosks i called jal customer service and was informed there are no kiosk for jal at cgk and a person would not be there until hours before the flights departure time so here i sit for the next hours on the checkin side of the airport where its hot humid and theres no where to even plug in not to mention im here with hundreds of people trying share limited seating at least i had some time to type out this review shame on you jal how hard would it be for kiosk to print a lousy boarding pass,2
hours flying time seat placement for flat bed seats is not really in ideal angle it is a bit uncomfortable but service and on time departure and arrival is great and a reason to fly from tokyo to honolulu is cathay pacific or thai air do not fly to honolulu hawaii us territory,4
such wonderful service i will never fly another airline when i have an option for jal they have me for life,5
i flew jal in feb from lax to manila rt i am impressed by their courteousness i travelled with elderly mother and they were very accommodating and respectful with everyone especially the elderly in flight entertainment with movies and music food was good i would highly recommend them,5
its just a very short transit flight however the counter staff seem have no information regards international flight and domestic flight trying to push us to pay for over weight luggage i have explained to her we just came from hk an international flight and we are not overweight of our luggage as we have kg allowance not kg she kept on asking for ticket and not accepting my eticket nowadays who will have paper ticket with them and not eticket how could i give her a paper form even i dont use any paper ticket in last ten years anyway i guess as all the good experienced travel to japan and with japanese people i think just a disappointment that someone sit in the counter service will have that attitude in the flight is fine nice smooth trip staff are nice and professional too,3
i havent flown the arabian airlines that advertise how awesome they are all the time but this airline that doesnt advertise everywhere is awesome the difference between them and airlines in the us is staggering the attendants care the food is good we flew in premium economy which is a touch better than economy but my son and i walked through the back part on a few laps and it looked comfortable but the best ever was the service my gosh they actually cared so different from the us i will fly these guys whenever i go to asia in the future,5
we fly quite regularly to australia and now choose to fly via japan it is a fascinating country and we spend three or four days intokyo or kyoto to break up the journey it also really helps to avoid jet lag flying jal has been a real bonus they are considerably cheaper than ba and qantas but service and comfort are superior service from cabin crew is exquisite and charming and the food is exceptional i sleep much better on jal than other airlines and i wonder whether they circulate air more generously so far they have always arrived on time my only minor quibble is that their films are not quite so good but i rarely watch in any case,5
it was very fairly a premium economy experience the seat was as comfortable as one could get without actually laying down the amenities were just fine the food thoughvery typical of the japanese to have delicious food even on their airplanes it was so good flights left on time and there were no hiccupsuntil i got to hanoi and my bag didnt arrive with me fortunately jal is part of an airline group that easily tracks bags within their network my bag was delivered to my hotel promptly the next evening even with that i give them five stars,5
the boeing st class is very spacious privacy is very good when the screen is up not a problem for window seatsif you like japanese food than you have good choices the attendant even make bed for you if you need to sleepthe entertainment system should be good though i didnt try it,5
check in was quick and well organized they have a wonderful system to get the largest crowd quickly checked in the line was long but keep steadily moving so there wasnt a concern about missing your flight i love that they allow you to check one to two bags for free depending on your destination my new preferred airline for travelling asia,5
outstanding service and quality standards the staff courteous smiling and efficient the seats are spacious,5
the politeness friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew is commendable excellent service food is also really good nothing to complain,5
this review is about booking on their website not the flight i learned the hard way after booking on their website to save a few dollars less than expedia ive decided to book on their website and made a mistake of typing my last name as my first and first as my last name this mistake cost me an extra for reissuance of ticket even though i paid for the ticket on the same website jal their system did not intuitively see that im the same person with same address im just used to better ai employed by most us companies just book on known travel websites we have better protection and complaints are heard without slapping penalty for mundane incidents,1
we bought jal air tickets to and fro trip for our family trip this time they do provide child meal looks appetising but not tasty at all their speciality drink kiwi drink was well received at least by my family unlike sq flights they do not have earphones which are catered to children just one standard adult size also on my returning flight i have asked my husband who was seated at the aisle seat to inform the air stewardess that not to open the small bottle of red wine first as i want to have it later after my dinner it was ignored and that air stewardess still give us an unhappy look in comparison the flight from singapore to japan was more pleasant and approachable even though not all the flight attendants spoke good fluent english the return flight attendants were more fluent in english if asked me to choose if my budget allows i will take sq flights or try out ana for future japan trips or better still try out premium economy or business or first class of jal and compare if there is any difference in the treatment by the staff,3
there is nothing to complaint about their on board services attendance are professional caring polite and patient in handling passenger need it was a great experience flying with jal the only thing i would suggest them to improve in providing halal food for muslim personally i did write a remarks during purchase the flight ticket and i guess it was not put enough attention to the crew and the team who preparing it they did serve nonhalal to us which we have to asked and there is no replacement to it except salad overall its a good experience flying with jal,4
it was my second trip to asia and first time to use premium economy seat from checkin premium economy was separate from other class and checkin procedure was quick without waiting in flight there are many goods such as mask and slippers small pillow and blanket quality of inflight item is closer to that of business class although foods and beverages are almost the same from economy class overall satisfaction was good if there is another chance i would choice preimum economy,5
service from start to finish great food more leg space than american airlines upgraded seats boarding and take off from osaka was so fast i didnt even realize that the doors were closed,5
the japan airline is good the seats are bigger room for leg space and the food is wide range except my boyfriend who was flying from boston with japan airline to singapore feedback that the meals are limited and not multiple with snacks on the long flight basically i flew back from haneda to singapore the flight was good as the friendly ground staff was very understanding and provide me with a seat after the premier range of passenger seats i have alot more rooms for my long legs to be stretched my meals in the flight was well done with good presentation and the food was still hot when serve the only issue will be the snack should be like a warm chicken or tuna wrap instead of the bread,5
the flight crew on japan airlines is like no other i have ever experienced all of the attendants were professional caring friendly patient and accommodating it was the best experience i have ever had on any airlines nothing seems to rattle this crew and they communicate in a very genuine manner by making eye contact and speaking to passengers at their level the food water snacks and refreshments were tasty and plentiful we even were served my favorite ice cream for dessert i am now a happy customer for life oh and i even was able to watch several current movies on my flight,5
meals is delicious service is great staff is very tactful when they serve their meal or dessert they make sure every passenger is being address dessert was haggen dazz,5
travelled jal from beijing to haneda and the flight was fine the service was attentive and friendly traveling in business class in a slightly dated arrangement only complaint is there was no welcome drink before takeoff otherwise great service and highly recommended,4
a perfect flight from singapore to tokyo great cabin with superb space for economy flights and a great screen for entertainment food and service was good too highly recommended airlines,5
wide seats good seat pitch and great service at reception and in the air seating is as good as many premium economy of other airlineseven take your oversize luggage ie skis and process them for travel,5
pleasant flight with friendly and helpful crew i thought the the food was good for airplane food when compared to other airlines,5
we recently flew jal from vancouver to tokyo and had a wonderful experience it was the first time foe the three of us to fly with jal and to fly on dream liner as well the service before during and upon arrival was excellent the flight attendants were very pheasants and gave every impression that they loved their job the service was very good and their attention to derail regarding my msg allergy was awesome the flight was long but it was a pleasure with this airline would highly recommend jal,5
the night before our flight and without any notice jal changed plane configuration both our travel agent and we tried to get us back to adjoining seats we tried at checkin and we tried on the plane we even asked single flyers if they might switch i wont go in to that so we ended up paying for business class on a flight where we were separated by rows and i have a flying phobia oh so sorry,3
i flew jal round trip nrtkhh as part of my trip from orlando to kaohsiung jal service is impeccable the flight staff were professional and courteous the seats were human sized unlike the american flagged carriers who keep shrinking seat and pitch and very comfortable the economy meal was amazing even came with miso soup blankets are offered to all in economy,5
excellent with newer planes very pleasant flight just sit and relax and enjoy the food very good overall i felt safe in flight,5
this airline was wonderful the airline staff was outstanding the flights were always on time and the lounges were great from the ticketing agents to the stewards and stewardesses it made a very long flight comfortable and relaxing would definitely fly this airline in the future,5
this is the second time ive traveled with jal and it is amazing how the flight attendants go out of their way to comfort you on my return flight i had even received a birthday card and a replica of the plane since my birthday was the next day in general this is the best airline ive flown by far they make economy class feel like the business class of other reputable airlines i would definitely recommend jal especially for long international flights their service is top of the line,5
great people clean and newer airplane superior service and just a fabulous experience lots of movies and the food was fantastic i will fly jal again when i return to japan highly recommended and when you are in takiyama visit the sukyo mahikari center for light,5
the flight was great and unlike other airlines the sleeper seats were easy to get in and out of the return trip was delayed and we were afraid of missing our one toon but they called ahead and rushed us thru security and waited u til we arrived,5
even in the cheap seats the service the room the entertainment and food were on point with very comfortable and spacious seats even a nine hour flight is not that bad the movie selection and also the food snacks and drinks were delicious the flight attendants were very polite and helpful,5
jal have the best economy class going and their premium economy is also good but with reservations for a start it was a night flight taking off at am and there was no food for the first eight hours although snacks and drinks were available i suspect many would have preferred more choice about this the seats were comfortable but you were locked into a a rigid space you cant move the arm rests and as i was traveling with a young daughter it was not what we wanted she had to sleep separate from me and it was hard for me to move as i slept economy was better in that respect otherwise all was good although the food when it did come was hardly spectacular,5
my wife boys and i flew nonstop roundtrip boston to tokyo this february in economy and can only say great things about this airline the staff went above and beyond really catered to our kids to make a hour flight go by fast and comfortable i highly recommend this airline,5
great flight heaps of leg room good food and friendly staffwould definitly us again and highly reccommend,5
i felt the difference from checking in everyone is so attentive as an american customer who is used to lower level services i greatly appreciated these ladies who went beyond means to serve the customers i especially am grateful of how they treat kids families got on board first with the top paid customers kids always got their meals first and most of all these ladies will always serve with smiles thank you jal,5
all the crew members paid attention to the passengers so that we could enjoy the flight they make a good group and give the service of good quality even though we had no meals economy class from osaka to okinawa at the airport their check in service was speedy and helpful,4
at about five and a half hours this is an in between time flight not short not long one odd feature jals frequent travellers are boarded before business class passengers good news is that it is long enough to get an hour or two of sleep after lunch you might need that sleep as the crew give you huge glasses of champagne and wine the champagne a grand marque the whites were adventurous but the bordeaux was superb crew were friendly and very helpful however failed to bring drinks or water before takeoff unless asked lunch was excellent before landing hot towels refreshments and ice cream were served jal japanese shirts were offered to passengers the aircraft was well maintained but the lie flat seating a bit older as is common with this length of flight as this is a japanese flight the toilets were pristine and the wc had all the toys you would expect from japan on time arrival and haneda is a lovely airport smaller and friendly and easy to negotiate around,4
a wonderful way to end my trip to japan wish i had flown them both ways the attendants were polite and caring the food was far above most airline food and it was just a great experience,5
we flew on japan airlines from san francisco to tokyo and then to bangkok and back and it was a very pleasant experience the flight was comfortable and the customer service was excellent,5
i took a domestic flight from tokyohaneda to okinawanaha japan airlines has class j the seat is available with only yen approx usd surcharge and unlike economy plus of many airlines they offer full business class size seat with wide seat pitch the service is the same with the economy class but you do not need services for hours domestic flight having extra space and comfort with only usd additional is a great value for those who travel frequently within japan regardless of travel class of the ticket if seats are available at the airport you can upgrade by paying the surcharge very good value for money,4
whenever possible i will always choose jal the staff were extremely polite exceeding all my expectations they were prompt and so kind the food was amazing warm fresh and just overall amazing the seats were comfy and i loved the hot towels before meals our own pillows and blankets overall a,5
small uncomfortable and extremely lousy food not really edible sad because i love japanese food the movie selection was terrible i would not fly with jal again there are many options for the same cost,2
i took a very early morning flight on japan airlines at am from nagoya chubu international to tokyo haneda i chose to fly as booked more than a month in advance it was cheaper to fly than to take the train for early arrival at the airport the train was the only option as the limousine bus does not operate early enough i took the first limited express from nagoya station at am which arrived at at nagoya airport the train was completely full since it was the first fast train of the day to the airport on arrival at the airport it was a short and wellsigned walk to the domestic checkin again as it was the start of the flights for the morning there were lineups at every checkin counter for economy business and first class i used the first class check in based on one world emerald status and after a short wait for the or so guests in front of me was met with the usual friendly courteous jal service as it was a domestic flight no japan airlines own brand sakura lounge was available and instead jal offered the centrair domestic lounge a third party operated lounge used by a number of different airlines including both jal and ana the lounge was really nothing more than a place to seat with an offering of some basic soft drinks coffee and a little alcohol but that is pretty much as expected for a domestic lounge the flight was scheduled for am and boarded as scheduled at am the flight was operated using a b configured in jclass ie domestic business class in a x configuration i was in the aisle seat on the side all seats were full in jclass for the morning flight seats were reclining seats with a little recline only but for a short flight that was fine i was quite tired and therefore napped through the entire hour flight there might have been a drink service but i would have napped throught it the flight arrived on time and luggage delivery was quick with the luggage coming out shortly after i arrived at the baggage reclaim hall one thing to note is that the arrival time of am meant that by the time i exited the airport and caught the limousine bus at am it was rush hour so the expressway out of the airport was more like a parking lot than an expressway nevertheless i was able to reach shinjuku station by around am,3
cannot speak highly enough of jal premium economy row h and k are the best seats great leg room away from the toilets and the galley jal premium economy gives you access to the qantas business lounge and the jal business lounge,5
we were flying from tokyo to okinawa in february we had originally booked all of our flights using a travel agent in maryland we went from guam to tokyo tokyo to misawa misawa to tokyo tokyo to okinawa okinawa to guam from this listing you can see we were traveling a lot in japan japan airlines had been fine thus far until this flight there were of us traveling went first no issues then we were helped by two other staff they first gave us one figure for our luggage overage then they tried again and gave us another figure for the overage then there was an issue because our flight was originally booked in america which made it international even if we were flying from haneda airport to okinawa which is a domestic destination they took our money then told us they needed to have the back office clear our reservations and i guess our money too the they told us to go out of the line and wait on the side until the back office could verify our reservations and our money we asked how long we would be waiting and they said minutes we said no why are we not getting our boarding passes and change for the bags we gave them yen well they kept leaving the counter and asking us to leave finally we asked for a supervisor for assistance minutes later a supervisor appeared with still another amount for our excess baggage and our boarding passes and our change she just kept saying so sorry so sorry no real explanation of what the hold up was about or why the difference in the pricing for the excess baggage i do know when jal does screw up they screw up big time no explanation it took us over minutes to check in we probably would have still been standing there had we not asked for a supervisor really then we took the flight and really they cater to their japanese speaking clients on these domestic flights explanation in english but no written signs in english happy to get to okinawa and happier that my flight to guam will be with united and not jal i would be leary of flying jal if you flight was originally booked in america and your are flying out of haneda to another part of japan,2
excellent service excellent food the cabin crew were very polite and frequently helped passangers put their bags into the overhead bins this is almost unheard of now among the us carriers one little thing that was a nice touch was a cardboard sign at the entrance area of baggage claim indicating the appropriate belt number i know the screens eventually give the information but to me it was still a great touch at the end of a long flight,5
great food great inflight entertainment lots of leg room and comfortable seats the onboard service was very good staff very friendly great customer service would definitely fly with this airline in the future,5
myself and my sons flew economy direct sydney to tokyo narita return with jal january this year jl jl like all things japanese the whole flight ran like clockwork we booked online through a uk based booking agent for around per ticket cheaper than either the airlines direct or any other site sydney check in was good and well managed the return tokyo check in was perfect sydney being sydney the snowboards had to be taken to oversized baggage counter after weighing our luggage however at narita they just went straight through with the rest of our bags the kilo checked luggage allowance by kilo bags plus carry on is double that of qantas and much appreciated when taking snowboards boots apres boots ski jackets etc and there was no extra charge for the oversized luggage the plane itself was near brand new the seats comfortable for economy seats ample leg room good entertainment system and wide choice of what to watch inflight service was excellent meals offered were good and the fight attendants attentive and helpful to sum it up it was a typical japanese experience efficient on time in fact early on the return leg and exactly what you paid for,5
the flight was great foods was good order special meal when i travel to tpe because of there is beef on the going flight n normal meal on return the crew service was ok there is chinese crew onboard that who cant speak english or japanese i dont like is the announcement as its too long cant watch the movie n cannot finish due to the long announcements entertainment was good as there new movies return was delay more than min due to waiting for one missing passenger plus atc hold which i dont think its good for other passengers who have connections,4
flew dfw to bangkok round trip two legs each way through narita second leg of flight was basic economy from narita to bangkok premium economy not offered premium economy was very comfortable and amenity filled blanket headset eye mask pillow slippers provided with good seating room i would give it an eight of basic economy few amenities and crowded of premium economy or higher is way to go crew very friendly and offered great service of food japanese oriented menus and about airline average of boarding system very strange and inefficient jal does not recognize pre check in us overall would fly again at or above premium economy,4
stars airlines and best economy cabin by skytrax cant lie im really really comfortable flyingwith japan airlines good staff very helpfull seat so fluffy and distance every seat very wide ill fly again with japan airlines arigatou,5
so this is really a pity as i find the jl a great flight and the service of jal is fabulous but the transfer at lhr terminal is a shambles minutes wait at security as no fast track security in transfer zone so almost missed connection even if i had a minute connection time so while jal is great the ba service and treatment on the ground is a disaster now some will say that the solution is to go through immigration and back in through the first wing of terminal after brexit that will not be a solution unless immigration controls as as today this will make transfers at heathrow unviable it is a pity for jal with a fabulous service and product to have it devalued by ba no longer paying for the fast track security for terminal transfers same problem a week ago transferring through heathrow to a ba connection from africa,3
checkin was quick and efficient the flight attendant staff were all friendly and professional even though the economy class seat i had was not an aisle seat there was still plenty of leg room available my flight from bangkok suvarnabhumi to tokyo narita was smooth comfortable and on time i always enjoy listening to the japanese language from native speakers thanks jal i had a pleasant experience,5
japan airlines is a comfortable flight even in economy there is plenty of legroom for someone of my height ft in and the amenities are plentiful during your flights over the ocean all of the seats recline back a good amount and the inflight entertainment is incredibly diverse not the cheapest but not the most expensive jal ends up being pretty affordable for the value you receive,5
i have flown with a variety of airlines over the years and until i flew with jal my favorite airline was an american competitor not any morejal is number one in my book now from baggage check in through deportation of the plane the customer is treated like a king even though i was flying economy i felt as though i was in first class thank you jal for such a wonderful flight experience and please keep up the good work,5
a very comfortable flight from moscow to tokyo looking forward to flying this company again because the flight attendants are so experienced and professional and many things are made me feel like a guest not just like a passenger although the webpage is a bit tricky for me so i did not manage to understand how to book the vegetarian meal i hope to find this option of the next flight,5
flight to misawa was great just enough legroom for my long legs if the flight was longer than hours i would have not been able to enjoy the flight with the current leg room the seats were comfortable and the staff was very pleasant and courteous the ride was smooth until we got closer to misawa they we did experience bumpy skies but we were able to land and got our baggage and then got out to experience the snow all in all it was a quiet flight,5
this was a nonstop flight from boston to tokyo and it was by far the best flight experience i had ever had the attendants were flawlessly dressed and extremely polite the food was excellent and the plane was spotless,5
great quick flight with excellent service jal always lives up to its reputation as a topnotch quality airline i like that when weather related problems at my destination could have caused a delay or diversion of my flight jal notified me about it delays can be quite annoying to say the least and by being informed about the possibility lessens the impact the flight wound up being delayed about minutes,4
日本航空公司班機 上次一月份去日本東京 乘搭日本航空公司 令我對日本航空公司非常有歸屬感 服務品質高 食物又差 japan airline i go japan for shopping and i took japan airline i have some comments for this airline it is really good nice food than others airline good service and polite even i book econ class the seat also wide and comfortableit have wiskey drink and beer and snack i like it so much i will suggest my family and friend to take japan airline if for family trip to japan so i do choose japan airline each time i flight to tokyo it is my first choice airline thank you so much,5
the airline was perfect the flight crew epic and the food wonderful the boeing dreamliner as outfitted by jal is the worst aircraft on this planet and likely any others whatever you do avoid the and go for the the space between the forward seat and your face is so close that it renders the entertainment system useless see the enclosed photo having purchased the seats months before departure jal could have made a bit of an effort to seat my wife and i together but it is still the seat spacing that makes this ride terrible only two classes of seats economy and first class no good options here food crew cleanliness and everything else was wonderful just a miserable ride,5
this was my first experience with japan airlines and overall it was very pleasant i had the pleasure of sitting in business class and honestly its the only way to travel on a long flight food was excellent flight attendants were very professional and well put together and i loved having a ton of leg room only downside the wifi was useless i purchase a flight pass and it worked for the first hour thats okay i entertained myself with free movies and shows two thumbs up for japan airline,5
flew on business class last december flight was great and we have accumulated milage on several of our flights with them service is great but the japan milage bank website is so bad we tried to redeem the milage and it was so difficult to use we can only book flights to or from japan booking process is so tedious i have used kriflyer several times and it is much easier to use i can complete a booking within minutes on krisflyer website i spent half an hour on jal milage bank site and finally gave up their customer service is also very bad the wait time is minutes or more,1
this was our first jal flight as we usually do long haul flights with another carrier i think the legroom was better than what we are used to however that is where the similarity ends there was no menu and no idea what drink options there were when meal time comes you are offered one of two choices the food was fine though service through the night is limited which is normal one flight was slightly delayed but that is not usually the fault of the airline overall we arrived safely in relative comfort and that is what matters to me it was a pretty good flight but still a bit to go for top marks,4
great flight good food and nice staff the only bad thing is the hours flight its too long obviously jal is not responsible for that when i take a plane for or hours flight i have no problem so with nearly hours i came very tired,5
by far the best economy seat i have ever flown i am over feet tall and there was more room especially leg room when the seat in front was reclined service is top notch and the staff are especially polite and helpful best economy i have ever flown,5
terrible service hours delay and no information no servies for business class not stars airline,1
airline between tsa and hnd is a popular choice for its short distance to downtown and jal has an advantage of flight time for tw based passengers however the deployed airplanes for jl and jl is quite olddecorated the seat facility including seat adjustments personal tv or even seat width are all quite medium to low quality the seat adjustments are not working smoothly and personal tv touch screen is not always responsive the ground staff for my departing jl flight is not friendly either i had a ski luggage and she asked if there is a wax therein i answered it is a whole new ski and should be coated with wax and no box of wax additionally next i asked her whether wax is considered as flammable material so cannot be transported and no response from the staff anymore she just felt unhappy of a ski luggagea really bad experience of japanese company service both jl and jl boarding gates are quite far away from terminal entrance the passenger bridge is only with one entering way once biz class passenger seated all passengers will walk through your seats and need to mind not being slapped by other peoples jackets backpackers and even arms,3
we were going from cold weather mt fuji to warmer weather in okinawa so we had more than normal clothing we had to check in luggage per person and the allowance was only kg per person per person that means kg or lbs per suitcase some suitcases already weight lbs most airlines allow kg per suitcase even low budget airline like peach allows kg per suitcase we had to pay over us for overage and we were flying j class or their premium economy class what a rip off i definitely am not recommending jal to anyone i would definitely like to hear from someone at jal to hear their explanation,1
i took an end of january jal flight from vancouver to tokyo narita and was surprised at how empty business class was i counted the front section of the b where i was seated seat k right side first row window and about half the seats were empty therefore almost every passenger had an empty seat beside them and with toilets for business class there was always an available toilet with no wait the flight was punctual as is reliably common for jal and service and food was excellent i selected the japanese meal for the first meal lunch as i find generally the japanese meal is better than the western choices on jal the starter bento box provides an always interesting combination of many different small bites and overall the japanese meal seems more substantial than the western meal choices the main is always two meatchickenfish with rice and pickles and this time it was fish and chicken for the second meal a smaller snack before arrival i selected the western set as the japanese meal did not seem particularly interesting and was surprised when the flight attendant came back to advise me they were out of the western meal and whether i would take the japanese meal instead i reluctantly agreed and probably frowned as a minute later she returned to advise that another passenger had agreed to switch their meal choice and she would be able to serve the western meal to me after all i was glad as the western meal was very delicious particularly the mango citrus slaw and the soft fresh rolls i noticed jal was serving two junmai daiginjo sakes on the flight so i asked to try one expecting to be poured a small cup for tasting instead i was given a whole small ml bottle which was very nicely full bodied but much more than i could drink the usual complaint about the xx layout and no direct aisle access for window seats in the b dreamliner used by jal for this route did not apply this time as the half empty plane meant i had an empty seat beside me so no effort to step over another passenger the angle flat seat is still not as good for sleeping as a fully horizontal flat seatbed but i did note jal has introduced a new dense foam pillow instead of the previous soft fill pillow and it was much more supportive being in the first row i had the smaller pull out from the armrest screen instead of the larger screens in the other rows which have the screens on the back of the previous row but i always thought the smaller screen was a good trade off for a window seat that has much easier step over access if there is a passenger in the aisle seat and because jal does not have as broad a selection of movies as cathay pacific or british airways for example by comparison but i was a bit surprised jal had bohemian rhapsody playing on the flight whereas a cathay pacific flight i took on the next day did not have it yet checking on future planned travel i discovered that jal will be switching to a b on the route during the peak season starting in early june and that the plane will be equipped with jals much nicer fully flat sky suite ii with direct aisle access for all seats however the trade off appears to be price as flights in early june to around midoctober seem to be priced around the range round trip instead of the current or so,5
we enjoyed a wonderful flight with japan airlines from tokyo narita to frankfurt return in january the flight from narita to frankfurt is of high appeal to me as i do not like night flying and with a departure out of narita around am local time and arrival into frankfurt at pm local time and flying over the beauty of northern russia it is a fantastic flight similiarly the return flight from frankfurt is daylight with a pm departure out of fra and afternoon arrival into nrt the ongoing service in flight catering and on board facilities of the boeing dreamliner series is fantastic the only failure was the jal lounge at frankfurt which is definitely not up to jal standards the venue catering and the environment is none different to a school classroom needs a major overhaul we look forward to flying same route with jal again next year,5
my partner and i booked the listed tickets and received multiple emails of cancellation of seats and change of flights this resulted in the following firstly seating that was not together secondly downgrade to economy i called and spoke to a jal representative and i was informed that premium economy was not available due to the change of flight and was told i had to downgrade to economy or pay the difference and upgrade to business i then asked if other dates were available for premium economy as my partner is a tall gentleman and cannot fly economy and was told that no dates can be confirmed i asked to speak to a manager and this was denied i had to argue to have a refund which i still have not received this has been an appalling experience and subsequently ruined our holiday to japan i would never fly with japan airlines or recommend jal services based on the extremely poor service i received there was absolutely no attempt to fix the problem which your airline created by changing the flight good customer services means assisting the customer this was not the case a very unsatisfactory outcome,1
the overall experience from the lounge to the flight was sub par i was expecting a lot more and was completely disappointed the lounge was very old and the food wasnt far behind the flight was just ok and the seat was old as well,3
chose the airline because of the japan explorer pass that is available for foreigners to fly domestic routes on a very affordable fare service and comfort on board was good check in process is very efficient and staff courteous and helpful would definitely choose jal again because of the provision of this explorer pass thank you,4
we flew jal recently from singapore narita airport hawaii and i would highly recommend jal airline the chair for the airline is larger than other airlines since i had plenty leg and elbow room i felt comfortable the whole flight so cant complain too much the in flight entertainment content was plentiful so if you stay awake the whole way you wont be bored the staff was very helpful and service was excellent,4
we flew jal recently from melbourne to tokyo narita and i would recommend this airline to friends and family and not hesitate in flying with them again i had booked the tickets using webjet and then choose our seats by visiting the jal website after consulting seat guru i would have liked to see the price for premium economy but this was not an option on webjet it may have been out of our budget anyway as my son and husband are quite tall i prebooked aisle seats for them the seat configuration on our flights were so we had one seat behind the other in order to get the aisle the seats seem to be slightly deeper and there seemed to be more elbow room due to the seat configuration dont get me wrong it is not premium economy though but we were comfortable from check in to boarding and landing the customer service was spot on the plane left on time with no delays the flight to tokyo was an over nighter and we were given a snack bag and then breakfast close to arrival on the flight home from tokyo to melbourne we had a flight during the day and we were served lunch and dinner there was a good offering of movies and entertainment which was easy to access we were very impressed with jal and will definitely fly with them again,4
we flew jal from pvg to kix and a return flight nrt to pvg recently and we were totally wowed by the level of service we received the comfort on board and the efficiency of boardingdeplaning the meals were edible though nothing incredible by the hagen daz ice cream was a nice touch we loved the skykiwi drink and were so please that we could opt for that along with a glass of wine and a cup of hot green tea after our meal in flight entertainment was awesome and especially on our second flight when we had a newer plane with their extrawide economy seats we were so comfortable one of our best flights ever they gave us blankets even for the short haul flights and the little things like cup holders and extra compartments in the seat back really made for an enjoyable flight cant wait to fly jal again,5
jal is supposed to be all about customer service and i did not get that i went in line and due to a codeshare flight i checked with their staff to check if this was the right place i need to be the staff in polo shirts were like no you need to go gates down carrying two heavy luggage i raced there to find out i need to go back to the original spot sweating and tired i told them of the situation and they tell me that the staff in their check in counter area dont know how to speak english and not their staffso this situation does not have to do with jal ummm ok then one of my bags was kilos over and they charged me haha great service recovery too _,2
the food and drink options were excellent the seat didnt lay completely flat and i ended up sleeping reclined but was very comfortable i feel like premium economy may be the best value for the dollar with this airline but if its not available then business class is still a good but pricey option cheers,4
yes the way it should be when flying highly respectful and well educated crew staff absolutely ravishing food real champagne not fake bubbly like on first haha american or even worse ua and of course japanese elegance i tried ana several times each time was disappointing so i came back to jal by far the best airline on oneworld together with qatar and cathay all the rest on that alliance just pathetic big seats good selection of foodelegant dark designunlike that horrible ana blue either japanese or european mealsdrinks first class excellent wine selectionnothing to complain,5
everything first class is supposed to be private compartments great ameneties bose headphones excellent food and wine pajamas and lie flat beds made up with mattress pad and quilt by attentive flight attendants,5
this airline is a amazing lots of food to eat hostess was great everything with the flights was great i would recommend to everyone,5
i flew melnrthel in premium economy before flying on to oslo returning from hamburg in october and november simply put this is an amazing experience with space galore and a comfy seat the food is the same as economy but its good and you can get champagne or sky time kiwi which is well worth a try as is the udon de sky service was top notch too both narita and helsinki airports are easy and stressfree to navigate unusually for premium economy lounge access is thrown in but you cant really take advantage of it so good are the connections downsides the cabin temperature was a bit warm and the entertainment a bit lacking in english stuff well it is a japanese airline and it looks like theyre discontinuing premium economy from mel to nrt in early may but these are not enough to keep me away ive booked them again in may over to budapest in premium economy back from paris in economy,5
the seats are spacious and lots of legroom compare to other airlines and the sector is also quite zone very comfortable when travel on long direct flight,5
jal service was very good food staff cleanliness amenities movies were average a big bonus in jal premium economy is access to the business lounge this was a great surprise we enjoyed breakfast in sydney and several drinks and nibbles in tokyo on the way home in a comfortable setting everything is as youd expect in this class of service except there is no priority boarding we had the first row of premium economy which provides even more space and leg room although tv screens must fold away,5
while this is a long flight it is a direct flight which is a huge plus the flight attendants were all very polite because its a long flight everyone gets a pillow and a blanket you dont get that all the time i was able to plug in watch movies etc and charge my phone watch etc the entire time and even though we had to depart a bit late the pilots made up a lot of the time overall a really good experience same good experience on the way back,5
the economy seats are super spacious and comfortable compared to other airlines as an average height person some economy seats felt very cramped and the barely reclined but with japan airline my knee was nowhere near the seats in front when reclined the angle is very good that i almost thought that i was in premium economy,5
i took this flight together with my family the service was awesome attendant and friendly crew i would also like to compliment the food that was served best airline food ive had in economy class tokyo to manila leg,4
had the opportunity to fly to japan tokyowakayamanagoya on a holiday in december and decided to fly via jal it was one of the best decisions we ever made the flight was cheaper than some other airlines and the seats were way more spacious even roomier than the sq premium economy which i took from mlb to sg service was impeccable and food was decent definitely good value for money and comfortable too,5
we wouldnt think of flying to japan with another airline in my wife and i made three roundtrips between san francisco and tokyo on jal in premium economy which might be the greatest bargain in airline travel for a few hundred extra dollars you get the lounge before flying and your bags get business priority the seats are plenty spacious and lack nothing in comfort the servers are unfailingly attentive and charming they dont wake up sleeping passengers for any reason this is the incomparable injapan treatment that we love,5
american airlines booked us with japan airlines we rode on the dreamliner premium economy seats were plenty comfy if you can get first class the chairs adjusted in the legs and back and even had a foot rest the movie selection was nice i liked the goodie bag they even had noice canceling head phones which was so helpful for a hour flight the crew was so kind and kept the lavatories clean where they left toothbrushes after dinner i appreciated their food thats what tickled me most the mid flight snack was noodles look at the pic airplanes on the noodle or veg couldnt figure that out japan airlines lounge was nice i pigged out there too again the crew was great at all three airports,5
great onboard service and hard product flight delayed due to incoming passengers much confusion with the gate team trying to get the flight boarded very polite but very disorganized,4
ive always heard that jal airlines was a great arline but now that ive experienced it for myself i strongly disagree ive been flying first and business class for over years so i know a great airline when i see it never have i been told that i cant have something to eat thats on the menu until jal and they also were very slow responding to my request i paid extra to get extra but its obvious jal trears you like an economy flier biggest waist of money and i will never fly this airline again there are so many amazing business class flights to choose from its sad that for the extra money i paid they still dont value the customer needs serious improvements food selection was poor,3
cabin staff is excellent truly caring friendly helpful exceptionally clean cabin great coffee no pajamas but a reusable cardigan is offered feels a little strange good slippers ok blanket food is not quite what it used to be,5
one of the biggest airlines in japan but compared with another ana japan airlines have older aircraft and service is not so good,3
this airline has excellent service by all staff i was on a very very long trip and while the other more american airline was okay as soon as i transfered to japan airline it was quite a difference you are made to feel welcome by all staff at the gate and while in the air everyone is smiling and offering to help you or serve you when the gate agents arrived to open it they all looked at their customers in the gate area and bowed to us i will always fly this airline if i have a choice,5
first time jal flyers and what an amazing flight the cabin staff were dressed very professional extremely polite and efficient in tending to the passengers the food was very tasty and the plane was clean and restrooms were well tended to they even provided disposable toothbrushes they also provided comfortable blankets and pillows my husband and i agreed that it was like flying years ago when the airlines and employees took pride in their jobs we will fly jal again,5
my first trip across the pacific was accentuated by comfortable accommodations attentive flight attendants and delicious food i had to return early because of an emergency at home which necessitated traveling coach the accomodtions were not as comfortable and spacious but the food was good and the attendants were so polite and helpful i look forward another trip in the future on this fine airline,5
mostly the legs of the flights seemed smooth only the last leg from narita to lax was very turbulent that i thought we would die the food was good i loved the ice cream cups no sushi though going from narita to mnl there was no other choice but a salmon meal which was not okay because hubby is allergic to seafood so he did not eat anything good thing the flight was just about hours he survived regarding cleanliness the flight from mnl to narita there were so much dust where the carry on luggage bins were and the aircraft itself,4
this is my first time travelling with jal with my family we are adults and children age flight is on time and smooth during my travel date the entertainment and food are good and we have comfortable seats as well definitely will choose jal again if we travel to japan again,4
have flew several airlines from usa to asia specifically hong kong for more than years no airline services can match japan airline locking up in a airplane for more than hours the high quality services offered by the flight crews is crucial jal has the best western and japanese food menu the fresh cook rice and most important is the food served by exceptional professional jal flight crews the flight attendants are not just smile but maintain the virtues of japanese hospitality and kindness they create an atmosphere of comfortable and memories i always felt my hour flight as if it were only a few hours,5
no need to say more best flight ever hostesses were very accommodating even though it was a short hr flight i would travel japan airlines again,5
this direct flight from jfk to narita was a dream i was impressed from the moment i checked in at the ticket counter the agent noticed that i was tall and without me asking arranged to have my seat changed to the exit row where there was unrestricted room for my legs the onboard staff was extremely professional courteous and helpful the flight departed on time and arrived early my premium economy seat was comfortable enough relative to business class on board entertainment was expansive i was a bit disappointed in the quality of the meals although the meals on my return jal flight were excellent i have flown to japan several times before on delta and kal but jal will be my first preference in the future,5
everything was perfect the staff was incredible friendly and the food was good the flight was on time ive just loved everything,5
travel a lot in last twenty years and always impressed with jal orderly clean timely great service from ticket counter till departure from destination terminal attendants on board are friendly courteous timely and helpful i am old enough to remember most american airlines were this way sad,4
four stars for hard product and food only third time in long haul first class on this flight first time traveling with my husband jal wins on hard product mostly for being able to see out the windows and the memory foam mattress the food on this flight was excellent as for all other aspects i still prefer ana cristal was gone before dinner service mostly because they kept my husbands glass full and mine empty i was basically ignored and crew deferred to my husband interesting as i bought the tickets and am the only one with ow elite status i had to ring the call button multiple times and was not greeted with the typical japanese high level of cabin service was treated more as an inconvenience if i can redeem miles for the ticket ill fly again otherwise my cash goes to ana,4
unbelievably good flight what an unexpensive award its amazing how travel in asia carries great value and excelent service this was a ba award flew economy plus cabin for a hour flight perfect marvelous lounge service great on board food terrific entertainment,5
flew the family of us to tokyo i am very experienced international traveler countries so far very spoiled as i usually flew business but flew economy plus with the family from ny jfk to tokyo and was very pleasantly surprised i have back issues too but premium economy had lots of leg room and the seats were large and comfortable enough for this big american male the food was good but not great so we traveled with some extra snacks however overall we found the service to be excellent very professional and attentive was overall very pleased with the airline,4
in flight staffs treated my family and i very badly i never imagined to experience something like this in my life worst flight of my life time and my opinion jal is worst airline of all after took off my flight jl narita to melbourne one hour later my two years old daughter was trow up we both were all cover with vomit staffs only helped us by bought us some wet towels but i did have to clean everything myself i used my dirty top to cover the seat which still dirty with vomit i know my daughter throw up so did try to not bother much for help but my top covered with vomit so had to ask if they have spare top and they helped me with one cardigan i did offer to buy this cardigan but she said is was ok and i did plan to ask if how she want us to return this top however no one offer to help and ask how about us treat us like it was your fault u better leave with it then hours before landing one japaness staff did come to ask my husband to return the cardigan because she need to do stock taking and want to make sure we return it then just mins later another staff came to ask me to make sure we have to return the cardigan in mins really i never feel treated like this before do u think we really need your logo cardigan that much do you really think we need to take it with us that bad we did not want even wore it if my sweater was not full of vomit all you care is the cardigan what i going to wear have u ever care how well of my daughter have u ever came and ask how she feel why did she throw up not even once you came and ask how my family are doing alright she is only what you care is only the one cheap cardigan which have your logo on the chest who want to ware that we return your cardigan straight away that show me enough if something ever happened jal staffs will definitely worry about their belonging more than passengers sorry this matter also shows me enough about what is jal airline main focus is and i will make sure will not travel with you again mark my word even we have free ticket i will not take it that flight make me feel so bad like i am a criminal try to steal your stuff i did pay for nearly for my family and all my staffs to travel with japan airlines and let me tell you worst decision ever this trip is worst trip of my lifetime thank to you and i will make sure i will pass this message to everyone i know to not use japan airlines again in the future because if accidents happen they will not care no courtesy no care no customers service worst than budget airline food also bad not and never again,1
the seat is comfortable even for economy class cabin crew always stand by and look after passangers even in the evening when most of people fall asleep the minus is only theres no wifi,5
i was flying back after a ski accident in club med sahoro which made it impossible to walk with no pain at my knee with children and a couple of luggages my husband was struggling a friend suggested asking for assistance from the airline right from the start at obihiro they took care of everything all the crews were informed connecting flight from nareda was totally full but everyone from ground to flight did they best to make it easier and comfortable for me we appreciate all the extra effort and they did it with so much pleasure that i felt bad being such a burden when we arrived in singapore this experience was different all the arrangement was made but somehow the ground crews gave me the feeling that it was grudging meant to be the disparity in attitudes were so great that i can only accord the attention and assistance received from japan sectors were truely exceptional i am flying next week for work alone still needing assistance to move around lets see if singapore airlines is as good as they claim i will share again,5
after a long flight from sfo to tokyo my boyfriend and i were sure we were going to miss our connecting flight to new chitose minutes to clear customs transfer bags and make it to our new gate this was the last flight of the night upon leaving the plane a jal agent was waiting for me and my boyfriend with a printed sign with our names she said she knew we had a tight connection and rushed us through customs grabbed our bags for us and her and a couple other agents helped us navigate to our connecting flight they literally carried our bags and ran with us through the airport in the us not only would we have missed our flight but our bags definitely would not have made it this was hands down the most amazing customer service experience japan airlines for the win,5
clean new plane nice comfortable seat amazing meal as good as any you would find at a great steak house the service was exceptional polite quite and attentive at all times many other carriers could learn well from observing the jal crew on this flight could not give them higher marks the only two downsides on this were that in the business class seat although it was comfortable the lie flat is on an angle which makes it tough to sleep and the internet was not working the entire time spotty reception,5
family of booked premecom pe seats same price as qf disc economy syd to nrt pe seats excellent heaps of leg room especially front row food same as economy rate jal pe best ive travelled,5
the only reason for giving four stars instead of five was that the plane felt ready for a refresh the wear and tear on the seats and seating areas were apparent so that said i cant recommend the airline highly enough when it comes to service and quality the air hosts were all absolutely amazingly attentive their dedication to ensuring that passengers had a comfortable flight was apparent from the moment we boarded until our departure and this was true on both our inbound and outgoing flight a pal who travelled first class said it was superior in all respects the food was light years better than the food ive experienced on other airlines the bed was comfortable the beverage selection was first rate and the flight was smooth and utterly painless i arrived in japan refreshed and ready to explore i would absolutely recommend this airline and i would fly with them again in a heartbeat,4
i couldnt recommend japan airlines any more highly i flew with jal from melbourne to tokyo tokyo to sapporo and then in reverse excellent service meals entertainment and comfort,5
the flight was excellent save one issue the tortoise shell chicken meal was not very good and i was only able to eat a very small portion of it the airline claimed it was made by some award winning chef and this meal was picked to be served to economy class passengers my advice is to stock up on snacks and eat a large meal before boarding i lived in japan for years and am not a stranger to the cuisine,4
my first time with japan airlines has been fab experience especially in terms to the leg room choice of movies and attitude of the stewardess even though a red eye flight they were prompt and not grouchy when i asked them for drinks etc i love the efficiency they had compared to the other apparentlyworld class airlines we travel by i would highly recommend japan airlines this would definitely be our preferred airline for now,4
when traveling in economy class the most important is the seat and legroom this is my first time flying with jal and im amazed how spacious the legroom and i also believed that the seat is wider than other airlines i also find out that one of the toilet is bigger than usual the toilet have an additional space for baby changing diaper i would highly recommend for everyone that plan to travel with economy class to try jal,5
we were impressed with the helpfulness of the flying attendants they reacted to a small and big issues with a genuine care treated us extremely nicely,5
the service on jal isnt bad unfortunately its clear that they are operated by the same company as american airlines which to me means theyre underfunded the planes are fairly old seating is less spacious food is subpar and the movie screens and tech is all outdated all in all this is still a better airline than say china eastern but thats not saying much dont book with jal expecting better food or service because they are japanese this company operates more like american airlines which means theyre stingy with economy class theyre out to make money more than to please their customers qatar is a far better option,3
i experienced very good service from check in to off board very typical japanese hospitality that never went wrong,5
this is malaysian airline code share operated by japan airline the food quality and quantity was simply no never enjoyed airline foodlike thisfor a long time very attentive,5
i continue to fly jal for my trips to japan i wont ever consider a us carrier why would anyone want to im willing to pay the difference in price for a completely different experience clean bathrooms good food impeccably dressed flight attendants helpful flight attendants pleasant flight attendants comfortable seats i could go on and on this time i opted to try premium economy and was glad i did not inexpensive but totally worth it unlike us carriers that charge you extra just for a bit more leg room and nothing else same way how they charge you for baggage the premium economy seats are wider and have a crazy amount of leg room premium economy also grants you access to the jal lounge excellent food and beverages rather than eating at restaurants and their crazy prices at honolulu airport youre able to have a really nice meal and relax in comfort the narita lounge is even nicer a bit better outfitted im not sure but the food spread also seemed to be a bit larger all in all another fantastic experience on jal another reason why im flying less and less to the us mainland why subject myself to the torture of flying us airlines when i can fly to japan and have a great time,5
having previously flown into tokyo from lax and disappointed with the service and attitude the flight from tokyo to melbourne on a was back up there with typical jal standards the staff were friendly and attentive the food was designed and prepared in japan not lax by top chefs and it was very good the flight departed ontime and arrived on time and priority bags came out first and quickly well done jal,4
japan airlines is like the united air of japan also known as nikkō is the flag carrier airline of japan the service is incredible from the moment you step into the aircraft just after takeoff you are presented with a hot towel just like first class hahah then a snack plus a drink alcohol is free on international flight then two meal service and two more snacks pluse constant drinks the food is really good portions are standerd size a tip if you never flew an asian airline before its warm in the plane to warm for mearound digs but my wife was happy,4
i flew on this airline for both domestic flights within japan and international flights tofrom japan the service was great as the attendants were probably the most polite that ive encountered the food was good and i liked the variety of entertainment some of the flights i was on had free wifi while on other flights i watched a few anime movies and read their selection of manga titles the premium economy class was slightly more comfortable with more legroom and amenities but i probably wouldnt choose that class over regular economy class if i had to pay for the tickets myself as regular economy was pretty good by itself,5
this was my first flight on jal i was excited to fly them as ive read great things i am a bit of a snob and like to travel biz class but cathay and jal one world guys wanted ridicules prices for biz hong kong to hnd rtn so went with premium economy over all i would fly them again but i dont think its worth more then economy the seats were very comfy and would be great for long hall good entertainment and big screen im used to premium econ on qantas which is a step just under biz this was just a step over econ the food was ok if you are into japanese food and there was no pre flight drink and i had to ask for alcohol it wasnt offered the flight attendants were very respectful and polite i could not fault them if i could put jal flight attendants on qantas flights that would be perfect we left a little late and the pilot was asking forgiveness and it wasnt his fault we made up the time no worries at times we were traveling over kph thats the fastest ive ever travelled summary great crew and plane poor food i would travel short or long hall without question just look for better prices thanks jal for my intro to japanese culture ps i loved seeing the ground crew bow to the plane and wave until we left,4
jal is the best jal is the best i needed to write that twice because there is no other airline i would rather fly they are classy smart very serious about excellent service helpful and the model for any other airline ive been flying all over for over years on a whole range of aircraft but jal is always in first place highly recommended,5
we had a great flight back in when we took premium economy pe back from haneda to singapore so this time we book pe both ways but it wasnt as enjoyable the lounge at singapore is not great as its not the jal lounge the food and drinks served are not of japanese standard we hardly ate anything and the lounge is not conducive can hardly find couch seats the toilet in the flight to tokyo is also bad it smells of urine and it was only half way thru the flight but the service from the stewardess is still great the lounge at narita was awesome though its crowded but its still conducive with lots of seating great fooddrinks,4
i read all the reviews before i purchased my business class tickets on jal some how though i missed any reviews on the business class hard product out of san diego i thought the product would be the same as out of la why would it be different yet it was i was shocked to find on the san diego flight they use the old style configuration and the seats dont go completely flat plus no privacy i was very disappointed to say the least for me it was not comfortable and will never go that route again i actually felt cheated out of my money especially for the same price i could have flown a nicer product out of la this was the first time ive flown jal it wont be the last either as the service was outstanding probably the best ive experienced but ill be much more careful in the future to do my research on which type of business class seats jal is using on a particular flight,4
i took the short domestic flight on jal from osaka itami airport to tokyo haneda airport to connect to an international flight from narita itami airport is very close to osaka city center so a quick half hour limousine bus ride was all that was needed to get to the airport check in was quick and i used my one world alliance status to access the diamond premier lounge near gate nothing fancg but there is a good amount of seating including lots of counter seating next to the small food area with a selection of a few bakery items to snack on in addition to offerings of drinks the flight was operated on a b and i was in j class which is domestic business class nothing fancy here just regular seats with a slight recline configured i had an aisle seat next to the window seat but had unlimited legroom and no disturbance from my neighbour on access since we were on an exit row with no seats in front of us the flight was very busy and j class appeared to be full due to the short flight there was time only for a quick drinks service which was efficiently done with the usual jal grace and courtesy flight was on time luggage delivery was fairly quick and it was easy to reserve and board the limousine bus to connect from haneda airport to narita airport,4
maybe it was an off day but a feature of jal is their friendly and attentive staff but on this flight the crew seemed disinterested and there were few smiles or attention or for that matter interest the food standard was ok but not to the standard when flying out of japan where they use famous chefs as the inspiration for their dishes but out of lax the famous chefs were not in the bedd menu maybe because they cannot guarantee the quality available in japanthe aircraft was an older boeing and not as comfortable as a but having said that it departed on time and despite km heads winds arrived on schedulestill much better than most domestic us airlines but noy what one comes to expect from jal,3
they always give us a great friendly service last time i went to japan they couldnt fly due to a strong wind but they offered me a transportation to go to the different airport and a hotel to stay i love japan airline,5
i paid the premium fare as i wanted to sleep and enjoy a great meal jal delivered unfortunately the nashville to japan portion of the trip was on jals code share airline american subject of a negative review under american airlines americans food and service is much below that of jal as an added bonus jals checked luggage allowance is kilos higher than american and they allow three checked bags vs two on american,5
comfortable direct flight i request halal meal and it was nice and delicious very friendly cabin crews,5
wonderful staff attentive and friendly comfortable flight good movies on in seat monitor lots of fluids served to keep us hydrated nice hot clothes to wash our face and hands,5
i have never written a review for an airline but felt indebted to share my experiences for its excellent service and quality of the cabin first it was very spacious with lots of leg room probably more spacious than most of us major airlines the food was quite good compared to other airlines that i have taken my family and i actually finished all the food for both lunch and dinner which never happened before with other airlines furthermore their restrooms were huge and super clean they were all the time is it amazing one of the restroom could fit people even larger than the business class of other airlines that i have tried the best part was their service my family and i were celebrating our anniversary and birthday on this trip the chief flight attendant maru not sure if i got her name correctly and her crew members were so incredibly thoughtful that they gave us special gifts and a handwritten card we were so touched by their thoughtfulness they made our long journey to japan memorable and joyful highly recommended,5
first time using this airline which i found to be very good i would fly with them again it was business trip,4
plane very clean staff very polite food above average washroom clean regularly good choice of movies,5
i always use jal as a point of comparison when talking airlinesflights simply the best air travel experience i have ever had,5
the check in process was easy the stewardesses were all very nice the airline was incredibly clean and the food was actually pretty good,5
this was a hour flight it was a very comfortable flight they came around very often with food and stuff to drink there in plent to watch on the little monitor in front of you in many different languages as well as listen to misinterpret if you like the seats are a little wider than on a regular plain ans every seat has a pellow and blanket so you can sleep they do turn the lights down lawn as well as lower all blinds to make it easy to sleep,5
the flight attendants couldnt do enough for you superb service quiet clean and exceedingly comfortable ride excellent food service and meals will fly again with jal,5
gentle and professional service with genuine smiles and courtesy food was well prepared and served on time however efforts need to improve on the childrens games and toys,4
the ground staff is excellent at the check in at cts helped me all the way with our twins traveling together the flight is average and the food and inflight entertainment leaving much room for improvement,4
im posting a followup to my previous review of jal which complained about their undisclosed refusal to allow seat selection or seat preferences to economy passengers at that time i had called their customer service and received no satisfaction subsequently i went to their website and made a strongly worded complaint on their contact us form this apparently went up a little higher and i was informed that their gate agents would be notified of my need for an aisle seat i was skeptical but to my surprise i was not only given aisle seats but preferred boarding and treated with kid gloves by all their personnel all four flights were on time and my travel experience with jal was excellent if i had not complained repeatedly perhaps i would be less satisfied but i have to say that they do take customer service issues seriously and my actual experience on the flights could not have been much better my last flight was only half full and jal still kept their schedule in stark contrast to garuda which canceled two flights on me that had not filled and caused some real headaches,4
japan airlines really impressed me their inflight meals for the economy class was quite good did not see what the first class people ate but i enjoyed it as many other carriers do not give meals to the economy class,5
from the friendly smiles to courteous demeanour nothing is more welcoming as you board the plane the stewardesses seem genuinely concerned about your comfort the other time we flew jal my niece with peanut allergy was with me and the attention they gave to addressing this was commendable from asking if someone eating peanuts nearby would affect her to providing allergen free food then checking if she was alright i cant say the same with their partner american airlines the leg room is longer and the seats much wider than most airlines the meals are also more appetising toilets are kept clean the only second thoughts i have is about the price but if i am able to get a promo price i will definitely take jal,4
the service is excellent the food is definitely better than most and the seats are nearly lay flat i fly pretty regularly to japan on jal and american you cant go wrong with either airline just make sure youre in business class,5
amazing service with great food and attention to detail on my way back due to a minor back injury the flight crew helped me with every part of the check in and settling into the plane and also made sure i had two seats to myself at the end of the flight the attendants went around and thanked every single passenger for taking japan airlines i travel a lot and take it over flights annually and japan airlines is always my favourite,5
cleancomfortable and quiet the only problem we had was our meals got mixed up on the first leg but our flight attendant was able to rustle something up for us she was so sweet we had a hour stop over in tokyo and we got to explore the airport what a great airport for the second flight the attendant at the gate was able to quickly order meals for us so we had no issues for the remainder of our journey polite and efficienta great airline,4
first time with jal after more than years in s i was surprised on how comfortable and very modern aircraft it is now i fly to tokyo and return back to jakarta i i enjoy good food movies music and even the toilet,5
i spent my entire birthday in airports and on planes with little to no communication with my family or friends while onboard before we landed they presented me with a birthday gift which absolutely made my day thank you so much jal for the amazing service awesome plane and the wonderful gift that made my birthday memorable,5
always on time friendly stewardesses clean seats and facilities highly recommended for low stress travel,4
pleasantly surprised by their service efficiency you get used to such a mediocre service with other airlines like delta american aireuropa norwegian etc that when you get to enter to an actual clean airplane bathroom you feel so amazed like if you were receiving a first class treatment i flew in four different flights with japan airlines in all of them we left on time boarding was very quick the staff was extremely nice and helpful i had severe allergies and my medicines made me more dehydrated than usual and they kept bringing me water and juices to battle both my allergies and the effects of a hour flight seats are hard not much cushion but they have good leg room and an ample selection of movies drinks i think it was a great for the price of the flight,4
this overnight flight was part of a jal package from europe back to australia through tokyo where we had had a day layover to mitigate jetlag the biz class flatbed pods are good the entertainment on the big flatscreen tv was more than acceptable the food western was a highlight as was the japanese single malt whisky the service was a little slow but very japanese and delightful it cannot be scored higher than four stars when benchmarked against other international business class flights taken in the past it was expensive jal charges heavily because there are only four carriers who fly tokyosydney direct jal ana qantas and jetstar which is effectively a qantas subsidiary there are other much cheaper ways to fly to europe if you do not have to go to japan,4
when returning to san diego from narita jal is the best for a direct flight it leaves at pm and arrives san diego at about am flight time is hours minutes the food is good in quantity and variety variety of alcohol good flight attendants are couteous and attentive the only thing i didnt like is that the plane is b and the toilets are in the middle of plane,4
last week i flew on japan airlines for the first time it was a memorable experience and very positive the service was top notch on the ground i had to have wheelchair assistance and jal uses their own employees to meet and transport its wheelchair passengers with uniformed personnel that could be mistaken for inflight attendants they were friendly spoke english perfectly and would not take a tip best wheelchair service i have encountered checkin was flawless and they actually came to me while i sat in the boarding area and asked me to board first then once at the plane they took my carryon luggage and stowed it for me the flight attendant introduced herself and let me know if i needed anything to let her know in flight service was again at a very high level with good food and very innovative some a result of a chef competition that they held i thought the minestroni soup and small loaf of bread for breakfast was perfect and a great substitute for the usual breakfasts on airlines seats were comfortable recaro seats and inflight entertainment had an excellent choice of movies coffee tea and water were offered several times during the flight some snacks were offered during flight in the flight attendant serving area but only rice crackers and some chocolate this is the only aspect that i would rate as below average the flight attendants were always available if one needed them and very cordial and attentive in vancouver i was again met at the gate by a jal employee and transported by wheelchair all the way through immigration and to my connecting area overall i had two very impressive and comfortable flights,5
every thing about the flight was perfect could not fault anything the seat was slightly narrower then other business class seats but comfortable,5
its the best service is excellent all very kind helpful and respectful unlike american airlines such as unitedamerican who has no pride in their work as ca food selection and the level of the taste was great too clean toilet that is cleaned by ca very often i highly recommend it,5
jal services are great there is nothing to point out i prefer to choose their airlines most of my travel trips,5
informative check in process warm greeting quick respond baggage handling its fabuluous food communicative air crew service its interior and film etc its crew action to clean a mesh,5
i had a pleasant return journey on jal on after climbing mt fuji the service was great the flight was punctual the take off landing was smooth and i enjoy the meals inflight entertainment thank you jal for the great experience,5
great airline with superb service going on japan air to singapore early feb in business class unfortunately have to fly coach back in march because i did not book soon enough,5
stly the meals served on board jal is not very nice compared to the other airlines i took previously my dept flight to chitose was ok but my return flight from chitose was chaotic because there was heavy snowfall when i reached chitose airport and all flights were suspended i would think such situations should be expected and managed in a more professional way the jal staff at the chitose airport cannot speak or understand english and that makes it worst during such chaotic situations especially for passengers like my group of which is our st time encountering this the staff should at least provide some positive substantial info and try to ease and calm the nervous passengers but they did not i have to go from jal staff to another to get to an english speaking staff who can understand and converse with me in the end i got a staff who was quite helpful and he speaks good english thank god we were able to get help from this particular staff and he managed to give us a standby tickets out of chitose,3
flights were on or aircraft jal is one of the few airlines that have a seat arrangement in economy most others squeeze an extra seat in each row so jal economy seats tend to be a tiny bit wider however the the distance between rows seems to be pretty tight for some reason i found the flight between melbourne and tokyo was much more comfortable than the flight between tokyo and vancouver the food and service were ok but nothing outstanding generally i would try to give the a miss and find a more spacious aircraft if possible always check seat guru for seating plans,3
if you can spend the money you will have a fabulous experience its night and day difference traveling in business class from economy service comfort so special,5
this has been my second time flying jal the first experience was bad when i had gotten a old vessel that wet my carry on bag which i placed below my seats however this time round was better i have wider leg space for seats civilised passengers in board and attentive cabin crew my flight involves flying into haneda airport and then transfer to a domestic flight to fukuoka i enjoyed both journey where i managed to get good quality sleep on board without being disturbed by unnecessary lighting or announcement in the flight airplane plane was average yet i also enjoyed haagen dazs ice cream given a dessert at the end of my meal for both of my trips,4
cas took care of me frequentry chief cas announcement in the flight is good enough japanese meal was good though idid not try western meal,5
this is a great flight for anybody going to japan especially for tourists visiting kyoto the flight departs from the nice tom bradley terminal at a reasonable hour and arrives in osaka before the trains stop running the train station connected has trains to takes you to kyoto in a little over an hour so you can spend the first evening in kyoto if you like if you are the type that cannot sleep on the plane there are good hotel options connected to the terminal there was no premium economy offered when i flew but it appear they will off that starting mid that will make the hour flight more bearable without costing too much,5
had a great flight the cabin crew on japan airlines are beyond efficient and really make the difference,5
cabin services are always excellenthelpful flight attendantalways on timebut only thing that i disappointed was meal even business class meal was not goodtasteless i ate only one bite and didnt touch the rest,4
choosing jal whether its expensive is really value for your money the leg room is quite comfortable and even the seats you have your own monitor to watch movies or tv shows the stewardess are very courteous and organized unlike other international airlines food is simply great,5
i have flown with all the major international airlines at one time or another and have found faults and hygiene problems with all of them the exception is jal i paid economy and got upgraded on the departing flight from sydney to paris and returned paris in economy both classes were exceptional both in service comfort and the cleaniness a also the food was great in both classes i enjoyed an overnight stay with full breakfast included staying at the airport nikko hotel included in the air ticket price i also received a nice meet and greet at the airport in japan the only reason i do not fly with jal is because now i live in queensland and they have cut all their brisbane flights such a shame but with all the health risks involved in travelling its great to have an airline like japan airlines who are way ahead the others when it comes to hygiene and cleaniness,5
best airline to fly to japan same price as american but times better customer service making the reservation and service in the air friendly staff and flight attendants highly recommend once you fly jal youll never want to fly american airlines,5
the upgrade to premium economy was worth it we allowed to use the lounge with free food and drinks comfortable massage chairs etc,5
this was a very enjoyable travel experience for a long flight from singapore to new york via tokyo the flight attendants were wonderful kind courteous helpful the plane was spotlessly clean even the restrooms were maintained well on the long hour flight to new york they did something i have never seen before my adult son was sleeping when they served dinner so they put a sticker on his seat so they would know and remember to offer him food when he woke up they were constantly walking around with water coffee snacks,5
great service and commitment nice food and choices two eggs for a personal breakfast comfortable seat and accessories,5
at booking desk we were upgraded to premium economy which was a very pleasant surprise we flew from melbourne to narita as in economy and were well looked afterand reasonably comfortable the return flight in premuim was a very nice experience indeed arriving feeling very fresh i would highly recommend jalfor the for the level of service they provide,5
ive been using japan airlines for more than years at least twice every year the conversion point of the mileage isnt good at all but the rest of the service is great i usually try to avoid using a bathroom which men and women have to share but with hours flight you cant avoid i like the fact that i see flight attendants go to the bathrooms so often to keep them clean all of the time from the checkin counters in the lounge at the boarding and on the plane people treat you very nicely most of the time the flights are on time,5
excellent flight service and timing the best airline ive travel with even the economy class is much better than others the only thing that was difficult is that on my way back they had an alliance with an airline from malasya and it was very difficult to check in online and to find the flight at delhis airport,4
having flown jal to japan and the united kingdom on several occasions my experiences have been very positive the airline is reliable efficient and has a good safety record its cabin crew are courteous and helpful in every possible way in the past i flew on a number of airlines but none met the standards of jal their performance is second to none,5
what great servicewe can not speak highly enough about the attendantswould use them again in a flash,5
the crew was super attentive the meals were okay i dont think airlines should try to do gourmet keep it basic and tasty fancy restaurant style just doesnt prepare well in the air just saying i did appreciate the double menu western and japan types of food i am over tall and when i fully reclined my feet pressed against the foot rest not good for hour flight from tokyo we took at a great leg room tight on the shoulders only hours so it was tolerable looking to stay away from the movie selection was pretty good those and a book got me through stars is solid not jal fault for the type of planes they fly,4
st flight with jal from dme to tokyo narita great trip friendly attendants great food and drinks the only cons small lavatory,5
if i am flying to japan only with jal the price is quite reasonable food and overall service is good for economic class and the best of all if there is turbulence the aircraft goes higher where is it less turbulent our flights have been mostly on meters altitude very calm and comfortable this is an extremely important thing for someone who is very y anxious when flying,5
the service is unparallel the food was delicious i have plane food the place was super confortable even for a hour flight great way to fly back from asia,5
the online experience with jal was pretty bad horrendous really i wanted to login to the system and see my reservation but was never able to do that first time this ever happened to me but i read that their economy seats were good and i was pretty confident i was booked as they did send me an email after i inquired i had the most basic of economy seats but everyone at jal had me believing i was a valued customer customer service was better than i expected the seats were better than premium economy on deltaunited the flying experience was better than i could ever recall flying the standard usa airlines i highly highly recommend jal,4
best airlines for flying to asia staff was super friendly and helpful they speak english the flight is comfortable no matter where you sit the food was amazing and service was impeccable my go to airline,5
service was excellent as was the food typical japanese seven course meal for dinner and a very nice breakfast and snack in between seats were adequate with above average leg room considering the price and service level i would not hesitate to flay jal again,5
i wasnt looking forward to such a long flight business class seats were much more comfortable than britishair and united less claustrophobic,5
really great service the flight attendants were very polite neatly dressed and courteous they consistently served meals and were generally available to assist at all times a note of caution though the food tends to be japanese oriented so persons with special dietary needs must advise the airline in advance do not presume that there will be anything to suit special needs,4
the airline as known for its high quality of service i flew more than flights a year and was never disappointed regardless of the flight classes the only improvement i wish is for the quality of tea in business classes as it tastes like the ones from supermarket at low price the airline should tie up with one of the famous brand and serve them,5
my st experience with jal from new york jfk to singapore via tokyo i have a feed back may help you to improve your services i believe,1
japan airlines is by far the best airline i have flown it starts with the attendants who are well dressed and extremely polite the airplanes are spotless and the food is excellent add to that the timeliness of the flights and you have an excellent airline,5
we traveled in november from sydney to tokyo narita airport and back to sydney in japan airlines premier economy class in a nonstop flight the flight was very comfortable our vegetarian food was good and delicious the checkin was smooth and quick we were allowed in qantas business class lounge at sydney airport and in sakura lounge at narita airport the staff in the flight were polite and always attentive,4
took this flight on thanksgiving day fairly crowded but everything was orderly leg room was good food was okay with either japanese or western style had some new movies to watch but choices was limited no big surprises,4
over the last year ive had the privilege of traveling on long haul business class flights with a number of airlines including emirates jal united and british air and jal is the best their plane was the cleanest after hours in the air their beds were the most comfortable and their food was certainly more than adequate if you ever have a choice this is the airline to chose i had a visa problem for my ongoing travel and the jal staff handled it masterfully it was in total a fabulous experience,5
this was my first time on jal and i loved everything from the staff with exceptional service and also the cleanliness the food was superb as you can choose japanese and western the flight entertainment is also good however i did wish their was more movies that were newer releases on the way home i flew premium economy again a fantastic product the service and meals were unbeatable i felt like their was constant food being served with was great the seats were extremely comfy and the barrier on the side of the seats next to the head rest is perfect as it gives you privacy without looking at the person next to you other than that a great product i would recommend anyone to fly with,5
we had a very unpleasant experience on jal and my husband was ordered out of his premium economy seat we flew from tokyo to singapore on th november in a family of my husband was on premium economy class as it was work travel while i and my daughter of yo were on economy normally on long flights my husband and i would swap seat to take turn to look after our daughter we have done this a few times on singapore airline and there was absolutely no issue so today i took the premium economy seat first after two hours i swapped my seat with my husband to put our daughter to sleep however one of the stewardesses immediately ordered my husband out of the premium economy seat and said that no seat swapping allowed we explained our situation and said that the seat rightfully belonged to my husband we apologised and said we would not do it again however she insisted that my husband must return to the economy seat now at this time my daughter was over tired and refused to leave my side so i sat down with her in economy while the stewardess pointed to an empty economy seat far away from our seats and said that he could sit there but not allowed back in premium economy afterwards my husband explained the situation to other stewardesses and they were very sympathetic however they said that the person giving the order is the head steward and they have no say they suggested that if we wanted to we could file a complaint and so my husband did a few hours later my daughter woke up from her nap although we tried asked her to sit with daddy and let mommy sit in the front she refused to and kept screaming i want my mommy when i returned back to the premium economy seat she ran after me with tears streaming down her face asking for me she looked so distraught that i lifted her up and let her sit on my laps and told her that she cant sit here almost immediately that stewardess came back and said to me your daughter is not allowed to sit here i couldnt believe it as the stewardess looked like a mother herself and how could she be so unkind and heartless to ordered a teary toddler right back to the seat so i just looked at that lady and then carried my girl back to economy i asked my husband to go back to the premium economy seat again as this is just absurd he paid for the seat and yet ordered out of his own seat so he did and that stewardess made a big fuss again she even said to my husband i understand that you have filed a complaint about us and so have we we know all your details and i have reported you to our airline now this is just ridiculous my husband was firm but never lost his control or got too emotional at that point he was so frustrated that he just left and to make the matter worse the lady went to apologise to every single customer in the premium economy cabin because of our disturbance in the end we spent the majority of our flight back in economy with the premium economy seat being left empty as my daughter just wanted to be with me and i didnt want her to scream or cry on the plane and disturbed other passengers on top of that we felt so humiliated and discriminated as if we were thieves from economy seat trying to steal a seat from premium economy had the crew members told us from the beginning that no seat swapping allowed we would have definitely sat in the correct seating we felt discriminated because in the same row of premium economy seat one passenger kept swapping back and forth between business class and premium economy he is a huge man and hence i noticed it when he walked down to sat next to his wife in premium economy so that very man was allowed to go back and forth but not us later on when we complained about the differential treatment to the ground staff in singapore we were told because the man was on business class he could switch however he wished to and because we are on lowly premium economy we are not allowed to do that i really really liked jal and would always have only good things to rave about this airline however after this incident we are very scared by the airline and we are seriously want to avoid this airline forever,2
its very confortable airline from japan to singapore departure time is set before noon and arrival time is before evening so its convenient for me especially for the business traveller time consuming viewpoint this flight schedule is very good in flight service is an acceptable level both foods and drinks cabine is clean and there is no claim on this,5
i flew jal for the first time and was very impressed by the service and cleanliness the economy seats were comfortable as far as economy goes there was a variety of tv and movie selections the food was good by airline standards i would recommend jal for long haul flights,5
nice friendly and helpful flight attendance the food was good and looks healthy comfort seat and spacey,5
its my nd trip to japan by jal this time my family of travel in premium economy class sadly theres isnt priority for boarding unlike sq also the stewardess didnt ensure that all windows be up when landing though they walk through the aisles in fact its my first time witnessing such a scene not worth the price,3
i had a great flight with the jal airlines the check in was smooth and gate agents was very nice and allowed me to board first because i am bringing my child along they also provided seamless good customer service and was always very accommodating and smiley throughout the way i cannot praise this airline enough they also provided cute and nice bento set for my child and even gave a free toy on each way of the flight i definitely will choose to fly with this airline again if i travel to japan again,5
our flight was awesome took off on time and was very pleasant the flight attendants provided us with outstanding service i would highly recommend this airline,5
i tried st time with jal since i had a good impression with japan and people but really regret because of communication attitude in new york office specialy food and other stuff only i am happy with cabin crew tey are realy helpful,1
arrived at jal first class lounge at narita around pm for my pm flight and the lounge was not too busy however by pm the lounge was packed and lounge staff had to make announcements apologizing for the condition of the lounge and asking guests to share tables this is becoming a frequent experience with the jal first class lounge in the main building of terminal at narita as the second floor of the lounge is closed for renovations thereby reducing seating significantly having travelled through several times in the last couple of months i have found the first class lounge often to be not relaxing and peaceful at all but instead overcrowded and difficult to find an empty table or seat it does fluctuate through the day so whether one will have a good experience in the lounge will depend on your luck the first class lounge in the satellite building may be better since it is not under renovation yet so if you are unsure of where your gate is you may be better off going to the satellite building first class lounge instead of the main building first class lounge i left a bit early for my gate as i know jal is very prompt with boarding and as i have priority boarding with my one world status i was one of the first to board after the infants and assistance boardings and was quickly settled into seat k window seat in the first row on the right hand side of the plane business class was completely full on this flight so overhead bins were quite full this is particularly the case for the bins over row since there are no bins over the two seats in the middle section of row xx configuration jal uses a b dreamliner on the route but installed shell flat neo seats so it is not fully flat bed and the window seat passenger does not have direct aisle access however in row there is no cabin with the entertainment system in front of your seat so it is much easier to step over the aisle seat passenger window seats are also more attractive on the b than other planes because of the significantly larger windows giving views that would not be possible on another plane eg view more directly straight down below the plane as usual jal served great food on the plane generally the japanese meal is more substantial and more interesting and delicious than the western offerings so i chose japanese meal for my dinner and it was delicious starting with a bento box with different starters and then two mains served with rice i saw a salted chocolate dessert on the western menu that sounded more interesting than the dessert offered with the japanese meal asked whether i could have the western dessert instead and glad that this change was possible for the breakfast served hours before landing i opted for the western meal for a change it was described as a salmon cake more like a salmon patty and turned out to be served with some nicely cooked pasta not soggy it was delicious and i was very happy with my choice despite the short hour flight and the angle flat seats i managed a good hours of sleep as jal was quite efficient with dinner service finishing about hours after takeoff and then also waking up the cabin hours before landing for breakfast service in terms of weaknesses jal does not have a great entertainment system and the choice of movies is not very broad other than hollywoodenglish language movies jal does also offer movies from china vietnam thailand india etc but those only have subtitles in japanese english language movies though can be viewed in a number of different languages with subtitles in a number of languages a negative of row seats is that instead of a large entertainment screen in a console cabinet in front of your seat you have a small screen that pulls out of the center armrest the other weakness is that jal does not provide any seat covers or other special bedding to improve sleep and the duvet that is provided is very light and not very long so a tall person will struggle to be fully covered nevertheless i always highly recommend jal business class as it is priced very well and the service and food are always excellent the washrooms are also in much better shape throughout the flight than with other airlines as cabin crew frequently tidy up the toilets after use,4
for some reason jal do not operate the boeing dreamliner on the narita to lax route and still use older s they fly into san diego with the at the same time departurethat was the only negative as the boeing is not as comfortable as quiet or as new as the s food service and quality was good and better than most other airlines staff are always friendly and service orientedthe flight left late but arrived on time and baggage arrive intact and relatively quickly,4
despite being in economy there was plenty of legroom convenient as i live in kona and the flight is direct meals were excellent with premium big island candy cookies and onolicious ice cream i cant imagine what first class is like frequent tea or drink service and snack before arriving in narita free movies as well lots of new movies to view great service and food,5
we decided to fly from tokyo to osaka before flying home to brisbane on the last leg of our journey we had not flown jal before and were pleasantly surprised at the amount of leg room we had especially comparing it with some of australias airlines the staff were ever so friendly and accommodating the food was delicious with a japanese and western meal offered we were so impressed that we will now look at flying with jal again especially when we travel overseas,4
my child has a nut allergy and i had advise the airline they were very thorough in their questions in what i need to know about what food rad being served and very aware of her allergies i definitely recommend them as we were very happy with the service,5
this is a good service that links melbourne with tokyo despite the am departurethe only benefit is the ability to get into tokyo early am the aircraft is a boeing and new and clean the staff are always pleasant two benefits over the alternative carrier qantas is a lower price and better food and service,4
terrific service from checkin at los angeles to arrival at kansai airport flight attendants were extraordinary and provided superior customer service and attention if i am fortunate enough to return to japan i wouldnt fly with any other airline japan airlines earned a star rating from me for every aspect of the flight even the food was terrific,5
i took the jl flight from vancouver to narita again which i have done many times before but this time encountered unusual boarding confusion at vancouver there seemed to be people lined up and milling around the boarding pass reader lanes in all directions and jal did not do as good a job of keeping things organized as they usually do that said part of the problem may have been the unusally high number of passengers travelling with infants and young children several wheel chair boardings and at least seniors who needed assistance preboarding as a result of the boarding chaos the plane was a bit late pushing off at around pm there was a long taxi with many planes ahead of us waiting for takeoff so takeoff was not until pm or so but nevertheless we landed around pm slightly ahead of the scheduled landing time of pm that is one thing that i have found in numerous flights on jal they tend to be very good on departing and arriving on time and punctuality is a trademark for the airline the flight was operated using a beautiful b dreamliner but outfitted with angleflat seats in the neo shell flat seat series i took seat k as the larger windows on the dreamliner really make the window seats attractive and with no seats in front of me there was not the usual entertainment screen cabinet to make stepping over the aisle passenger next to me tricky as with other rows row also gives a good vantage point to watch on and quick access to the washroom at the right front of the cabin which many business class passengers overlook in favour of the two washrooms between the two sections of the business class cabin as i had flown the route recently i opted for the western meal instead of the japanese meal i had before for my lunch the beef tenderloin in red wine sauce was good but it does not compare to the excellent japanese meals on jal row seats do not have the larger screens in a cabinet in front of the seat and has instead smaller screens you have to pull out of the center armrest entertainment system was never a strength of jal anyway so i did not mind the smaller screen tradeoff for the huge picturesque window notwithstanding the angle flat configuration i did get a few hours of decent sleep before cabin attendants woke the passengers about hours before arrival for breakfast another little hiccup i had related to my checked luggage i was connecting to a cathay pacific flight the next morning at am and asked if jal could check through my luggage since they are both one world alliance partners and as the cx flight can also be purchased on jal as they are code share partners on the flight i was told by vancouver check in staff they could not check through and i had to pick up my luggage and check in with cathay at tokyo narita however when i failed to see my luggage delivered in narita and checked with ground staff there they pointed out my luggage receipt actually said hong kong so apparently my luggage was checked through anyway i checked with jal upstairs in departures again to be sure and they explained that they can check through for flights departing within hours of my arrival on jal a couple small hiccups on this particular jal flight but will stick with the airline for the route as it is competitively priced to hong kong compared to air canada and cathay pacific and service and food are excellent,4
i took the short haul flight from haneda tokyo to itami osaka on jl in jclass which is the domestic business class i arrived at the airport about minutes before my flight used my one world elite status to use the very efficient first class checkin and then the dedicated security entrance and lane for first class passengers and top level frequent flyers located just to the left of the checkin counter the whole process was extremely efficient friendly and a surprisingly nice touch for a short haul domestic flight the dedicated security lane was very quick with no line ups so within minutes i was into the jal diamond premier lounge the lounge was huge and the decor was stunning for a domestic level lounge pass the reception desk there is a luggage storage area with keyed lockers to store your carryon including handy roll in ones at the bottom for your roll on board past the storage area and then washrooms is the entrance to the main lounge to the right there was a dining area with some basic foods on offer corn soup miso soup some breads including a curry bun referencing the famous curry that is served in jal international lounges and two kinds of rice cakes then to the immediate left an open seating area with seats that are well designed with a privacy screen between seats and a built in storage area next to the seat for your carryon and finally to the far left a larger seating area with individual cubicles that are very private the cubicle walls are high enough that from the entrance you cannot see the occupants of the cubicles at all equipped with a comfortable arm chair and a little pedestal table the level of comfort and size of the domestic lounge at haneda puts the jal narita first class lounge to shame so hopefully the renovation that has begun on the second level of the first class lounge for jal at narita terminal main building will result in a revampt of that the seating areas in that lounge to at least match the domestic lounge i had to try the curry bun since it is featured in the jal website description and it was very good not very spicy at all my lounge stay was thoroughly enjoyable the flight to itami boarded on time minutes prior to the flight for this domestic flight jal has a small first class cabin with lie flat seats and serves a hot meal even during the short flight for business class or jclass in domestic speak the configuration was on the b i had seat c the bulkhead row right at the door where the second airbridge connects during boarding it was a bit inconvenient as passengers entered right in front of your seat but during flight it was a good seat as the passenger next to you does not need to step over you to get to the aisle and there is unlimited legroom to stretch out the jclass seats recline a bit and also have a leg rest that extends up a bit but only useful if you recline your seat as well as the leg rest does not actually touch your legs or support them when your seat back is not reclined at least for an average height person no entertainment system on this short flight other than music channels at your seat actual flight time is less than an hour so there is not much time for anything other than a simple drink service the flight arrived on time and exit out out itami airport was quick the gate was very near the baggage claim area there was a short wait of a couple of minutes for luggage there are windows in the baggage claim area and i could actually see the luggage containers being removed from our plane and then being driven over below the baggage claim area and then i was quickly out to take the limousine bus with its cheap frequent service to osaka city center transit from itami to osaka is only minutes about half the time that it would take if you flew into kansai airport instead a good domestic business class flight offering that is only slightly more expensive than economy worth it for the less crowded jclass cabin a more convenient arrival airport at itami rather than kansai and an impressive experience at an unexpectedly luxuriously fitted first class lounge at haneda airport domestic terminal,5
having suffered from qantas and virgins economy class i chose jal premium economy in nov i think some of the things i got was for business class for the small additional fare compared with economy it is value for money but i am not sure how long this could last here were some good things i got a ticket for speedy custom service there was virtually no queue it took about minutes in total to go through custom including security check then i could use the qantas lounge comfortably seats with free breakfast and drinks the leg room on the plan was more than i expected i estimated that the leg of a person of foot tall could not reach the back of the seat in front on the return flight from tokyo jals sakura lounge provided free dinner and drinks there was another quiet and nice area for people to go on the web or rest most surprisingly i got a pass to use the quick custom service when i returned to sydney while other people were queuing for the self custom service i was already out and my luggage was already on the conveyor belt this is the first time that i did not need to wait for my luggage,5
i usually fly with korean air or air canada to visit korea since my shoulder is not great i decided to use japan airline this time last time i used it was almost years ago i wasnt certain about narita airport for the connecting flight the sign at the airport was great both ways and i had plenty of time to go through security check before the connecting flight food in flight toward pusan was not that great for my taste but on the way back was much better the service was courteous and pleasant i would definitely fly jal if i travel to pusan again if incheon is my destination i would still prefer korean air or air canada,4
i had a long layover at narita before my flight to vancouver so had lots of time to try out all aspects of jals narita first class lounge i arrive shortly after it opened at am and found that it filled up very quickly i had breakfast and lunch in the lounge and there was a great selection of hot and cold food in the buffet the made to order sushi counter was also opened at breakfast it operates am to pm and then again from pm to pm there was a special treat in the lounge on the day i was there jal was introducing some kind of local sweet made with red bean paste and chestnut and in the afternoon there were a number of reporters crowded around the featured sweet taking pictures after breakfast i used the shower rooms to take a shower the shower room is not very large but does have everything you need and a rainfall showerhead and multi side jets in the shower jal is renovating the second floor part of the first class lounge at naritas terminal main building so the lounge was more crowded than usual around am after taking my shower i had trouble finding an empty seat in the lounge luckily the crowd seemed to disappear quickly too so after an hour or two suddenly the lounge was quiet and fairly empty again i came off an overnight flight and wanted to nap a bit in the lounge but found there were very few seats that you could comfortably nap in most have low backs jal used to have massage therapists giving short back massages but stopped that a couple of years ago choosing instead to rely on installing more massage chairs i used the massage chair once again on one of the minute programs and it was fairly good but still feels like small bowling balls rolling up and down your back a far cry from the real person massage therapists the first class lounge used to have i went to the boarding gate a bit before the scheduled boarding time as jal typically does board promptly jal has special priority lines for its highest frequent flyer levels and offers the same privilege to one world alliance emerald members so i boarded very early and got settled in quickly jal uses a beautiful b dreamliner for the tokyo to vancouver flight but as many have complained continues to use an outdated angled shell flat neo seat it is quite comfortable and actually works quite well but still cannot compete with any of the other airlines or jals own fully flat bed seats service and food as usual were excellent on my flight window seats do not have direct aisle access and window seat passengers have to step over the aisle passenger which can be a bit tricky balancewise when the aisle seat passenger has fully reclined into an angle bed mode however in row there is no cabinet with the entertainment system in front of the seat the screen is pull out from the center armrest so the window passenger can step over the aisle passenger much more easily even if the seat is in angle flat bed mode with the much larger windows that the b offers this is one plane that makes it worthwhile to select the window seat even if it means less convenient indirect aisle access flight was on time departing and arriving jal is behind the times with its angle flat seats on this route but makes up for it with superior food and service,4
took the morning flight from haneda to itami and was surprised that it was a huge plane and it was full service was good and staffs were friendly all the way checkin was smooth at the airport and arrival was good thinking of using jal for next international trip,4
what a wonderful airline great service and wonderful food really wonderful id endure the long flight again to eat the food we also came back narita to ord and it was again wonderful they even have wrapped toothbrushes with toothpaste in the bathrooms,5
very clean very efficient excellent and friendly service no complaints at all will def use jal again,5
what a great airline the check in and boarding process was swift and efficient the flight attendants were exceptionally considerate kind and professional the food was terrific and the airline has a heart i requested all aile seating on my flights because of certain medical issues that require me to have easy access to a restroom jal was happy to accommodate me and they did on all flights in advance when i got my boarding passes for my return flights i was told they were all aisles great when on the last and longest flight i discovered that i was not on an aisle i mentioned our arrangement to the flight attendant at first after looking she said there no aisle seats available then when i explained the situation to her and even mentioned that jal had a copy of my doctors note on file she left then came back and said she had one aisle seat available and would move me after take off which she did to an aisle seat with leg room and next to an empty seat i was in passenger heaven jal is the best in my book an airline with heart,5
i took the overnight flight on japan airlines from bangkok to tokyo narita when i checked in i was requested to use a third party lounge rather than jals own sakura lounge until after pm as they said the lounge would be too busy with other earlier overnight jal flights however when i got to the lounge they said it was not overly busy so they admitted me anyway eventhough it was earlier than pm the lounge was pretty packed but there were still seats and table available near the dining area i wanted to eat dinner in the lounge and go to bed after the flight takes off as it was an pm departure and the flight time was less than hours so there would not be enough time to sleep food offering in the lounge was quite good with lots of variety both chicken and beef curry hamburger steak in tomato sauce clams cooked in kimchi sausage fried chicken a bit of a strange mishmash but definitely substantial enough for dinner i noticed also that after i finished my meal a few of the food options had been changed after pm the lounge became a lot quieter as a couple of earlier flights were boarding seating is not fancy but it is a good sized lounge with good food offerings for a business class lounge the flight was boarded on time as is usual for jal the flight was operated using a b fitted with sky suites in business class this is an excellent product fully lie flat great privacy and lots of trays and storage areas to put drinks glasses tablets or phones there is a really clever little storage tray just above and behind your seat with a mesh cover that is handy for charging cords phones and any other small items to be kept safe from falling into the seat sides i noticed that each of the seats has slightly different configuration of trays and storage spaces i had the window seat which is the only one with the storage tray above and behind my seat and by comparison it looks like the window seat has the most usable and useful storage areas i was feeling a bit hungry when i boarded the flight and therefore opted to try the late night sushi snack on boarding cabin crew also asked you to fill out a form indicating if you want to be woken for breakfast and if so your food choice i filled in that i would like the japanese breakfast set as typically the japanese food on jal is better than its western options i did note that while the food is very good it was noticeably inferior to th earlier flight i took on jal from osaka kansai to bangkok probably because the japan based food caterer is better than the bangkok based one i had a very good sleep during the flight as the sky suite is very comfortable for sleep the flight was scheduled to land am and arrived a little early by the time i walked from the gate at the satellite terminal to the main terminal the first class lounge was just opening at am so the timing was good i enjoyed this overnight flight very much service is excellent and the seat is very comfortabel for sleeping in an overnight flight there was also lots of privacy and with direct aisle access from every seat i was not disturbed in my rest,5
booked the flight without knowing much beforehand and it took us by surprise the little touches made by jal before taking off the crew wave goodbye at the ground with a banner wishing well thats a first time experience what made it lovely was the seafood meal choice that was made available to economy class too and for all seafood lovers pescatarian could be another option staff are polite and helpful generous with amenities when you asked for it the screen restarted a few times and the crew actually mailed vouchers as an appreciation after we got back service standards only downside is the leg room pretty tight for their planes would definitely fly again and recommend jal,4
wow from service to food to legroom everything was tasteful classy and perfect i cannot wait to fly this airline to asia again thank you,5
made a very quick last minute trip from tennessee to singapore on november the flight did not arrive in singapore from narita until am the inbound flight to singapore was nice the regular business class seats that on jal are not the best the service was great and i was able to sleep after a hour flight from dallas to narita the return from singapore days after was much different same air craft but the service was slow i was on seat a window single seatit took more than minutes to get something to drink had to ring the attendant bell several times to get someones attention it was the same for the lunch service slow and no sense of attention to the customer at least that is how i felt on another note their intercom announcements are excessive and disturbing it is hard to see a movie with the amount of constant interruptions that have no significant meaning next time i will take my i pad with my own movies to that i dont have to hear the a flight attendant that loves to hear her self talk out of for jal,3
we are just at the end of a trip around the world and in the process have flown a number of airlines on different international routes of all the airlines that we utilized this japan airlines flight was the very best that we have experienced boarding was very quick and efficient directed by immaculately dressed and very polite personnel the seating was comfortable and although in economy class almost roomy the food excellent and the service throughout the nine hour flight most attentive as an added treat there was a japanese breakfast that provided a most authentic taste of the real japan hats off to japan airlines for a job very well done,5
i joined a group of friends traveling to japans northern island of hokkaido for a holiday as the flight was short and we were holidaying we elected to buy the cheapest tickets available which we located on vayama one thing that i appreciated was the rather generous baggage allowance for such reasonably priced tickets kg per passenger arrival and checkin at tokyos haneda airport went smoothly and we had time to grab lunch before boarding clearing security was very efficient with a minimum of delay or hassle very different from the usual tsa rigmarole and boarding was swift and orderly the aircraft was a boeing and seating was i found my window seat to be comfortable enough for a hm flight and the plane was very well maintained take off was on time and soon we were flying high over honshu while there is insufficient time for meal service in economy class a complimentary drink was offered and appreciated arrival was slightly delayed due to weather but japan airlines acquitted itself handsomely with the quick delivery of our baggage all in all the good efficient and courteous economy class service of japan airlines is fine especially for rather short domestic flights in japan,4
cozy seat and nice meal especially japanese set lunch and sake in business class you can order your nd meal anytime from your seat video controller you do not need to call flight attendant this system is very convenient,4
are we glad that we booked jal business class for our return bkknrt flights both flights were on time the food and service were up there with the absolute best in the sky the cabin and seating were spotlessly clean the flight attendants really made the journey that much more special with their attentiveness and friendliness nothing was too much trouble and all delivered with genuine and sincere smiles the seating outbound was the shell flat neo which was perfectly adequate and the return leg was the impressive sky suite boasting a lcd monitor we should add that the sky suite is the best business class product weve ever had the fortune to be seated in we very much look forward to flying with jal again in the future,5
this is little late as we travelled oct but due a stroke on return it has taken some time to get this written more to follow on our trip to japan first time booking frist with any airline but this was a special trip and a surprise for my wife we were directed to the private checkin area and boarding passes issued very quickly we were then exported through a private security screening and then straight into the first lounge the facilities were amazing the flight was called and we headed to the gate boarded first as pax offered champagne nice touch the fight hours a hit towel before lunch service a hot meal and more champagne the cabin service director welcomed us by name and ensured are journey and requirements were taken care off absolutely spectacular crew who all spoke english the food and beverage were excellent,5
flight was smooth and aky was cleanand blue and everything was in order and we had a great short flight,4
initial flight was from shanghai to tokyo and i had to change planes to get to la the plane was almost an hour late in leaving shanghai and i was going to miss my connection in tokyo i asked the flight attendant about it and she said not to worry when i arrived in tokyo a woman from tokyo airlines was waiting for me with a sign with my name and escorted me to security and then to the gate for my flight to los angeles and i made my connection on japan airlines without any problems it was superior service and stress free it was my first time flying japan airlines i usually like to fly qatar airways when if fly overseas i am from the usa i was pleasantly surprised and would fly with japan airlines again,4
very nice the foods was good the staff always asking you what you want and i will fly again via jal from narita to manila philippine the best airlines and hoping next time they give souviner for their passenger i heard some of the passenger they ask can we bring this blanket,5
legroom was spacious and food was nice it was really a good welcoming feeling to fly for a holiday to japan staffs are nice both on board and at the checkins,5
i flew economy plus from boston to tokyo on the very comfortable and spacious seats with a large monitor and usb charger the staff was excellent and attentive the food was also very good one of the best flight experiences i have had in a while close to hours but very comfortable,5
when flying to south east asia you have many options for me it will always be jal premium class for only a few dollars more jal premium class offers many luxuries lounge wider seat with foot rest and separate line for ticketing in all my years of flying i found jal one of the best experiences followed by lufthansa what made this flight stand out was the combination of professional kind diligent warm attentive but not obtrusive service this premium class flight was booked through american airlines and was less expensive then most airlines flying to hanoi,5
what i admired most about japan airlines jal was their staff whether it be at the checkin at the gate or in the cabin they were all wonderful kind courteous and helpful it makes me wonder why other airlines cant be like jal their inflight meals werent great and movies on offer were not good either but these minor deficiencies were all overshadowed by marvellous hospitality shown by the staff their website is not user friendly and online check in was impossible if jal can rectify these shortcomings they could easily be one of the top airlines in the world,5
flight attendants were very attentive to our needs the food was awesome flight was smooth even though we were seated at the back,5
i flew business class from guangzhou can to tokyo hnd on japan airlines jal the flight was on a boeing i selected jal based on lowest price excellent value for money for the business class airfare time of day departure and the nonstop direct service i departed from guangzhou instead of shenzhen as the price was less by about rmb my seat was very comfortable and roomy and the cabin service was impeccable very friendly japanesegraceful attentive and helpful the food quality was very good and the portion just right for me inflight entertainment options were average,4
this is our first experience with jal we expect good service simply because it is a japanese airlines but the services we received are beyond our expectations flight attendants are friendly and cheerful cabin is clean and comfortable food and beverage is ample and delicious this made our hour flight from lhr to hnd totally pleasant and enjoyable we look forward to another flight with jal highly recommended,5
the sakura lounge level at narita international airport was huge and the service amenities were awesome plenty of beverages snacks best place to chill until my flight gate jl was ready for boarding my seat k was already prepped with an amenity kit a blanket a pillow and noise canceling headphones i definitely enjoyed the nice headphones since i didnt have one myself the amenity kit was great for a short redeye flight i also got slippers a shoehorn the entertainment selection was uptodate and had western asian options the seats had a comfortable adjustable headrest a padded seatbelt i had a ton of leg room a leg rest an adjustable footrest and a center divider for some privacy ive never sat in an airline seat with so many footrest options the seat was also wide instead of reclining backward it reclined forward so that it doesnt disturb the person sitting behind me cabin crew was attentive friendly jal premium economy seats were a huge upgrade from the economy seats i have sat in jal economy seats and the premium economy seats were a million times better i would definitely fly jal premium economy again,5
i am so glad i quit flying emirates and i gave jal a try the service in economy class is simply stunning all these new middle eastern airlines can do what they want their flight attendants are simply not up to the job in addition the boarding is super smooth unlike the madness at dubai airport or in doha on jal the flight attendants show the amazing tradition of hospitality of japanese and the food is excellent even the japanese snacks during the meal services are great,5
it has been a very long time since i flew jal over years and i have to say ive been utterly impressed by the excellence of the service way above sq and cathay pacific the cabin is pleasant but the food is really the best ive ever had in economy class and the flight attendants are amazing,5
the economy class seats on this flight were very comfortable with lots of leg room compared to other airlines flight attendants were attentive friendly and always smiling i think it must be a directive that they smile every time they talk to you the food was good for an airline full meals and a snack wine and beer are free,5
jals newest aircraft has configuration in its business class and offers great convenience all isle access and comfort full flat and side table for longhaul flights japanese food is great with nice chardonnay wine elite member has access to cathay lounges which are the best by far at the hongkong airport,5
we booked business class on this our first trip into japan on japan airlines seats h and k as soon as we sat both seats reclined back too far into an uncomfortable position the flight attendants recognized this was a problem and called for technicians to fix our seats they quickly arrived and without even examining the seat simply said in broken english normal very normal and walked off the aircraft there were lots of smiles and apologies from the flight crew but no action i have flown around the world a couple of times and i know what a business class seat or any aircraft seat should feel like in an upright position it should not feel like i am lying down the flight was just over a couple of hours and my old back took a beating but i must say the flight crew were gracious and attentive,3
every year for my satogaeri trip to japan we have travelled to and from narita but this year we have decided to travel back to the uk via haneda using jal just on the inbound flight our outbound flight was by finnair before this i flew with jal before but operated by finnair or ba i think and didnt get a good trip this time i flew back from haneda to london heathrow with jal operated airline my honest opinion was that on the whole i did enjoy the trip back to the uk this time and the services ranging from airline food inflight entertainment system and so on were good legrooms the most important of all for me was the legroom on the economy seat as everything depended on it for the duration of hour flight which would be bound to cause extra strain on myself as i age on all annual trips to my relief jal operated fleet does provide a good and wide enough legroom for economy class seats so i was very pleased with it even with the reclined seat by the person in front of me this time again i still had enough leg room to stretch my legs which was good but the only snag was the reclined seat got me a shorter distance between the flight entertainment screen and my eyes and i had to keep my head away from the screen to give me the right distance for correct angles and viewing the tilting of the screen didnt help me in this case flight meals i think jal were quite generous in providing more than sufficient amount of meals to passengers on this flight jl i think i have an average appetite just like other people but the long haul flight can influence my appetite quite easily too on this flight i did enjoy the meal that was served first after the takeoff from haneda the choice of meal was adequate it was either beef or chicken dish with rice and i chose the latter and enjoyed itbut it was quite a heavy meal with good amount of rice and chocolate mousse as a desert we were also provided with a small pot of hagen daz ice cream after that the meal was served really quickly and all the food with trays were removed swiftly afterwards then about half way through the flight journey we were woken up again by serving of another light mealwhich proved to be quite heavy for my stomach it was a oval shaped bun with tuna mayo filling i love tuna mayo but my stomach was still digesting the previous meal when this was served hours later but being a glutton for food i couldnt refuse so i consumed it which turned out to be a bad mistake then about hours before the landing we were served for the final time another supper my stomach was still full with previous two course meals in it but i couldnt say no to this meal either as jal was serving 吉野家の牛丼 which i never had before as a flight meal i dont know what non japanese passengers thought of this last meal but i was quite intrigued by this meal as this company yoshinoya was ubiquitously known in japan like macdonalds in early s i think selling their best selling product beef bowl with rice gyudon and i never had a chance to eat any of their product until this flight timing was unfortuante though as my palate was somewhat paralysed with full stomach which struggled to operate and i could just taste the beef and egg sauce all i remember in this flight was feeling queasy and full stomach air circulation and temperature within the aircraft the only thing i would seriously complain in this trip was about this matter i noticed quite a number of passengers were sneezing several times and i found the temperature in the aircraft really hot in fact for the whole journey i was feeling really hot and regretted i should have come in with short sleeved shirt i wonder if i was one of the few passengers who experienced hot air during the whole journey inflight entertainmment system the selection of entertainment was adequate for me i would normally read a book or listen to my own personal audio player anyway so i didnt miss much even if there werent enough choice in the flight system but i think the improvement was made for the touch screen system i wasnt keen on this screen when it was first introduced because if you had a passenger behind you who would use the touch screen in rocky manner heshe would simply punch the screen to select deselect each time and i would be the victim of being punched at the back for the whole hour journey that would be my nightmare it did happen to me once with codeshare flight however on this journey i only felt some light tap a few times from behind and hardly noticed it most of the time or maybe i was lucky to be seated with a very considerate passenger behind me overall this trip from haneda to london heathrow was good and pleasant despite the lack of sleep as i always experience on every long haul flight the only other comment i would make is about the seating plan in this flight the fleet had a seating plan of left centre right seats in most rows in economy class at the checkin counter we both wanted aisle seats and we were told that we would get aisle seats as there were two seats but when we got into the aircraft we realised we were allocated one aisle and the seat next to it middle seat we didnt minds getting two aisle seats with front and back and i think the jal staff who served us possibly misunderstood us but we relatively had a good and almost problem free flight on this trip so we would certainly consider jal to be one of the possible candidate flight carrier for our journey next year we have used finnair for the past few years and their service has been equally good too but with the brexit situation in the uk yet to be settled we would have to find out what each airline could offer next year,4
i flew from sydney to narita and then on to jfk its a long flight but jal is a good choice the seats in premium economy are a little bit bigger than the economy and the cabin crew were delightful flying premium economy allows you to enter the lounge which is nice,4
one of the best airlines service was great their flight attendants are very accommodating i felt relaxed during our flight from manila to tokyo,5
jal is my choice of airline when i travel to asia service is great from check in counter to crew on the plane,5
i just flew from toronto to tokyo with air canada and then tokyo to bangkok with japan airline the service and experience was night and day difference japan airline even offered very delicious meal very happy with japan airline and even the flight attendants are so cute,5
when youre on a flight of hours one would expect a comprehensive selection of movies what a disappointment i know we were on an old plane i think but thats no excuse for jal not to download some current movies applicable to the demographic of its business class customers the staff were friendly but their service was a reflection of lack of numbers the food was average to poor quality jal must be into some serious costcutting exercises we hate to think how bad conditions in economy might have been,2
premium economy seats the nonstop flight on a and the always smiling and always helpful crew has turned me into a japan airlines advertisement,5
comfortable and full equipment seats make passengers relax staffs in nice uniform and manner look neat all services are attentive and helpful safety mind comes first especially checking overhead luggage compartment throughout the long flight it is worth for money and time,5
most comfortable economy seats ive ever seen the configuration also meant not having to clamber over someone to go to the toilet like everything japanese everything was as advertised although we were late taking off arrived slightly early,4
this is a great company i had two checkedin luggage places included by default in my ticket extremely convenient and not expensive they could have better variety of films and free wifi on board cmon it is st century but everything else was perfect the jet was brand new to make the window dark each window had a button with smart glass extra cool also the service was greaet,5
this was our rd trip to asia on jal every trip was a pleasure to travel on this airline service is great seats are roomy and one can do hour flight comfortably food was good only thing needed little more selection of food at their lounges in asia we highly recommend this airline,5
i originally started my journey in kuala lumpur but this review is about my flight from narita to lax on jals i had a tenhour layover at narita so journeyed to shinjuku and spent a few hours wandering when i returned to the airport i found my way to the fast track security and i was airside in about minutes being a j class passenger youre afforded access to the wonderful sakura lounge for those in the know however you also have access to the admirals club cathay pacific lounge and the qantas business lounge if youve the time i highly recommend loungehopping the qantas lounge is super quiet since their flights are redeyes when i checked in in malaysia the agent asked if i wanted an aisle seat instead of middle i declined because i read the middle seat is actually very private when i checked in at narita the agent also asked if i wanted an aisle instead of middle trust me for this flight youll want a middle seat boarding promptly began at in such an orderly fashion boarding begins with passengers with children and those that need extra time then first class and upper tier mileage bank members can board followed by business class on their there is a forward intimate biz class cabin there are only seven seats in this area i highly recommend you secure a seat in this forward area flight attendants came round with welcome drinks and i helped myself to some champagne while it doesnt seem like the middle seat provides much privacy once the dividers go up youre in your own little world whats also great is you still have aisle access after takeoff cabin crew came round to take meal orders i opted for the japanese menu and a lovely sauvignon blanc i love jal cabin crew because theyre not only friendly but theyre incredibly gracious i highly recommend the japanese meal its beautifully presented tasty and the ingredients are topnotch i really enjoyed the root vegetables simmered in broth after the meal service youre able to order snacks from your seat why dont more airlines offer this technology i ordered a katsu sandwich udon soup and ice cream my flight attendant brought it out about ten minutes after i ordered it my only one complaint is i found the entertainment to be lacking while there are new movies on board i didnt have much interest in them though i enjoyed the japanese movies sadly our hour flight came to a close we landed and taxied to our gate i paid for this oneway flight highly recommend jal,5
nice food drink and service recommend crystal champagne blue tea 磯自慢sake food japanese food is priority i have to say i am so lucky to have all crews to serve me and another customer at first class 美妙的一趟日航頭等艙之旅 我選了日式餐點這絕對是首選 我幾乎忘了使用機上各種設施 因為能在一萬英哩高空享受米其林星級的餐食夫復何求,5
i tried an overnight flight on jal from osaka kansai to bangkok departing past midnight at am and arriving at am i was a bit worried about the overnight flight as the flight time was not very long and i was worried about getting enough sleep to be functional on arrival my worries were misplaced as i actually slept very well on the flight we departed on time taxied for a while and took off around am and arrived about minutes early at about am jal uses a b dreamliner with angle flat shell flat neo seats while the angle flat seats are of course less comfortable than fully flat bed seats and as the shell flat neo do not give direct aisle access for all seats i found my seat h in the first row on the aisle to work quite well for this flight the flight was completely full in business class and the passenger beside me in k appeared to be quite ill with a cold or flu so he was sleeping even before the flight took off and rarely moved from his seat during the flight on boarding cabin staff distributed breakfast preference cards so passengers can select whether to be woken for breakfast and what they wanted for breakfast i selected being woken for breakfast and the full japanese breakfast set soon after take off i reclined my seat to its full angle flat position and slept soundly for about hours out of a slightly less than hour flight time because of the time of the flight eventhough business class was completely full and there were children in the section it was very quiet throughout the flight about an hour and a half before landing i was gently woken with a pat on the shoulder for my breakfast i regret not having collected my senses to take photos because the japanese breakfast set tray was simply stunningly beautiful in presentation even small pieces of vegetable were carved into the shape of a maple leave and colored to give a more beautiful presentation to the meal not only beautiful the breakfast was also delicious especially memorable was one of the many starters offered in the bento box which consisted of a slightly more solid tofu with a wasabi sauce topped by a couple of shrimps the wasabi added just the right interest to the tofu prior to arrival cabin attendants distributed priority lane passes to all business class passengers allowing them to use the very fast no lineup priority lanes for immigration at suvarnabhumi airport my suitcase was delivered within a few minutes of my arrivingn at the baggage carousel and i was out to meet my ride within about minutes of the doors opening after landing,5
i took a domestic connecting flight from narita to osaka itami airport on jal and was pleasantly surprised that jal chose to use a b with sky suite flat bed seats for the short hour or so domestic flight the sky suite is very luxurious and comfortable since it can convert into a flat bed and as it is very private with the seated passenger well shielded from the aisle the configuration is xx with the window seats alternating with the flat console on the window side or on the aisle side i was in a which is the better window seat as the console for my seat was between me and the aisle giving me additional privacy there is a storage cabinet next to me on top of the console and a storage slot under the video screen for your smartphone or tablet sky suite would be a very comfortable seat for a long haul sleeping flight and so for a short haul it was clearly beyond expectations due to the short flight time there was just a simple drinks service which was carried out with jals usual grace and politeness also due to the short flight time there was no video entertainment program eventhough all seats had video screens we departed on time and arrived on time an excellent beyond expectation short haul domestic flight,5
i took the jal afternoon flight from vancouver to narita on a boeing dreamliner configured xx in business class with the two window seats without direct aisle access as the plane was fairly full in business class i opted for seat c since it would be easier for the window seat passenger to step over me because there is no seat in front when i reserved my seat a was unoccupied but unfortunately it was occupied by flight time nevertheless with no seat in front i was not disturbed when the window seat passenger had to step over me to access the aisle the usual complaint applies that jal chose to use a beautiful new plane in the dreamliner for the route but install outdated angle flat seats in business class i slept a little bit on the flight but not deep sleep but i think it was more a matter of the flight time during the afternoon and evening rather than the angle flat seat c does get a bit more traffic passing by it as there is a washroom in front of it past the galley but it was not excessive as there are two other washrooms behind the first set of business class seats the relative ease of step over for row seats is counterbalanced by the negative that your video entertainment screen has to be lifted out of the divider between the two seats and therefore you cannot continue watching entertainment during landing as you are required to stow your video screen as usual service is superb and food is both beautifully presented and delicious there are both japanese and western meal offerings and while the western offerings always sound tempting as well i almost always opt for the japanese meal since they seem to be so much more substantial with many more items coffee on jal in business class is a special blend only offered on flight in business class and it is one of the best coffees i have had in the air so i always enjoy a couple on a flight jal is very good with time management and boarding management so we departed on time and arrived a little early i did have an issue on this flight in that when my priority tagged luggage showed up as the first suitcase delivered to the luggage carousel it was damaged aside from some indentations in the soft sided suitcase the entire pull out handle was missing and there just two wires sticking out of the tubes from which the pull out handle would have been extended i reported the damage to jal and they sent me to jal lost found located outside immigration and customs and next to the domestic checkin desk i told lost found my suitcase was severely damaged and hard to use without the pull out handle and i had a connecting domestic flight to catch in about minutes time they offered me a replacement suitcase but they only have one type in two colors and it was a very solid but very heavy hard sided suitcase weighing more than lbs whereas my usual suitcases are light soft sided suitcase weighing less than lbs i had no choice but to accept the replacement suitcase as my damaged suitcase was not really usable for continuing my trip on the domestic connecting flight so i took everything out of my damaged suitcase and put it in the replacement suitcase luckily the replacement suitcase is a full inch large suitcase so there was plenty of room for all my luggage contents i should mention lost found was extremely polite in handling the problem and thorough in helping double check my damaged suitcase once i transferred all my belongings to make sure nothing was left behind lost found also advised that they would arranged for the destruction of the damaged suitcase once i left lost found then required me to sign a form acknowledging i received a replacement suitcase and told me i would not be able to claim compensation for damage since i received a replacement suitcase i told them i would take up the issue with jal after i get to my destination as i felt it was unfair that i was forced to accept a heavy replacement suitcase that i would not normally buy and be unable to claim for part of the cost of a replacement suitcase similar to the one that was damaged and that would be what i would normally use when i arrived at my destination i did contact jal through their website and initially their response was the same as lost found in denying any compensation because i received a replacement suitcase after some back and forth explanation i am glad to report jal did accept i did not have a choice but to accept their replacement suitcase and that the replacement is not what i would buy for myself or use normally they agreed to compensate me for part of the cost of my damaged suitcase which i accepted as a very fair handling of the situation in summary while i did have an unexpected unpleasant experience of finding my luggage has been severely damaged in transit ultimately jal handle the matter well gave me a replacement suitcase to allow me to continue my travels and made a fair agreement to partly compensate for the damaged suitcase as the replacement was not what i would buy for myself,4
the customer service was at an excellent level the crew is very very friendly the flight was also new nothing to be complained about their service only a couple of points that i had concerns the first thing is the bag holders on the roof was shivering at the take off and landing i dont know if its natural but i was concerned the second thing was that as it was a japanese flight some food was not to my taste other than that i highly recommend this flight,5
we travelled to japan on japan airlines to tokyo the whole experience was excellent check in check on food seats staff efficiency and courtesy were all wonderful highly recommeded,5
very long hrs flight on b dreamliner brand new aircraft comfortable roomy seats for economy premium nice added amenities excellent food service very accommodating cabin crew,4
comfortable and enough space for seat attentive and kind crew movie choices were uptodate special request for diet vegan from osaka itami was carefully attented not the usual food served for vegetarianvegan was different patty with rice and a chocolate cake dessert definitely specially made nd time from singapore to japan and will continue recommended,5
team members were pleasant during check in the sakura lounges in honolulunaritabangkokthe team members at the entrances could be more welcominglounges served very little food compared to other lounges surprised that some of the flight attendants onboard were not more helpful with stowing the overhead luggage powder rooms were well cleaned before another guest enters japanese meals could be tastier the layflat beds would be more comfortable with even a thin padding,4
we flew jal to get to bangkok this was by far the best airline ive traveled on so far others i have used are american airlines steer clear of that oneim american too china southern cathway pacific china eastern korean air and united jal is the best clean lots of leg room in economy perfect and proactive service and friendly authentic smiles i had to fly american on my way back and wished i could have jumped out of the plane with a parachute not really but wished i was back on jal for the return,5
jal have a small number of companion two persons travelling together fares for seniors in business class we have used this method of flying for the past years the flights are during daylight leaving sydney in the morning arriving in narita tokyo in the afternoon an overnight stay in an airport hotel at jal expense leaving the following morning for europe helsinki london frankfurt paris arriving in the afternoon at your destination jal use the latest boeing with very comfortable flat beds the food is excellent both japanese and western the service is great you also get entry to airport bisiness lounges and as a bonus when you look out the window you see a vast snow covered siberia with large rivers and mountain ranges absolutely superb try it you will not regret the experience,5
the journey was a long one hours there and hours back so comfort was key i recommend that if you can afford it you upgrade to at least premium economy if you want to sleep i was travelling with my five year old son overnight for the flight out so getting some sleep was important he slept for about six hours but was very uncomfortable as the seats to not recline much and there was nowhere for him to rest his feet other than on me i did not sleep at all in premium the seats recline more and a footrest comes up in business you get fully flat beds on the positive side however the service on the flight both ways was excellent staff couldnt do enough for us snacks and drinks were left out for us between meals and my son was thoroughly spoiled with toys and a special childs meal which was bigger tastier and more fun that the adults one i cant fault my food though and it was nice to get japanese food there was a decent range of films and tv to keep us both entertained although there could have been a few more childrens films available on the whole i would recommend flying with jal a pretty painless experience for what could have been a hellishly long and horrid flight,4
my alaska airline frequent flyer miles purchased the business class ticket the food and service were subpar and generic the plane landed safely good news the jal flight was my only option when using frequent flyer miles so i did not really have a choice of airlines,3
i was supposed to fly with economy class however for some apparent reason that didnt bother me all seats had been taken up when i arrived for my checkin japan airlines did the favour of escorting me to premium class which i was not expecting at all service or japanese hospitality was charming and nothing out of the ordinary my only advice for the future is to provide halal option there is an increasing demand for this and even the vegetarian option did not leave out foods not suitable for vegetarians and people of religious faiths,4
it was my first long haul flight so i was pretty nervous japan air was absolutely incredible from start to finish the staff on board were incredible and couldnt do enough for you constantly offering drinks and snacks the food was delicious and made me incredibly excited for what tokyo would hold i fell asleep at one point and an air hostess actually turned my tv off and put a blanket on me ridiculously sweet highly recommended,5
i got lucky and got the exit row so i had lots of leg room the in flight entertainment was great with a nice selection of music and movies the food was really good and they had the snacks and drinks flowing what really makes this airline is their employees they are so kind and accommodating i would most definitely fly jal again,5
do not think this airline caters for anybody taller than ft the seats do not recline just the base moves forward food was not to my taste even after staying in japan for weeks eating local food i have no idea what they are thinking serving a burger that looks and has texture of rubberdisgusting,1
the new jal on a dreamliner in a window seat business is as good as many first class offerings noise level low and seats beds excellent and great and nonintrusive japanese service keep it up,5
overall the people were fanatastc and professional the comfort of the cabin seating layout was dated and cold the seats were lay down but hard as concrete and not enough room to lay sideways comfortably the entertainment was also difficult and combursome to navigate the food was marginally better than cafeteria in business class the plane coming from narita to taoyuan was the worst seats i have ever been on it reminded me of my grandfathers broken recliner horrible design and broken seating adjustments jal will get you were you want to go but i hope the review their competition the pillows are so small its comical the blanket is thin as a sheet the details matter in business class other airlines are offer more for the same price,3
the service on japan airlines is simply superb as is the food the equipment on this flight was very modern for example you could darken or lighten the windows by your seat by choosing from a point darktolight dial the flight attendants are exactly that attentive and theyll speak to you in any language you prefer theyll even open the conversation with a caucasian in japanese if thats what he suggests no problems with luggage either it arrived very timely,5
excellent customer service thank you japan airlines for such an amazing customer support a few days before i was facing an issue with my flight cancellation but i literally want to say thanks to this tollfree number for helping me as the experts guided me instantly one of the best customer support till now i highly recommend japan airlines,5
the food was just ok we had trouble understanding much of what the japanese stewardesses where saying the configuration of adjoining seats where not aligned so my wife and i seemed to be artificially separated,4
best company i ever flight delicious food on board cheerful staff very comfortable aircraft check in without any problems and delays,5
aircraft presented well and crew were very friendly took off at scheduled time and landed similarly even it was only an hour flight light refreshments were served along with drinks,5
traveling first class on jal but they dont connect to pretsa system so am waiting minutes in line somehow they dont have a contract so dont fly them until they do,1
excellent outbound onboard service from purser horiuchi hubby went to sleep right of narita and when he woke minutes to landing in honolulu horiuchi was already waiting to serve him is kaiseki meal inbound we were delighted with masako our chief cabin attendant senior sommelier who looked after us very well sky suite beds are definitely an improvement from the sky suite we noticed that window seats have much larger footwells than the middle couple seats avoid the middle seats if you are tall cons again cabin can be on the warmer side bathrooms werent as impeccable as the last time we flew pillows can be more substantial and a mattress pad would be absolutely appreciated,4
i ended up on the flight as part of a trip to hong kong korea and japan this was the last long haul leg and i usually use this leg to adjust back my body clock so good sleep is essential to be fair i make multiple long haul flights a year in either business or first class and with over years of doing this i have seen all the seats and all the levels of service across many airlines so maybe i am just getting picky but this is an old configuration that few still use and on pretty much my favorite aircraft dreamliner this was very surprising these days business is pretty much across in a pod style arrangement with large screen full lay flat and usually a mattress pad etc however this flight was across so you are sitting right next to your fellow flyer no privacy screen and seats that should have been banned years ago these are the seats that recline to about degrees have the hump in the middle and the flip out footrest to catch the continual slide that the angle causes they are by far the most uncomfortable seats ever put in business class and the inventor should be made to sit in one for painful hours every day and then apologize to all flyers who ever used one multiple complaints and grumbling from passengers and it amazes me the japan air considers this acceptable so i did not sleep ended up with back ache and once off the bed of torture swore i will never fly this route with this airline again these seats were so old fashioned they even had the screen that comes out of the arm rest and sits at a crooked angle food was mediocre service excellent stay well away this is just cheap old fashioned seating and cram as many passengers in travel that most abandoned years ago,2
excellent service clean comfort on time and wider passenger seat the stewardess offered us to take our picture it was very nice i love this stars excellent airline for sure i will put in the top priority for flight to japan,5
we asked about an upgrade from economy to premium economy at check in the cost was each sydney to tokyo which we gladly accepted access to the lounge was not included the jal service was impeccable from check in to exiting the plan the seat was very comfy with lots of leg room the configuration was seats across in configuration all other airlines have seats across on the in a configuration really nice food the toilets remained tidy and clean throughout the flight jal is now my favourite airline,5
as is typical with jal it was a good comfortable flight leaving from san diego only one flight a day is easy for us as we live in the area further it avoids the indignity hassle maltreatment and general nastiness of going through lax i regard lax as to nations worst airport as regards service and the connection between domestic and international flights stinks perhaps a bit too much food was served but other than that nothing to fuss about a nice feature is a washlet in the loo which i have not seen on other airlines,4
i have always used japan airlines for japanchina trip i have nothing but faith for the airline great service good meal inflight entertainment and almost always on schedule what more can you ask for the airline if you are travelling to japan try them once,5
when i took flight from tokyo to kona that day was my birthday so clue gave me miniature airplane and some gift with their message it was great memory,5
totally love jal for having flight attendants so polite lots of leg room in the plane everyone have entertainment if front of them and headset is provided the foods are served warm and healthy they sure take good care of their passenger from babies to seniors excellent,5
the food was great and service was good too for a fair price would definitely take again and recommend for others,5
for our first trip to japan we flew with jal and had a really great experience both flights between boston and tokyo going there and coming home were smooth and efficient the crew is very polite and friendly it was one of my most pleasant flying experiences,5
its not exactly business class more like premium economy not very comfortable seats just soft drinks in paper cups,3
its not my first time flying with jali just love and feel safe traveling with this airline that is why i always recommend it to my family and friends,5
i flew from london to tokyo with japan airlines for the first time i have to say i received excellent customer service very attentive excellent quality food and drink although i did find a hair in my meal but they changed it very quickly and i love the fact that the seat dont recline but you can amend the chair up and down avoids any confrontation cabin crew were always on hand to answer any questions they were polite friendly and were very welcoming a typical trait of the japanese i will definitely fly them again as their entertainment system was one of the best ive encountered,5
while it was all so very polite lots of bowing etc the actual service delivery was just average for a start very few of the cabin attendants spoke reasonable english which made communication difficult the magazine had so many languages that i couldnt easily ascertain how some of the equipment worked also the airline seemed to treat their own nationals better than westerners it was impossible for us to preselect our seats and only sterling efforts by our travel agent had us seated reasonably together another couple was not as fortunate being separated by seats and an aisle when one travels in a premium class it is not much different to walking into a restaurant i am used to being offered a drink after i board the plane as happens on all of my other international flights on this flight there was no service for an hour while this might have been acceptable to a passenger starting their trip at narita we had come from berlin and had been travelling for about hours already that said the actual plane a dreamliner was fine and the seat comfortable because flights from australia to almost anywhere the level of service is so important to me and my wife jal failed the test my wife now even wants to fly qantas although she has been critical of that airline in the past,2
got a great deal on japan airlines premium econony as a leg flight from melbourne to london i was excited to see it included lounge access which meant a chance to freshen up in tokyo however even though we booked the whole journey through japan airlines it was only afterwards we learnt the tokyolondon leg was codeshare and a british airways flights this meant no ability to select seats or preselect meals which can be done on british airways it also meant no access to the lounge at narita even though we thought we had booked a jal premium economy ticket because of the codeshare we were not eligible fun to find out when exhausted after hours flight the flight itself id have given stars to great seevice by staff food was okay plenty of room in the seat would have liked a bit more recline and extension of footrest but that was fine got some sleep would have got more but as with all flights there was a crying toddler at least our return flights are all jal so lounge access is fine,3
first time flying jal i was quite impressed and would gladly fly with this airline again the service and value were top i highly recommend this airline,5
the flight was in midnight but all the staffs were nice and friendly the entertainment resources were good with many movies music however its better if they provide english sub to english movies also need more albums of new music,5
bucking the trend here to say the premium economy seat on jals is one of the most uncomfortable seats i have ever sat in whilst the rest of the jal experience was excellent the seat is awful the seat is as hard as nails i was constantly having to readjust my position because i was sliding on the seats fabric when the seat was in the recline position and with no inbuilt foot rest it was nigh on impossible to maintain a position consistent with sleep my bum was numb after hours of a near ten hour flight i wont be flying with jal again which is a shame because the lounge the food the cabin crew were all excellent,2
flight departed on time seats were comfortable im crew was attentive food was great and flight arrived on time,5
it was a long haul from dallas texas to ho chi minh in business class most of all i enjoyed wonderful services the hardware of japan air business class from dallas to narita with private seat but from narita to ho chi minhs unflat seat a in flight and k of flight as expected jal crew deliver top notched service especially ayano takeuchi flight from tokyo to ho chi minh i want japan airline recongnize her genuine personality with professional service most of crews are super excellent but her service was outstanding with fluent english i must point out floor carpet and divider units of are bit outdated and quality of main meal the quality of dinning and limited selections of movie in inflight entertainment must be improved immediately it was worse than previous fly and quite short to meet jals reputations over all i enjoyed and thanks to jals flight,4
i have flown with jal for every japan trip i do both economy and premium economy are wonderful comfortable and convenient i do love the extra leg room for premium though the service is the thing that always stands out for me staff go above and beyond and are always kind and helpful the food is also delicious will always fly jal for my japan trips,5
i had the first row in premium economy class there was a big space from my seat to the wall that separate us from business class i height cm wasnt able to touch the wall with my foot even when reclined cas were graceful,5
ive made this trip many times but this was the best yet for comfort service and promptness cant fault it one bit,5
i was in first class seat g everything about the flight was fantastic i actually flew round trip from jfkhnd and the hnd to jfk leg was much better in terms of soft product the food was a notch better because they enlisted chefs from michelin star restaurants to cater the menu men received a shiseido mens facial care kit in addition to the standard amenity kit and women received some extra facial mask the lotion inside the amenity kit was too fragrant the seat was wide and comfortable we even got to dine together one of my favorite f class products the inflight entertainment system can be better selection was decent but the handset was hard to use,5
love to fly with japan airlines my hours in the sky was amazing the staff are nice the food very good and tasty the inflight entertainment is great just love it,5
i have always heard great things about jal so i was excited to try it for the first time jal was worthy of the hype the staff from ground agents to flight crew was exceptionally courteous and polite waiting at the gate the flight crew passed by stopped turned around and bowed to the passengers before boarding the plane boarding started minutes prior to departure and was so efficient that the plane was backing out of the gate with about minutes to spare there was ample overhead bin storage available even though my family flew economy class there was more legroom than we are used to on american carriers the seats were comfortable as the plane left the gate the jal ground crew on the tarmac lined up waved and then bowed to the plane and its passengersthe food and beverage service was very good much better than we are used to passengers are even given slippers the cabin was clean and there were multiple entertainment options available the inflight service was excellent deboarding the plane was also very orderly and efficient i dont know why boardingdeboarding takes so long on american carriers the flight departed on time actually ahead of time and arrived on time actually ahead of time the service on jal is over the top my family and i are flying on jal again in a couple of months it is definitely worth it,5
first time to travel with japan airlines and i am now a fan cost of airfare is reasonable considering that my checked baggage allowance is consisted of bags kg each staff are courteous and respectful from the time i checked in until the plane landed at my destination for someone like me who frequently travels economy seats are so roomy and entertainment selection is a delight food is fab my stomach and my palate were happy and most important is the restrooms are roomy and very clean with what i have experienced so far would definitely fly with jal again and would recommend it over and over again,5
this was an overnight flight from melbourne in a b it left just after midnight and there was minimal flight service no offer of a turnin hot or cold drink passengers were just tucked up on their very good flatbedsthe is getting s little dated although this aircraft was in tiptop condition in the cabin and the toilets the cabin attendants were reactive rather than proactive all in all a classy operation frayed around the edges,4
my flight was delayed by about an hour but i was able to arrive on time coming back to ny i love the service they were very helpful and respectful you can get full bottle wine and can of beer during your meals i love how they put snacks near the restroom area and you can take as much as you want they served drinks throughout the flight i thought the food on the flight was just ok the portion was a bit small for me i thought they would have some sushi but they didnt i was a bit surprised when they served a hotdog as a full meal i was very hungry still after eating that i wished they didnt turn on the light so much they give out haagodez ice cream the seats were very roomy i love how they made the pillow with a neck rest but they didnt have good movie selection,3
enjoyed every moment of the flight the attendants were professional and their services were just excellent they set the bar very high,5
took the overnight in pa i had preselected my seat but was asked to move to accomodate a family i of course did but it meant being penned in by the window as the fellow passenger went straight to sleep it made for not the best experience i also found the flight warm and quite stuffy but perhaps due to my circumstance tv choices were good i hadnt experienced before not having a takeoff meal there was a notice at checkin re being presented a snack bag on boarding which indeed they did you could also get a noodle cup if feeling peckish overall i think jal offer a good direct service returning in economy on the day flight so will see how that is,4
as a handicapped passenger i couldnt have been treated better at both airports wheelchair service was offered and the handlers were very courteous everything about the flight was very good except the food it was likely good if you like japanese but its not for me,4
my wife and i recently flew business class melbournetokyo it was a waste of money the business class lounge at tullamarine airport was a shared arrangement and quite ordinary the plane cabin layout was cheap looking and the seats narrow sleeping on the overnight melbtokyo sector was very difficult our vegetarian meals were all cold and largely tasteless the only saving grace was the very friendly and efficient cabin staff on top of that not necessarily the airlines fault one of our cases was damaged however dealing with jal ground staff re repairs is inefficient,3
if one remembers singapore airlines inflight service in the old days you would have a point of comparison with japan airlines the inflight service is superb including the food premium economy was completely full as an indicator i asked for a midafternoon snack so the stewardess brought me jals own original udon de sky noodles accompanied by a halfbottle of french champagne,5
jal has amazing staff both on the ground and in the air due to an approaching hurricane all flights in and out of kona were delayed by hours we were expecting that to be the case with our flight too which would have totally upset our plans in tokyo surprisingly we took off right on time and had a very smooth flight thank you jal,4
what a pleasant surprise to be told that our premium economy seating allowed us to visit the sakura lounge at both the melbourne and narita airports almost as nice as the business class lounge the service and quality of the food served on both our inbound and outbound flights to tokyo were outstanding and i found the cleanliness of the bathrooms the best of any airline i flew on,5
its my first time riding jal and im quite satisfied its on time flight crews are very good and always with a smile food is very good if you love japanese cuisineits more than what i expected domo arigatou i will ride it again next time,4
the second experience with jal was not quite as good as the first the outbound flight from bangkok as usual struggles with ground services the business lounge stinks of curry rice not great at the best of times and quite revolting early in the morning the boarding procedure is deficient all passengers use the same to have their ticket and passport checked before entering the boarding lounge at least boarding is separate but airlines need to raise this issue with aot the desk was built to allow two lanes why not use it that way drink service on the outbound commenced hour after take off and meal service about hour and minutes food quality and general service is as different as night from day outbound versus inbound flight information page on vod was not available seat was uncomfortable with limited functionality and not the best if you suffer from claustrophobia or unless you enjoy sleeping in a coffin,4
my friend and i had a most unnecessarily distressing and anxious journey during the first and second stages of our round trip booking with japan airlines my friend is a sixtytwo year old pensioner who suffers from anxiety and depression he has also recently had a bypass and open heart surgery i am an year old pensioner and my friends carer this trip was planned especially to be a relaxing holiday for both of us where we planned to stay with my sister in the united kingdom and then spend four days in tokyo on the way back to sydney australia we booked our flight through italktravel cruise blue mountains australia who sold us the package japan airlines jap jl jl british airways jl jl we accepted this even though on our first stage we would arrive in tokyo at narita hours on august and depart the following day from tokyo narita at hours a stop over of hours our travel agent was quite clear the the package included jal arranging the transfers to and from overnight accommodation paid for by jal the booking also required wheel chair services for my friend on every section of this round trip journey both my friend and i were looking forward to a most relaxing and enjoyable trip to help us recover from all the worry and anxiety we had gone through as a result of my friend having open heart surgery and a bypass operation in april this year at sydney international airport we needed to advise the jal personal that my friend needed to be wheeled from the checkin to the qantas lounge then to the aircraft this was then arranged a short while after takeoff we were given the customs forms to complete these required us to indicate the address at which we would be staying while in tokyo as we did not know which hotel jal had booked us into we told the flight attendants that we expected them to advise us where we were to be accommodated during the stopover this would have been about one hour after takeoff the flight attendants stated that jal never arranged for overnight accommodation for their passengers and that this should have been done by our travel agent we showed the flight attendent our booking itinerary which clearly stated once flights have been ticketed jal will provide confirmation for your stopover the flight attendants insisted that jalnever ever paid for passengers overnight accommodation we explained to the flight attendants that because there was such a long delay between flight jl on th august and flight jl the ba flight on august a stop over of hours jalhad made this package to sell the tickets this constant insistance by the flight attendants that it was not jals responsibility to provide our overnight accommodation caused us extreme distress as we did not know what we could do when we arrived at narita airport we asked if it would be possible for us to use the jal sakura lounge and stay there overnight no this was not possible we were told at no time did any of the flight attendants offer to communicate with jal or our travel agent to confirm what we had believed to be and what were in fact the arrangements fortunately we noticed that wifi was available on the flight we tried to send an email to our travel agent but it failed to go this would have been now some six hours since we boarded the flight we asked the flight attendant why the email could not be sent and were told that we would need to pay for the service having then paid us we sent the email to our travel agent within thirty minutes of our email to our travel agent a jal flight attendant came and apologised and showed us the message they had received the message read to jl re stac pax case the pax already has a hotel reservation harroad international hotel narita twin bwed room pax do not need to pay additional fees thks from nrtoo this confirmed everything we had been saying ever since takeoff why did jal flight attendants not contact jal to confirm what we had said right at the beginning of our journey it would have saved us having all the worry and anxiety for the entire journey so now just before arriving at tokyo we were able to try to calm down however this was not going to be the end of our troubles on the morning of the th august we arrived at narita airport at about hours we went to the jal checkin and inquired about the wheel chair for my friend the jal officer said that this was the responsibility of british airways ba and advised us to go to the ba check in counter we stated that as we had booked our flight with jal it was jals responsibility the jalofficer telephoned ba and then told us that ba would provide the wheel chair service for my friend when we enquired if ba would take us to their lounge we were informed that as we were travelling premium economy with jal we could not use ba lounge we asked if we could use japs sakura lounge and were told that we could not as our flight was with ba we insisted that as our entire trip was with japan airlines this seemed absolute nonsense for if jal had used one of their own aircraft we would be entitled to use the jalsakura lounge again the jalofficer insisted that this was not possible we stated we were prepared to pay for the use of the jalsakura lounge or the ba lounge if necessary again we were informed that this was not an option finally after over one hour of discussion and our trying to reason with jal personnel the jal officer contacted her manager thank goodness that this lady jal manager used common sense to immediately organise a wheel chair for my friend and we were escorted to the jalsakura lounge at narita airport once again we had to suffer unnecessary anxiety and stress for a good hour before the matter was resolved to our satisfaction our entire premium economy round trip from sydney australia via tokyo japan to heathrow united kingdom with return with stop over at tokyo japan then return to sydney australia was booked with japan airlines why did it take so long for japan airlines personnel to provide us with the service we had paid for and expected to receive as premuim economy passengers these flights with japan airlines that we had anticipated being a most enjoyable start to our four weeks holiday became a horrendous and dissapointing experience the food provided by jal was absolutely disgraceful for the price we paid it most certainly did not cater to the european palate the only positive aspect regarding this flight was that the jal premium economy seating was wide comfortable and most satisfactory as the seats were able to recline without encroaching into the space behind our official conplaint to japan airlines with a request to upgrade us for our entire return trip was rejected all we received were apologies and assurances that jal staff were expected to know that jal did infact

i fkew with southwest aa delta aeroméxico avíanca star perú and that far aeroméxico was ok but japan great food excellent service crew good tv do far great at all,4
this is actually update from my previous review on jal and im downgrading it as it did not get any better as i hoped in my view the incabin service is only part of the whole experience and i dont think its too much to ask that if you decide to buy air ticket and fly from a to b it should not be too much hassle well it was a tremendous hassle with jal and im sure will be with anybody if you need anything but just vanilla flight laxtokyo or nyosaka im flying to okinawa hopping there to kume and ishigaki islands as well i have spent many hours for several days trying to book these flights the web site would not allow that multidestination reservation would not work giving some cryptic errors the japan explorer discount program reservation would not work either and when finally i was able to at least reserve trip between tokyo and naha it was more expensive than just regular flight i finally was able to get it done through japanese site guessing on what kanji characters might mean there finally i bought round trip ticket and discovered later on that my return flight is not the same as direct flightit actually goes through the wrong airport and i have to transfer within very limited time frame from haneda to narita and no assistance with transfer is provided nor can i rebook the flight from naha without paying exorbitant fee though multiple flights directly to narita are available on the same date so now i will have a very stressful time and a chance to miss my flight from narita to lax unless paying another for rebooking at the very least the web site could warn customers that particular flight requires transfer waiting on phone whopping hr for customer service does nothing to make the whole experience less unpleasant and to top it off when i filled the contact form on their we site describing my poor experience hitting submit button brought beautiful access denied you are not allowed to email from this server message at this point i could only laugh first time im flying jal and sure the last one all i need is to buy ticket and get where i need to go making it a battle and adventure is not it why did not i choose cathay pacific or singapore airlines a little longer stay in hong kong on the way but judging from my experience no hassle seems i need to learn things hard way if you are like me sure try jal the only reason i rate it stars not one is that inflight service and accomodation is fine though not exceptional,2
this was the second time i took jal the reason it was the second is because the first time was so pleasurable and i could take a jal coded flights all the way through from buffalo to hcmc last year i took jal from kennedy and appreciated the friendliness of the personnel and the efficiency of their boarding once on board the entertainment was sufficient for a halfway around the world flight and the meals on board were surprisingly good who ever thought that texmex beef served aboard a japanese airline would be better that the asian selection consumed by an asian plus narita airport is quickly becoming my favorite place to refresh during a layover after a long flight from now on i m going to try an book on jal whenever i have the opportunity,4
the seats were tiny the air hostesses were like tiny pinyatasbut adorable the geisha girl costume costume worked for me,5
the staff on board the from lax to kix were fabulous one out of four ordered the japanese menu but the western menu of beef was far better the seats on this plane are so hard and so short dont lay flat that the ride was not a comfortable one immigration at kix was not as bad as we had read line moved quickly currently you can only go out of the airport via a train that was a fairly miserable train ride after a hour flight we got off at the first exit to meet our driver but it is very confusing which exit to take therefore taking more time when we were tired if you have a driver meeting you get very explicit directions as how to which exit at the train station drive to kyoto was another hour and a half in hindsight maybe a night or two before osaka before we headed to kyoto would have been better,3
took the flight from singaporenaritasingapore on the er jal skysuite seat is surprisingly wide with good legroom for economy class and even better for premier economy i find it so much comfortable than qatar and sq er which i traveled last year not much comparable on the food though i like the variety of jap beers they offered the services and attitude of the crews make this airline great to travel prompted to requests and always served with great smile show us an excellent customer service we felt your warm hospitality and definitely our first choice for our next travel plan,5
good timing and great legroom great service good timing and great legroom great service good timing and great legroom great service,4
cabin crue very kind comfortable flight good facilities altough in economic class can bring bagage good n nice servis all is good perfect,5
japan airlines has problems but is once again becoming better and better with their customer service food and onboard service is excellent,4
irrespective of which airline wins skytrax or any award japan airlines wins the respect in all categories the crew is awesome helpful curtious and will help you in case of any issues especially food or any other kind i would like to travel with them wherever possible without any other option,5
i travel a lot this was my rd trip to asia so far this year i have taken emirates singapore airlines and american this trip was the worst ever flight on september th food was alfull comfort of the seats was less than average size of seat is fine for a small person but not a foot american most flight attendants did speak english they listed wins on the menu but had of them on board then the white wine was not cold i could go on just flight another airline,1
highly recommended our flight from yvr to narita then narita to manila was such a great experience more leg room and a window seat gave us the comfort and easy flight very friendly and helpful and happy staff,5
very comfortable great service will happily fly this jal again multilingual staff were greatly helpful when selecting food,5
due to some inexplicable snafu we werent able to have our baggage transferred directly to sapporo from tokyo so we had to collect our baggage from london then have it reloaded we had priority collection and then the jal staff processed our ticketing very quickly we made the sapporo flight in adequate time and then had a very enjoyable flight to sapporo we were most grateful that ba and jal recognized our predicament and that they acted promptly to sort it out,5
my flight from narita to bangkok is jal number or american flight i have an aisle seat in coach hopefully it wont be super tight its the next day now it was super tight and hard to even semistretch out i could not even get my computer bag in my seat when sitting there the person in front of me put the seat back and i literally had no room it might have been the most cramped i have ever been on a flight attendants were nice but being cramped so badly didnt help also i am a sapphire with american airlines platinum pro and jal did not even let me pick my seats out i was assigned these seats the day of the flight with no input i dont get this at all i usually fly business or first class and i would have upgraded to business on this flight but was given no opportunity to do thisso on this flight from narita to bangkok there were empty seats in business i would have upgraded for sure if i was given any chance to dobut again i was not from now on i think ill just fly cathay pacific from the usa to asia i am flying back with them when my business is done in thailand and they worked with me several months before my flight to give me the best seats available due to my sapphire status with one world alliance i just dont understand jal and why they refused to work with me they might have just lost me forever,3
my flight from ohare to narita was flight number on japan airline and flight number on american airlines i came very prejudiced to this flight due to the fact that jal would not let me procure a seat prior to the day of the flight i called american and jal the day before i flew and jal said i had not paid enough money for my flight to be able to pick a seat i paid about for the flight and i am a platinum pro sapphire with american and one world partners alliance i was not very happy and on top of that i flew with jal in march on the same flights to bangkok and i did pick my seat out early jal said if i was an executive platinum that i could pick my seat outit worked out ok for me as they assigned me a seat the morning of my travel and gave me an aisle seat in the middle bulkhead the lady in the bulkhead on the right side of the plane wanted to stow her baggage under her seat so another guy with the seat behind the bulkhead myself and this nice lady from the philippines changed seats and i was given the seat i desired a long time ago no one is in front of me and i can stretch out easily now the attendants on this flight are super they are a great reason to fly jal they are super helpful and always have a smile and go out of their way to make you feel like you are the only person on the flight also the meal we were just given blows other airlines food out of the proverbial water i received a course meal and every course was great my initial headlines were going to be never fly jal but i am changing the crux of my article thanks to the great people i have mentioned above i will write later about this ongoing flight we are just leaving north america and still have quite a ways to go im back just had a snack these flight attendants are busy as bees in a hive and as nice as you could be im laughing now as im typing as i have done a on my original intent for this story these are the nicest and best flight attendants i have ever had the privilege of working with and i have flown an awful lot they also put out a piece of bamboo with a towel over it for people to stand on and relieve different stresses in their body they also posted a graphic on what part of the feet corresponds to different parts of your body this has been a great flight and im actually going to post some pictures of this flight and that is highly unusual for me they also have a cool wine label for their white and reds its using different vinifera from france its called double zero i also took a picture of a snack box they put out for all of us with the sign please help yourself we have been flying now about hours and its gone pretty quick great great flight,3
the crew were kind and friendly they provided good food and drinks the only disadvantage was it was too cold inside the plane i was glad to fly directly from narita to san diego,4
this review is for booking and preflight customer service with jal i regret not reading through more complaints about jal before booking on their website my issue has happened to others with shared code flights my husband and i booked our first leg with jal for our honeymoon we went onto their website for the booking at no point during the booking process are we informed about not being able select seats on the flight until checkin but that ended up being the case we called up jal and their response was that we probably missed the bit where we are informed about no seat selection possible we went back and went through the online booking process again and cannot find a statement that informs us about no seat selection until checkin for that flight we called back again the agent on the phone this time said that is the type of flight we booked and they cannot do anything except to add a note about that we wish to be seated together and informed us we can pick seats upon checkin time on the side all the calls have min wait time so far when it comes to harsh seat selection policy we feel that if this is a short flight fine if jal is a bare bones budget airline then fine if this is not our honeymoon then fine except this will be a long haul international flight with a supposed star service airline for our honeymoon jal is beyond disappointing for us in the booking process not only are we not informed about critical information that could help us decide we cannot seem to get any help in correcting a situation that we did not create so to sum up only fly jal if you are aware their online booking can miss critical pieces of information such as no seat selection available until flight checkin time when something goes wrong preflight you may likely be dealing with rigid non helpful customer service,2
we took the flight from sin to boston via narita both sectorcrew were very good and efficient they were attentive and also friendly aircraft were well cleaned and thru out the flight the flight stewardesses were coming out with drinks very pleasant flight even though the cabin were a bit warmth i do understand that the japanese like the cabin warmth but do spare a thought for the other passengers that are not japanese after all this is an international airlines,4
to start off jals business lounge at singapores changi airport is no better than the breakfast you get at a budget roadside motel in the united states very disappointing compared to the lounges we experienced on a four week asian trip the business class seat there was no first class on this flight was pretty tight service was efficient and impersonal not once did the flight attendant ask if we needed anything i was in the restroom when dessert was served and was never asked if i cared to have some when i returned to my seat this is not what i would expect from jal but maybe my expectations were too high,3
premium economy on jal was terrific the service is impeccable the extra leg room and seat size helped stay comfortable on the hour flight i wish the lower leg foot rest raised a bit higher but that would require a whole design change the food was quite tasty and the overall experience was amazing,5
the flight is good service is also good being a vegetarian the flight serves tasty hindu veg meal overall good experience,4
flying on a leisure trip from delhi to tokyo we were glad to choose jal as the in flight service experience was simply amazing best so far first of all economy seat comfort and leg room is way better than its any other competitor international airlines cleanliness on point as expected but what impressed us the most was the awesome customer experience by the cabin crew being a vegetarian and forgetting to prebook the meal had little issue with the available nonveg choices but the crew was so courteous that they went over the top and made us quick vegetarian snack with the things available with them sandwich sort of thing and feeling so sorry about us not able to have proper meal had it been some other airlines they would have hardly cared for that also dazed off during breakfast meal they put a hand written note to inform them once we awake to have meal as per need instead of just passing by or putting the food in the seat pocket simply amazing experience,4
due to the distance we decided to try premium econ i would never fly economy again the seats were roomy and very comfortable and as well as having headrests there was a personal led light for reading the windows had a colour change to block the sun if necessary the food was quite enjoyable for airlines and the wine list had very good wines and a champagne the staff were very polite and helpful as well we had access to the flight lounges i recommend jal premium to travellers if you want a comfortable tripand st class business are out of your price range,4
customer service to the core from supporting the customer right from check in counter till making feel like home till landing is the experience you will feel while you fly jal,4
right from check in counter to welcome aircraft seating comfort hospitality with overall options like entertainment dining makes a worth to travel,4
meals were average not much legroom the seat was uncomfortable the flight was on time flight attendants were very friendly,4
have travelled with jal many times and just love their skysuite in business class one feels cocooned from the rest of the passengers the service is excellent and the food is good can thoroughly recommend this airline,5
flown on jal from sydney to tokyo and return over times each experience has been faultless ive only realised how good they are until i flew on an airline inferior to japan airlinesjals service and comfort is always exceptional arigatogozaimasu,5
took japan airlines for our first ever trip to asia great service by grounds crew the flight crew were in a totally different league though excellent service they answered every customer call promptly and provided everybody whatever they asked for it was amazing to see these petite ladies put all size of luggage on the overhear bin the seats were a little cramp no legroom for the tall foreigners and not comfortable for the hour flight my butt hurt for a week after we landed the food was not very palatable though especially to an american palate cuisine is mostly geared towards asian travelers and no alternatives were provided even the chips were seafood flavored i used the bathrooms after we took off and i was surprised that it smelled like urine that was a turn off otherwise it looked clean and had enough supplies sanitary napkin toothbrush etc overall it was a pleasant ride,4
enjoyed an overnight direct flight from melbourne to japan not having a stopover and thus shorter travel time was great the airline serves alcohol free of charge and for airline food is better than the usual staff were welcoming and service was good,4
this was my first trip to japan and i chose jal as they are supposed to have a bit more leg room in economy the flight times also suited me as it is an overnight flight and as there is next to no time difference you do not lose a day traveling the first leg from adelaide is a qantas flight to melbourne then a bit of a wait until you board the jal flight around midnight it was quite comfortable in economy but i would probably opt for a cheaper flight as it was not that much better in leg room the overnight flight was great for me,3
the staff could not have done more to help out and make sure we were comfortable they even had cardigans for us they are to borrow not keep which helped when the temp fluctuates in the airplane nice and dark all passengers were considerate to keep shades down as long as possible food was fair but the service shined,4
i just return from sapporo japan flying with jal airlines this was my sixth trip to japan being twelve international flights plus twelve domistic flights to sapporo i all ways fly with jal my first flight to japan was with qantas six years ago which is a good airline but as i have a cultural interest in japan now i find jal provide the experience i like flying economy is not so bad price is right for a direct flight to tokyo only hrs i am not interested in cheap flights that take you about or more hrs with stop over in other counties eg hong kong jal provide a good service with good in flight service i all ways request an aisle seat leg room is ok better than being cramped in a middle seat food is mostly japanese style airline staff always friendly and help full all normal airline facilities jal also have a frequent flyer program to earn points for future flights i will continue to fly jal,5
excellent service and on time departure and arrival very scenic flight down to osaka staff are very friendly and courteous can thoroughly recommend flwith jal,5
all i could say is this is the most comfortable economy seat i have ever flown on a domestic flight despite there is no individual tv but they offer unlimited free wifi inflight i would love to take jal again,5
the plane is very comfortable smooth and feel safety while on board i was request for muslim meal and the crew very concerned about that they explained why i didnt get the ice cream or the same sandwiches which is for me that is sweet the same experienced when i flow back to the country thank you jal,5
this flight left tokyo haneda at in the morning for an eleven hour journey cabin crew helpful and polite plenty of leg room lights dimmed in cabin on completion of drinkssnacks easy for sleeping only one meal served which was prior to landing at heathrow once again i commend cabin crew for service thankyou,4
we flew home from japan on the japan airlines er business from tokyo to nyc the plane got great reviews onlinebut not from me there are business class seats and they are acrosswho would want to pay for business and sit in the middle unless youre a party of the window seat gives the most privacy but you and the flight attendant have to squeeze between the the seat next to you for access its a bit claustrophobic in there and the width of the seat is narrower than most it does provide a flat bed seat and the flight attendants are great but the plane seems old and worn out some of the compartments were kept closed with duct tapeno kidding probably the worst plane ive been on in business class,2
staff were very helpful and went out of their way even to the point of running after us after checkin and asking whether we would like to a free upgrade to premium economy my first international flight with jal but will definitely be back,4
they clearly put a lot of effort into service and i have to give it to their flight attendants they did a great job and were courteous and professional throughout our flights the plane going to tokyo had plenty of legroom for my husband who usually complains of cramped legs the food options can be found ahead of time on their website so you know what youre looking forward to overall would recommend,5
premium economy on jal is probably the same as business on ba the seats were very comfortable there was a lot of leg room the entertainment was great with touch screens that actually worked we got given noise cancelling headphones slippers eye mask ear plugs and toothbrushtoothpaste the service was very attentive and friendly as expected we also noticed that the air quality was much better in our area and much less noisy as compared with economy we had a stroll through to stretch our legs the windows had a special filter so you could still see the outside but were darkened so that we could sleep if we wanted to we flew with our year old son and though it was much easier in this area with lots of room the seat partitions and arm rests werent movable so we couldnt lie him flat across two seats for his nap this would have helped him sleep a bit more comfortably this problem will resolve itself though once hes grown up a bit it is definitely worth flying this class if you want a good journey and not to become too tired on reaching your destination everything was so efficient and neat even our buggy was put in a plastic carrier bag to protect it when loading on to the plane the seat arrangement was it wasnt busy at all and it was nice that they didnt fill the seats by giving upgrades to economy class selfish i know because you do have to pay quite a lot more for these seats we got given some nappies and snacks for our son and his first hot meal was great chicken and mash with broccoli very good for young child for some reason he didnt get a second hot meal when the adults got one which was a bit of a shame but we just shared ours with him it would have been great for him to have a meal with us as we used up all our spare snacks for this as well i would have given it an excellent rating if we were able to use seats to lie him down and for him to have had a meal with us if youre travelling as adults with older children then this would have definitely been excellent,4
this is very good airline great modern planes and great inflight entertainment and on board meals and beverages as well will be flying with jal airline again,4
experienced a lovely trip very courteous service nothing was too much trouble only negative is they need to update inflight entertainment to more contemporary and current,5
great flight service was excellent very attentive attendants food was good seat space was better than many other airlines,5
great airline the food was fantastic the service was really good i would certainly travel japan airlines again,5
cleared customs at narita then caught a bus across town to haneda seamless transition from international to domestic notwithstanding the requirement to change airports smooth flight to osaka picked up luggage and walked on to train,4
this was my first time on a jal flight and the experience was quite positive flight attendants were all smiles and friendly and not to mention finally some decent plane food and most importantly my flight was on time too,5
helpful checkin staff and very friendly cabin crew first time flying with this airline and if the opportunity arises will fly with them again,4
was able to choose seats at no extra cost nice clean modern cabin staff very professional and welcoming loads of films to watch onboard was easily able to book vegetarian meal in advance and noted different options for other dietary requirements veganglutenfree the food was the largest airplane meal ive ever had and tasted very acceptable also served with proper silver cutlery very comfortable for long haul flight would use again,5
nice food and amazing customer service legroom is better than other airlines they offer a variety of drinks including alcohol and food only bad thing about it their entertainment is not so up to date worth the money you pay,5
jal made my trip perfect the service is great the hostesses are so kind and the meal and wine menu are just amazing i couldnt have hoped for a better flight thank you so much to the company and the team this day,5
overall a good flight experience the service was very good the flight was on time and for a tall person cm i appreciated the adequate leg room in economy the only disappointment was that i checked in at osaka itamy on a domestic flight which was excellent but late and had a very tight connection in tokyo i arrived in melbourne on friday night but my luggage did not come until monday no one had contacted me and i tracked it down after making several phone calls as they could not guarantee delivery by monday evening i went to the airport to actually collect it myself it had been sitting in the luggage agents office for two days it was fully labbelled with name and phone number etc,4
very attentive crews but not enough english skills the dish and tea was amazingly good 영어 실력이 부족한 것만 빼면 굉장히 친절하고 부가적인 서비스도 휼륭했던 승무원들 덕분에 좋은 비행 경험이었습니다 기내식도 여타 다른 항공사들 보다 압도적으로 맛있어서 더 먹고 싶을 정도 였어요,4
this was the first time ive flown premium economy with any airline so i was interested to see what it was like departure was delayed as a result of electrical storms in the area unavoidable of course but the flight was about hours late in departing and for well over an hour we sat there without the offer of even a glass of water not impressed the range of movies on offer as ok if you dont normally see many food was patchy dinner was quite good breakfast was pretty ordinary the seat itself was quite comfortable and there was plenty of room more so because the seat next to me was empty the crew were friendly and efficient id like to travel premium economy with another airline in order to make a more valid comparison,4
i have flown several airlines in business class and jal rates at the top as far as im concerned most comfortable seats variety of food and drinks outstanding service,5
已經搭過十次以上日本航空每次都讚不絕口無論商務艙或經濟艙都一樣讓人驚艷在經濟艙上可以吃到牛肉丼飯商務艙就更不用說了清酒隨你喝 taking jal for over times every time is extraordinary,5
i took my granddaughter who dislikes flying to japan for graduation in june i splurged and got the premium economy seats we also took the nonstop flight it was an amazing experience the service was spectacular the entertainment system was supurb the food was excellent the long flight mostly comfortable and my granddaughter didnt have to use any of her motion sickness antidotes our tickets allowed us access to the first class lounge in boston and it was a superior place to wait for the flight unfortunately in japan there were no premium lounges but that was okay i will definitely make this trip again,5
our return flight to melbourne with jal was as good as expected from our previous outward leg flight with them quite efficient courteous staff make the journey effortless would fly with them again the only grumble is the fiddly in flight entertainment system control additionally more information on the available movies music would be good both minor issues really a more substantial pillow would also be good,5
i will highly recommend to fly jal to tokyo we flew fro sydney to tokyo in march and the flight was terrific the hostess were very polite helpful and well mannered the service and the food was very good in flight entertainment was of great quality and the seats were very comfortable with plenty of leg room i will fly again with themwell done,5
loved my flight on jal esp the layflat seats from tokyo to hanoi i wish they had those on the run from yvr the service was impeccable and a nice touch was when the cabin crew came around near the end of the flight and said something personal about each passenger the jal lounges were also comfortable and wellness stocked i had a whole day in natita coming back so not only got great info to go into town but was refreshed before getting on my next leg of my trip thank you japan airlines it was my first time with you but not my last,5
modern aircraft comfortable seats and great leg room for an economy class service is excellent bathroom kept very clean all though the flight the food was a bit disappointing but ok inflight entertainment not the best ive experienced but again ok overall a very pleasant experience and a big stepup from qantas at least on this route,5
jl return from melbourne with adl mel arranged by jal with qantas good flight good service and no problems even qantas were good this time for the first time in ages weve had problems with them in the past and their so called customer care has been more like do not care,5
much better value for money when compare to cathay pacific and the food and beverage is great just a pity that their in flight entertainment was a bit boring and the collection of movie is very limited,4
the service is excellent but they still have those terrible chairs in business class the chairs do not go horizontal completely and there are very uncomfortable i would understand if it is old equipment but the fly the new,3
this was a great airline to travel on premium economy was excellent with very comfy seat plenty of legroom and the food was pretty good the crew were super polite which you would expect of a japanese airline i discovered at checkin that if you book economy you can upgrade to pe at checkin for a very reasonable price if there are seats available,5
had a very smooth flight from manila to narita airport food was great presented by acclaimed chefs although there was a wait checking in it was a good flight all in all,5
jal is prompt efficient very neat and clean helpful and respectful this is total professionalism at its best as exhibited by the pilots flight attendants and ground staff they may not know english very well but will try their best to help you they will bring you to someone who speaks english and will also show you the way in contrast to some chinese airlines i have tried like china southern airlines or china eastern airlines you will get a feeling that they dont care about you at all i tried to ask help from some ground staff in shanghai but the lady seemed annoyed at me that i couldnt speak chinese i look very asian by the way not only that they do not speak english well but possibly due to a lack of training in people skills their attitude could get very rude so kudos to japan airlines keep doing what you do best being respectful to everyone i highly recommend jal,5
food collection is great service staff very friendly though compare to same route air ananda this plane model isnt as modern and seat isnt as comfortable id still choose jal for their staff friendliness and good quality food,5
very good flight experience i especially liked having seats only on the side for window and aisle no middle seat the flight departure and arrival times were good for each end of the trip the service very good too entertainment was varied and very good too overall it was a very good flight experience in economy class please note that i am short so the leg room was not a concern for me but tall people might be concerned the cabin ceiling height makes the plane feel spacious,4
had round trip flights on jal with three legs serviced by america airlines bought jal as it was the cheapest option offered via airtkt and the difference in service was could readily be seen between the american airlines legs and the jal legs the jal flight attendants were more attentive and kind jal also had a memory foam pad to use on one of the overnight legs and they made all the difference on ability to sleep comfortably when next head into asia will look to fly jal again,5
we actually flew with an award ticket business class to narita japan and coach back to dallas tx business class was wonderful the seats reclined completely and amenities service were a treat we werent lucky enough to snag business on the return but we had a two seat arrangement for our coach seats jal economy seats are wider and less pitched than many airlines notably one world partner aa it made the long flight home significantly more tolerable in economy food was interesting noodles for breakfast on the return but hey going all out for an authentic experience i definitely would fly jal again,5
i was terrified of flying for hours from boston to tokyo however after my flight with jal i am totally comfortable and doing it again in years they were on time the seats were comfortable they gave me a blanket pillow and headset the staff could not have been nicer and the food was delicious my favorite part was the entertainment they had so many movies shows and games i stayed entertained through the entire flight then i did it again to get home now i cant wait to go back,5
read that jal economy seat is the most spacious and won world no economy seat and since my favorite singapore air does not fly direct to hokkaido prefer direct flight for my trip thought i might as well take the chance to try out jal it was indeed spacious it was the most spacious economy i had ever tried but then again the comparison could be limited as i had flown on just sq thai cathay lufthansa ana eva china airline air nz silkair and the budget air scootjet starair asiaexscoot tiger it felt as spacious as scoots business class that i taken before perhaps is due to the very slim seat design which has well thoughtout features in line with what the japanese are famous for their thoughtfulness and consideration for others the meals served are on par with sq and the airhostess sevice are ever gracious and attentive i would definitely start flying to japan on jal please note when booking choose the flight that offers these jal sky wider economy seat not all flight will have these seat and i think most of the jal domestic flight in japan will not have these seats,5
exceeded our expectation in the quality of service provided staff were very helpful and obliging on the ground and in the air i would travel with this airline whenever it services the destination we are traveling too,5
attentive crew much more space could stretch out your legs didnt feel like the usual can of sardines,5
i would definitely recommend jal the flight crew members were amazing the bathrooms were kept very clean roomier leg space than some of the american airline i would choose this airline anytime without hesitation,5
having flown with jal before i rated this my best flight i didnt hesitate to fly with them again to japan i like the more legroom than an a qantas great service and food although the bread roll should be fresh looking forward to my return flight,5
the flight over was during the day which was great staff pleasant and seats we ok the tv has plenty of entertainment to keep you occupied the flight home was during the night for hours it would certainly be better if the foot rest on the premium economy seats would go level as trying to sleep you would slide down so made it very uncomfortable the seats reclined more than economy but still i feel they could improve when the seats go back they slide into themselves so dont encroach on the person behindthe food was quite ok and the toilets always clean would definitely fly again with them but pick a day time flight we were lucky enough to get into the business class lounges before boarding which was an added bonus we had two different planes,4
jal had a wonderfully caring crew on this flightthey really made my daughter feel welcome american airlines made zero effort our had good seats unlike the american airlines flight with horribly immobile seats good flight good service i would fly them again,4
the only downside of this trip was having to change airports in tokyo and collect luggage get a bus and then check in again i would have thought that premium economy passengers might have had their luggage taken for them however the lounges at haneda and narita were exceptionally clean and well stocked with food and drink the pe seats all the way to europe and back were very comfortable and in the dreamliner pe passengers had their own tollets,5
always a pleasure flying jal excellent service friendly crew food was okay but better than other airlines free alcohol always a plus love the small touches like disposable slippers and toothbrushes they include,5
the cabin service and food offerings are absolutely top notch the cabin staff really go out of their way to make the trip as comfortable as possible while the entertainment options maybe fall a little short of some rival airlines and are more geared towards the japaneselanguage market their core customer there is still plenty of choice the jal sky suite is an excellent businessclass product but try to avoid the middle seat in center of the aircraft because it loses out on storage cubbies compared to the other seats its a little annoying they turn all the cabin lights on again two hours before landing in order to offer passengers a last meal before arrival it means the sleep time on a flight of this duration hours isnt great,5
we were on our way from rochester ny to beijing china the longest part of the trip was chicago to tokyo i was told by an asian friend that asian airlines had bigger seats that is true we were in premium economy even though on the trip to tokyo we wwere in the middle seats there was ample room i am and i would stretch my legs to my hearts content the amenities were great there was plenty of food and drink the food was very good quality the choices for movies and tv was impressive i will fly them again and have recommended to friends,5
this was my first time flying jal i will use them again friendly service crew acceptable food compared to the quality of the other carriers take off and landing on time,5
i was on vacation in the us when i was diagnosed with the flu days prior to my return trip to bangkok my doctor told me to delay my flight for my own health and that of the other passengers but i had booked a nonrefundable ticket with no travel insurance and had to just throw myself on the airlines mercy thankfully they were very gracious to me and rebooked me on the same flight a week later without even charging me the normal change fee thank you jal i highly recommend this airline for their excellent customer service,5
the flight was perfect on time the food was good the crew was very friendly for a five star rating the landing should have been better,4
i have flown jal many times and its always a good service domestically seats are comfortable staff are courteous and everything is always clean,4
was my st time fly with jal to haneda airport the flight lavatory was super stinky once onboard ride was bumpy and the worst was landing the pilot shocked me twice during landingflight to tokyo and back to singapore i can only say no no to jal if i need to fly to japan the next time,1
beautifully maintained dreamliner with spotless cleanliness in the cabin the crew were extremely efficient as well as attentive comfortable seats and reasonable choice of meals,4
our first time flying on japan airlines and my wife and i were impressed by their service boston to narita route is served by their dreamliner which offers confortable lay flat seats on business class entertainment onboard was not as good as emirates but service was excellent making this a very enjoyable flight,5
boeing premium economy is excellent with seat pitch of excellent seat comfort and legroom with good food and decent service from crew excellent inflight entertainment lounge access was also a plus,4
such a friendly and comfortable experience would definitely travel with this airline again great aircraft service meals,5
only took this flight because ba cancelled a direct uk flight with hindsight we got the better deal the cabin crew were the most polite ive ever seen and the standard of the cabin was superb food definitely to my liking and the cleanest toilets in the air,5
whilst it was mine and my wifes first time in business class it was a bit of a let down with q to say the least the jal business class was simply amazing the crew were super attentive and made us feel at home the food was restaurant quality the ife system monitor was huge if i had to pick a downside the seats might feel a little narrow for some but in no way uncomfortable simply put if flying from aus to jap there is no question who id choose,5
we travelled to tokyo narita from sydney this year in april flying jal premium economy class service and staff were helpful friendly and prompt the space in the seat area was fine however the footrest which extends at the front of the seat to allow you to stretch out in comfort was of poor design the footrest would not hold position when the height was adjusted and once the weight of feet were added it caused the footrest to sag resulting in sliding down from your sitting position and this impacted on my bad back initially we thought it may just be an issue with the seats on that plane however on the return flight to sydney we had the same experience as a result it was difficult to get into a fully comfortable position to rest,4
i chose to spend more to experience the premium economy i dont know that i would spend that money again the seats and extra leg room were nice but given that the economy seats have decent leg room i am not sure there was enough added value the food was average the entertainment selection was probably below average the staff were all very friendly i would say the biggest advantage of the premium seat was having no trouble with finding luggage space in the bin above the benefit of the lounge access was nice the sfo lounge is very underwhelming though i think i would probably just buy the lounge access in the future i am curious as to the experience on the other airlines jal was a fine flight but nothing to brag about,4
so my family and i were on a ama flight lax to osaka which was flown on a jal plane about minutes into the flight when the attendants were passing out beverages i ordered my kid a soda it was noisy i was distracted by kid who as a year old was excited to be on a plane and i did not realize he had given my kid a soda water until a few minutes later after he passed i chuckled thought it was no big deal and passed it to my wife who asked another stewardess to exchange it for a soda the flight attendant actually made my wife apologize for the mistake and then ignored us for the rest of the flight i mean literally the attendant gave the guy next to me a drink and then walked away from my frantic requests and hand signals it was unreal i am guessing it was racism as in the initial confrontation the attendant kept on using english with my wife who is japanese and of course spoke to her in japanese between the grudge keeping flight attendants and the s uncomfortable seats it was a rough hours after the flight we contacted jal to complain they contacted the flight attendants who said they had given us special service because of their mistake believe me you do not want the special service,1
checkin staff at jfk could be a bit more consistent utilise their discretion and be a bit hospitable the flight from jfk was uneventful thank god and the service was generally attentive although some passengers got a little loud at some points during the flight which was understandable to a certain extent due to the length of the flight the meals were tasty and the bathrooms were always clean i am not a tall person and had adequate leg room but the seats were super hard and initially i found it very difficult to find a spot to fall asleep in but managed to at some point during the flight on arrival at haneda i noticed that my suitcase handle was broken and went to the relative parties to report it the lady spoke english and was very thorough completed all the paperwork and i was on my way the hard seats alone are enough for me to fly business on my next long haul if i fly with jal again,4
it was good there was a checkin counters and security check of first class only but it was not good there was no emigration of first class onlyfirst class lounge was comfortable cabin attendant welcomed with smile it was the seat surrounded by a pattition such as modern living room with decoration of wood the combination of the french courses and extensive wine selection ot top chef supervision were like a flying restaurant after the turndown service i was able to sleep soundly dressed to the prepared pajamas cabin attendant gave me service in advance understand my needs my heart was filled with the flight such as i stayed in augerge i was not tired at all in spite of the hours of flight british immigration was smooth in the use of fast tracki was able to spend without stress from the biginning to the end of the flight i want to use jal first class again,5
best first class experience from start to finish jal first class passengers also get access to sakura lounge at haneda airport shower room is available although a bit on the small side staff is very friendly and lounge is really spacious made to order food hamburg steak w madeira truffle was available during other services such as massage chair and shoe shine service available once on board the flight attendant introduce themselves service is top notch and attendants very genuine unlike the other airline cough cough but it could be because this is first class and this was also my flight attendants first time in this cabin needless to say every is great in terms of food and service wagyu beef caviar champagne and bed was made when ready to sleep imo jal provides the best service in the sky and staff seem very genuine in making sure you are taken good care of,5
on the august my wife and i were travelling business class with jal to prague jl from sydney with an overnight stay paid by jal at the marroad hotel i would like to report back on our experiences the food in the restaurant was of poor quality and lacked the flair and skill japanese food is known for the room had a dirty towel on the sideboard i use a cpap machine this needs to be plug into next to the bed the only way to have the bedside power point work was to have the hallway light on i called reception who came to the room who confirmed this was correct the required us to sleep all night with the light on in the room the internet was unusable the router was outside if our room door and we still had virtually no connection we had reception come and assist but could not fix the issue overall in my view the hotel was at best stars i am confused and disappointed as to how the sits along side jal business class airport and inflight product i understand the airline prides itself on the quality of the product and rightly so,3
my family took the flight to narita for hours eventhough we were in economy the leg room was spacious and did not feel cramped the toilet was very clean and with the electronic buttons for bidet and all other functions crew were attentive and very polite overall a good experience,4
our flight to kuala lumpur from narita was very comfortable with jal nice and friendly staff i had the japanese lunch which was good i ordered an earl grey tea but was not available only had english beakfast tea inflight movie entertainment selection was average vanity kit was not given therefore cannot comment on that overall not a bad flight,5
if you wonder why such a disparity between reviews between starterrible and starsbest its because of cultural insensitivity simply put to understand it one needs to realize that as a rule japanese are highly cultivated people who are generally very polite and warmhearted and would like to go out of the way to help you thats how japanese are brought up but on the other hand they are also brought up to be ultimately loyal like to the company they are working for and that means the company rules book goes before the bible between these two polar opposites they have to live so here we are if things are simple straightforward and along the book all is perfect youll get wonderful service and experience however if anything anything at all is slightly off all is crashed nothing is going to work anymore dont expect any problem solving my personal experience started with ordering tickets on line sure enough no problem getting ticket laxtokyo nice options all crystal clear but alas i need to fly to okinawa with at least one stopover in naha thats not a straight line and here it just refuses to work properly time i spent trying to make things work any way imaginary would be enough to walk to okinawa and back calling customer service and asking for help to handle their web site predictably ended up with statement they dont know what is the problem with web site and offering me to pay fee for the privilege to buy tickets over the phone even that though did not work as by the time i convinced the agent that stopover means im stopping for several days in naha before proceeding to ishigaki which is also okinawa as island in okinawa archipelago which took significant efforts btw it hit pm and line just went dead seems they automatically cut it at pm maybe as well too as i already started to have images of hawaii in my head vs dreadful images of having a day of bad weather in okinawa and get stranded there by jal as that would be a problem they could not solve bottom line three stars arithmetic average of great service and absence of any problem solving,3
flew short haul flight with japan airlines from seoul to fukuoka cabin was clean and fresh seat pitch had enough room small snackmeal was served even for this short flight and i was pleasantly surprised had very enjoyable flight,5
i flew from jakarta to tokyo when departing at morning their checkin is quite fast including their maximum baggage allowance allow me to bring pieces of luggage thanks to extra space for usb port and charging socket i could work and entertain conveniently the breakfast was good also the drinks where you can request anything you want extremely polite and nice flight attendants great inflight entertainment where you could watch japanese shows or movies music and some mangas you could read the lavatory is frequently cleaned for a few hours so it gave a fresh scent for passengers who need to go there,5
this our second trip with jal and it is always a pleasure flying with this airline staffs are nice food are great seats are good and plane is very clean always on time and always nice to have a layover in japan my second choice airline for my number will be ana airlines but pretty much the same as both are from japan,5
flew melbourne to tokyo departing at midnight arriving around am intended to sleep all night or at least until they served breakfast idea worked but poor pillow made sleeping less comfortable the thin biscuit wafer type pillows dont work for this westener staff excellent food good had seats a c good location only issue is its a bit squeeze getting past aisle seat to window seat but hey were in bc not cc cattle class so shouldnt complain right as expected of jal flight departed and arrived on time would fly with them again,4
my daughter and i were excited to fly on jal and we were not disappointed the configuration of their seats allow everyone to have their own private compartment i liked the window dimming system which allows the windows to gradually get darker or lighter the tvs are inches super huge there is a good variety of entertainment to choose from the flight attendants are so polite and helpful they volunteered to take a photo of my daughter and i there is so much food available outside from your regular meals the seat becomes a lie flat seat which is excellent the only downside is that the seat cushion was hard even with the mattress pad that i was given the seat was uncomfortable i found it difficult to get comfortable i look forward to flying on jal again,4
have flown on jal economy two times on the er and both have been wonderful for a hour flight the seats are far superior to any us airline and of course the service you receive is great the attendants are gracious as expected from a japanese company and the food was delicious with japanese flair but could be eaten by someone whos not too keen on trying different foods good size tv screen with lots of movie options to make the flight go by quickly,5
our flight was delayed about minutes due to weather and i was amazed at how apologetic the crew was for the delay it is highly unusual back in the states to know any reason a flight is delayed or receive a heart felt apology from he ground crew to the pilots to the flight attendants the service was excellent flying business class though i wish the seats would have been better cleaned between flights,4
the return flight was good the flight to vietnam was cramped an hot because i booked my flight through united airlines i couldnt pick my seats on jal they put us in the back rows in the middle i tried to pay to upgrade our seats and they wouldnt even let me do that the food was really good and the service was great just wish i could get better seats,3
seems like most people had woes with their preflight processes i dont remember much about that though one thing that stuck with me was i couldnt resist having an ice cream prior to the flight and was fighting hard to finish it as the gate was closing didnt want to waste the ice cream and we then tried to board the plane with the half eaten ice cream without being stopped yay on a different leg we were also given the privilege of priority boarding as we picked the seats next to the emergency exit thats where i want to be waiting when i do not have an ice cream in hand flight crew were also friendly and attentive throughout the flight seats were also comfortable for a domestic flight the journey was much more comfortable than the international flight we arrived in just wished it could just bring us home,4
booked a flight for domestic japan airlines and apparently it never went through i received the email providing me with the confirmation number and fare cost after one month i decided to check up and found the flight hasnt even been booked i called and they said they have no credit card record and the flight was canceled i flipped and said how can that be i added in my credit card and everything so i decided to do it again went through and filled out everything online and added all my payment info i get a similar type of email stating the ticket purchase deadline of this reservation is august please purchase your ticket by the deadline above otherwise the reservation will be canceled automatically after the deadline so i told customer service and she said it went through you dont have to do anything anymore then i argued what about the first time i went through it i wanted the fare of my original booking so i next decided to cancel the flight i jut booked because i was only trying to prove a point of what i did and what email i got then next i cancelled the flight i just put in so happens i only get of my refund back so i lost another bucks the stupid site said i would get all my refund back but if you dig down certain flights will have a penalty so they said i would have to call domestic japan airline i tried calling and waited over minutes on the line just gave up what the f man,1
jal had the best schedule to reach my destination from my home i went to their website and compared their classes of service the website showed that premium economy had minor differences from economy at times the price so i chose economy booking on jals site proved impossible because it refused to accept numerous entries including my name address frequent flier number etc all in wrong format so i booked the same flights with travelocity super easy but travelocity didnt give me a chance to select my seats so i called jal to get my seats reserved this is months ahead so should be a good choice of seats after hours yes two hours on hold i got a jal agent who informed me that my class of travel does not allow seat selection until check in the agent would not even allow me to request an aisle seat which is essential to me for health reasons i doublechecked their web pages describing the different classes of service and there was no mention of this difference between the two classes there is even a section on seats which shows pictures of the seats for the two classes but never mentions that they will not allow advance seat selection in economy unlike all other airlines i have flown some airlines charge a small fee such as for advance seat selection in the case of jal it would cost me over to upgrade service for these flights to get my aisle seat to me this is inexcusable i will not fly with jal again,1
having booked my window seat a many weeks before i find on boarding i have a middle seat f two things here whats is the point of having advance seat booking and always check what seat they have given you at check in premium economy is very good but disappointed with this flight seat reallocation without notification at check in,2
my year old just flew this airline to and from asia he had very positive things to say very attentive crew great food clean would definitely fly jal on our next trip,5
japan airlines is fantastic to travel with their service is awesome the cabin crew are very helpful and the ground service camparable the premium economy seating does not recline as much as other airlines and the food is not up to scratch however as a seasoned traveller i eat before i get on a plane and i dont sleep your really paying for wider seats and less people in your space sleep quality is non existant to upgrade to business would have been good but not at the cost they were asking,4
although the service was nothing short of spectacular on par with all of the other airlines known for superb service i have to knock japan airlines for two things first the business class seats in the are nowhere near as comfortable as the ones i have experienced on many other business class flights with other airlines and second it is amazingly hard to sleep with a toddler screaming and yelling for of the flight beyond that my daughter was asked if she would be willing to move because the couple wanted to give the toddler his own seat even though only the two adults had paid seats this was easily one of the worst bc flights i have ever been on due to these reasons even the earplugs provided could not drown out the yelling and screaming i definitely recommend jal for its service but not for the other reasons listed my hope is that some day an airline will set age restrictions for businessfirst class and that airline will likely win me as a customer for life,3
the flight was so relaxing and in no time we arrived in japanin business class we experienced beautiful japanese cuisine we also have got a cardigan,5
flight was part of homeward journey to new zealand we had been away months and during that time had flown on many different airlines and this was the best after air nz of course staff were friendly and polite the food was a choice between international and japanese food flight was hours long new release movie choices to watch leg room seemed more than other airlines and seats had an optional foot rest a good head rest adjustment and were comfortable,5
after so many years of flying between usa and japan now i only fly with japan airlines even in economy class they treat you like a human not cargo they place snack stations at the back of the aircraft where you can help yourself with water juice and snacks during the flight it is hours flight and you want to be as comfortable as possible i tried to save few dollars and flew other airlines but i always come back to jal,5
my first time with jal every single detail is ok staffs are all nice both ground and air services,5
one of my favorite airlines for flights to asia the other are asiana and cathay pacific its dreamliner service on both legs san to nrt and then nrt to mnl the on the manila leg was a bit newer and slightly larger than the one on the san to nrt flight seats are comfortable with decent cushioning and leg room theyre abreast on the outboard rows and are wider than most the dreamliners are comfortable to ride quiet and with a foot pressured altitude i dont care for the lcddimming windows while its nice to be able to dim the shade and still see through the window its slow to react to the control and keeps changing even after you release the button an indicator for the setting would be nice the aisle seats on the outboard rows have a vertical metal case that takes up about of the sidetoside leg room on the sannrt flights the dreamliner between nrt and mnl doesnt have it one thing i didnt expect when i booked this particular itinerary i booked it through american airlines because the trip was marginally less expensive than booking through jal what they dont tell you is that you cant get a seat selection until you check in thats a bit rough when you consider the possibility of seating somewhere uncomfortable for hours,4
i didnt expect to be packed inside the airplane for seven hours i didnt pick this airline it was chosen for me what a nightmare run by young kids less than yo with no sense of customer service,1
somehow i expected more for our flight from osaka to tokyo boarding was slow service was okay but only average but regardless its a good option and priced about the same as the bullet train with less hassle to get to the airport train station,3
polite staff i was sleeping on take off and when i woke later found a sticker on the back of the seat in front of me telling me to contact them if i needed anything later when they served breakfast they gave me extra food,4
what a world of difference after several times flying to japan on american airlines we decided to choose the one nonstop flight operated as a codeshare by japan airlines and considering the hours we had spent previously packed into an undersaized aa seat we decided to opt for the premium economy it included access to an airport lounge at dfw with free snacks and beverages instead of across in a jal has across in a and the premium economy has across extra legroom in front of us leg rest and foot rest and the seat reclines in a shell where it doesnt lean back into the person behind you the food and service were also superior the only minor hiccup is that jal doesnt participate in tsa precheck in the future american airlines should issue a boarding pass in their app or print one at the counter with our tsa precheck status and then use the jal boarding pass to get on the plane,5
almost everything about this flight is as good as you can expect it to be configuration on a b gave plenty of seat width leg room was even more impressive the seat was very comfortable even without declining arrival card in every seat pocket our flight was delayed an hour and we received updates from the cockpit every fifteen minutes or so they informed us the exact time expectancy they received from atc and it turned out to be pretty accurate food was absolutely delicious and presented nicely my favorite has to be the limited custard pudding ice cream from haagen dazs which to my understanding is served on all outbound international flights the cabin crew was as you would expect amazingly nice and polite if there is any complaint at all it would be the entertainment system which was a bit limited compared to the average airline i could not turn off subtitles which bothered me a little the provided headphones produced good sound quality but were not the most comfortable overall it was a great experience flying jal i am looking forward to more custard pudding ice cream in the future,5
great servuce with jal comfortable and reasonable fare ticket will ride again for my next travels really recommend it the attendants are kund and friendly and attended our needs same as with other customers needs,5
following a thoroughly enjoyable visit to fukuoka i had to get to tokyo i contemplated the shinkansen but opted instead for a ride on a japan airlines boeing from fukuoka to tokyo haneda for the flight i opted jl they were operating a triclass configured aircraft with economy j seat and first products on board first class checkin at fukuoka is a dream located upstairs the wood panelled checkin lounge resembles a fivestar hotel after an efficient checkin followed by a luxe private security zone directed me instantly into the sakura lounge with terrific views across the tarmac after enjoying light refreshments in the lounge i made my way to boarding where first class was boarded as priority through a dedicated jetway the dedicated f cabin is nicely configured in a xx staggered arrangement of fourteen recliner seats in soft cream leather with a seat pitch of inches cabin crew swiftly pointed out the features of the seat including charging points for electronic devices and offered slippers and shoe horns lunch was served on this short minute flight a single tray was offered with multiple dishes beautifully presented including rice crackers to go with a drink a steamed salmon appetizer a sesame tofu and crabmeat dish and a main dish of braised chicken in a japanese pepper soy sauce niigata premium steamed rice some miso soup and japanese sweet all was absolutely delicious light yet filling flavoursome and rich for those keen on lighter options udon de sky was available as was consomme drinks included apple orange or sunshine juice liquid salad a cold pressed smoothie of sorts unique to jal colas teas water iced coffee and a nonalcoholic suntory beer in addition to two sakes on offer nicolas feuillatte brut champagne was available along with a ferrari sparkling brut wine from italy two white wines chenin blanc or a white bordeaux and two reds a temperanillo and cote du rhone quite a nice selection covering most palates i thought a premium shochu was also available in addition to four beers and suntory whiskey crew were extremely polite attentive and engaging the aircraft was immaculate and remained so throughout the flight the chief purser who had personally greeted each f customer returned as we were on stand to thank us for flying japan airlines the crew gave me a small bag containing rice crackers as i had commented how particularly delicious their rice cracker mix wasa delightful touch the view of japan from my window seat was wonderful for the duration of the flight it put a different perspective on compared with the train journey i was in a taxi at hnd within minutes of landing overall a thoroughly enjoyable travel experience,4
very accommodating with seat selection no extra charges started from kona hawaii requested exit row seating they told me i needed to talk to someone at jal in honolulu international airport when i got there they expected me and provided me exit row seat with no charge jal staff was really hospitable and friendly food was good seat was comfortable for that long flight to narita then to manila i would flying this airline again,5
jal used to have the best premium economy when flying to tokyo compared to air france alitalia and ba all tried out considering seats service and pricing in that regard this flight return has been clearly disappointing in particular considering that the price for one of us was which is clearly not a bargain for a premium economy seat there was business on korean air at that price but we could not have travelled together speaking of travelling together this has been one of the main issue when using separate bookings in all fairness bookings were taken via ba but what is the point of registering a named travel companion if this is simply ignored we were separated both on the outbound and the return flight with in both cases ground staff unable to come up with a helpful solution it is only once on board and largely due to the proverbial courtesy of fellow japanse travellers that we could travel together during these permutations it was hilarious to discover that we had not been the only coupled separated despite the moderate size of the premium economy cabin as for the service it is still competitive compared with other airlines but not as good in my view as in previous years on jal for instance on the return night flight there were unusually few rounds of water and beverages for a similar price i dont think i would fly jal pe again,3
i used to fly domestic in the philppines with our local airlines and since i had a chance to go japan i like to try different airlines and not to book with local airlines in ph but japan airline instead the price is reasonable from the airport the staff are kind i requested them to give me a window seat the flight used boeing and it was also my first time to ride on that wide aircraft i was so amazed the seats are wide enough and theres also an entertainment were you can watch and listen to the movies and various music they served delicious foods of course japanese food and i enjoyed it so much i had experience japan automatically even im still on the plane this december i will be flying to japan airlines again and that was manila narita layover hanedaitami and kixhanedalayovernaritamanila,5
flew both to and from laxnarita on jal paid for premium economy since it is such a long flight even though we were a family of so it was pricey to upgrade i also booked through american airlines so i could earn mileage aa and jal have a partnership arrangement premium economy is a very small section of the plane between business and economy seats give you extra legroom lots of little freebie extras love the slippers and free alcohol and a pretty good recline of course not as good as first class or business where you get your own pods but still appreciated couldnt swing first class or business costs when dealing with tickets seats themselves werent very comfortable but not worse than regular airlines would have been nice if they had a little more padding though also a nice extra with premium economy is that we were able to wait for our plane in the jal lounge and that had drinks and snacks and comfortable seating which managed to pass the time nicely overall a very comfortable flight,5
great flight service was as usual excellent the staff were attentive but not intrusive as is sometimes the case with other airlines i chose the japanese meal im western but love the food and have always believed the best japanese meals are served when leaving japan but on this flight from lhr the food was excellent and easily as good as the return flight a great selection of wine and a nice surprise a couple of japanes options on the menu as well overall a great experience,5
this was my first time using japan airlines am a frequent traveler and have used singapore air cathay pacific emirates qatar etc jal was a very pleasant experience for me and family leg room is much better than airlines mentioned above inflight service is par if not better all flights were on time plane for jakarta to tokyo b better than tokyo usa b meal quality good though choices of movies limited,5
a typhoon was nearby which effected the scheduling of the flight out of narita checkin was initially effected but once a plane was ready it was all efficient service with respect and a smile checkin was excellent with a premium economy ticket access to the business lounge is included which is a definite plus when considering flying with jal also offered when flying sydney to narita the lounge is a little retro these days and the offerings are rather basic but it is a very nice place to spend an hour before the flight particularly as shopping options in the crowded international departure area of narita are rather limited the plane was very new and comfortable and overall the flight experience was very good seat is excellent entertainment screen is great i watched two movies food is good service is great the premium economy experience is lessened compared to other airlines as there is no dedicated toilet the range of snacks offered is very small with nothing exciting to nibble and no pretakeoff drink bubbly juice or water as provided by some other carriers the missing little premium economy perks which reduce an excellent rating to a very very good i will definitely fly jal again,4
return flight to hong kong again nothing to complain about great aircraft and superb service my only gripe was my childs meal was great and had lots of child friendly things the carrot was in a shape of an airplane for example and they had a very small hellokitty type fork and the dessert had a teddybear shaped chocolate my expectations for my meal were increased as i thought the japan catering would be better on this leg than the outward bound unfortunately this turned out not to be the case and i would describe the food as edible perhaps next time i will order the kids meal for myself other than that the flight was delayed due to strong winds in hk nothing to do with the airline and i couldnt really fault the overall experience,5
we sat near the front of economy from hong kong to narita not a long flight but we really couldnt find anything to complain about the service was excellent the plane was clean and the food was good for an economy class flight we ordered a kids meal which came very quickly following take off and the lunch service was also served quickly with a good range of drinks not the most spacious of cabins and leg room but it was only a four hour flight would definitely travel with them again,5
good things had free wifi during flight time on my way to tokyo had early checkin and baggage release facility bad thing had a poor communication at naha airport we were almost missing the flight due to lack of information had no wifi on our way to okinawathats not a big problem as its a free service,3
you cant go wrong on jal and with business class its a comfortable relaxing experience the food and service was great the only complaint is the lay flat seats are a little short for anyone six foot or taller,4
when i boarded the aircraft and saw that the seating arrangement in business class was similar to american airlines i took heart but it was short lived the seats on japan air in biz class are very uncomfortable they are narrow and hard and have few ergonomic adjustments the area around the seat is not well utilized with no place to storehold items during a long flight considering the high price of these seats think twice before spending the money on this class of service for long flights on japan air made me really appreciate american airlines setup,3
never had that much space in economy classcrew was very friendly service was great everything was finetotally recommend that airline,5
we arrived at narita airport looking forward to our premium economy flight to melbourne it was a very pleasant surprise to be told we had been ungraded to business class for the trip i can say without question the service and food served on this flight was outstanding the staff were attentive and the western main course meal in particular the beef was in a class of its own a very enjoyable flight made more enjoyable by the staff and the food,5
the crew are nice although cant converse well in english the seat is comfortable and interior of the cabin is nice there are good selection of english movies but not so for other asian movies they are mainly japanese asian movies and musics the food however was horrible not very appetitisingnone the less the price tag is the most attractive part of the flight,4
japan airlines premium economy is the best ive flown and i wont hesitate to fly again the pod like seats mean that you can recline within the space of your own pod not disturbing anyone behind you and not being disturbed the service is typically japanese polite courteous and nothing is too much trouble the food is fine it is plane food after all and the amenities are comfortable,5
check in was easy staff members excellent flight crew were also exceptional the trip was an easy run made easier with the assistance of crew would not hesitate to recommend this airline the only downside was the entertainment lacks new movies,5
flying japan airlines was one of the best decision that we took the flight attendants were warm and hospitile the food was gourmet quality the seats even though in economy class were clean and comfortable even after getting down the flight the flight attendants helped us with some key information on the airport and the city looking forward to travel again with the same airlines,5
the seat was comfortable helping me to sleep well the airline provides privilege tag to checked language but long immigration queue made meaningless the portion of food was a bit small for me and economy class food was provided advance seat reservation really helps for me to book my favourite place,5
great airline always super efficient friendly helpful staff seamless connection in tokyo onboard wifi really works well food is well presented drinks well selected,5
i flew from melboune to tokyo to moscow flights and seats were ok i have flown in more comfortable and modern seat compartments it was ok it not fantastic the problem was food unless you liked or ate japanese menu my wife fell asleep on take off and was then told sorry all western food is gone japanese or starve not even sushi was on offer the tickets were ok but we will never fly with them again and i travel constantly,2
i went okinawa japan in march i flew from london to tokyo by british airways bs which was not as good as i expected while i returned to london by japanese airlines jal which added to my disappointment with ba anyway jal was the best airline i travelled with the flights were amazing the food on flight was amazingjust like had in okinawa i was surprised with the free wifi service they had on the flight although i was a bit uncomfortable with legroom i expected a bit of wide space for such a long flightthe flight attendants were excellent helpful they had provided a huge entertainment options on board headphones and shawl for coldamazing overall my experience with the jal was amazing despite the legroom thingy,4
legroom was very limited food was average flight attendants were attentive and helpful entertainment choices were ok but not fantastic,4
both jal and ana are the representation of the japanese service dedicated staff thinking in passenger service giving you a fantastic experience when traveling everytime i can choose jal i go with them,5
have flown most asian airlines out of san diego and los angeles for me and my wife jal is hands down best stewards are super nice polite professional floors bathrooms kitchen are are immaculate that said their pe class is not worth it given huge price difference from china airlines eva cathay k difference is typical but jal is so clean and spacious in economy that i often fly it due to cleanliness and great flight crew their service and cleanliness is direct reflection of values japanese culture philippine airlines is the worst dirty bathrooms snooty flight staff slow cleanup after meals like minutes last time we flew after an almost year gap we decided to try them in feb lax mnl since it was a quick get in and get back to san diego in days and direct connection to other parts of pi saves few hours a hour flight and two of bathrooms in economy were unusable for half the flight no toilet paper dirty disgusting so big lineup in business class flight attendants didnt care my wife is filipina and its embarrassing to her as it reflects badly on culture and mentality of her native land weve sworn off pal for internal flights their domestic flights are better but always late plane always late pal is well known in pi,5
i was not impressed of the service and the whole experience the seats are very small compare to other international airlines i thought that it is clean as japan is very clean but i was disappointed i would try other airlines before jal again,3
i was supposed to fly on air india on that day however the flight was delayed by hrs due to some technical problem i was informed by air india in tokyo that i could take japan airlines flight problem was that my fare was calculated roundthe world c class basis and on star alliance member airline only however japan airlines accepted me to fly with them even though it is not a star alliance member this saved me hr waiting time at tokyo airportflight experience on japan airlines was excellent,4
when i go to japan i always take jal its only one direct flight from boston i believe besides great flight attendants every single time and good satisfying meals as airplane food they serve a cup of ice cream as a dessert after dinner often jals original fravor with ice cream makers those ice creams are truly frozen solid every time it makes me wonder how they can keep them such good shape they serve sliverware not plastics plastics will snap in half because of the solid frozen ice cream lol their sheets are quite comfortable even for economy class you dont feel so clogged up their economy class sheets received some kind of world prize please refer to jals website for the details they hardly ever delay their flights can be arriving a bit earlier due to the weather conditions but never been late even once when i experienced over all they are quite established steady company in my opinion and the best part is they must keep trying daily bases to hold their quality up there may be better than yesterday but never less i highly recommend jal for the long flight you can count on my words above,5
we recently flew jal to tokyo and return for a holiday this was our first time with this airline it proved to be one of our best flight experiences the inflight staff excelled with continued unobtrusive service from food to drinks and any other needs so different to others where when the lights went out everyone disappearedthe food was also good and the flights were on time,5
it was my nd time using jal and i still remain very happy with this airline stewardess were genuinely warm flight was smooth landing was calm and meals were greater than my countrys airlines,5
i cant help but think of the financial difficulties the airline has faced in the past ten years and reflect on my recent flight with jal the service was impeccablewarm friendly attentivereflective of the japanese spirit of hospitality however flying in premium economy you see that while you have some choice in your meals jal is looking to keep their costs low the quality is quite good arguably excellent and worth of mention but you will not get much of a choice or a spread even in premium economy in some ways the premium economy product was no different than some of the business products ive experienced on us carriers except that you had excellent service from the start at haneda at the ticket counter to deplaning in san francisco,4
flying to jakarta indonesia jal flight number was the first leg of a two flight sequence jal once again lived up to expectations in service food and the flight itself the flight is about hours the cost is just under cathaypacific and singapore all three are great however japan goes the proverbial extra mile a big plus is they operate with boeing s with that planes configuration there is plenty of room even in economy which i flew the first time a while ago jal is a great choice,5
the airplane is amazingthe technology food and service are the best the flight attendant are all beautiful and also dress very nice and presentable they really work very hard to provide the best service possible i highly recommend this airlines to everyone its the best,5
we havent flown on jal for some twenty plus years as they were always more expensive however this particular time they were less expensive than ana so we booked the onboard service both ways were mediocre at best which is like cathay pacific nothing special just routine work food was borderline ok and did not serve any real snacks or light food the entertainment movie list was also lacking in selection luckily we downloaded movies from netflix into our devices will probably not fly on this airline again,3
jal needs to work on their online reservations systems so that international reservation changes can be made online whilst in japan currently you cannot make international reservations changesmanage bookings in japan online you must use the call centre which charges y usd for every seconds with a wait time on average of minutesthats before you have even spoken to an agent to enquire about changing a fare date when you get through to the call centre often the agents understanding of english is poor and you will be shuffled around until the call centre staff find a member who can understand exactly what you want to do with your booking my advice onboard jal is a superb airline but their system for handling booking changes is frustratingexpensive and time consuming when booking with jal check wether your fare is changeable online particularly if travelling on business or working on projects that may require a flexible departure date,3
i flew with japan airlines because finnair cancelled our flight boarding was very good and seats was very comfortable staff was very good too inflight entertainment was very varied take off and landing was very smooth food was ok i can recommend this airline,4
took this flight from los angeles to tokyo departure was delayed due to a delayed arrival of the aircraft overall service is pretty good i would call it the japanese standard inflight meal was good but the main dish fish was too sweet,4
jal certainly lived up to their reputation for good service the cabin crew were attentive and nothing was too much trouble for them the food was excellent and the seats were very comfortable my only issue is that we had a day flight but we were served a meal at am and then cabin was darkened for people to go to sleep,5
im a tall guy so having extra leg room is always a plus our family did round trips flights from chicago to tokyo and i could be more pleased the level of service as is often the case with nonamerican airlines was quite good with consistent and reliable service throughout the flight whats more i had the most leg room ive ever had on a standard economy ticket,5
was told i needed an escort to my next flight during a layover because of passport issue airline took my passport and boarding pass and refused to return them unless i gave them after hours of arguing because they couldnt justify it i had to pay or be stuck without a passport refused to call embassy after me constantly asking extortion and illegal for a corporation to seize an american passport beware,1
i had travelled on jal long time back in from singapore to kuala lumpur but that was a very short flight lasting only minutes now i got a chance to travel to tokyo from delhi by this airline with lot of expectations it was an awesome experience the cabin the staff the food everything was great above all the humbleness of its staff is something to be experienced the flight too was smooth barring minutes of turbulence the checkin process is unique and very pleasant surprise as compared to other airlines the return flight too was equally perfect hats off to jal,5
in tokyohaneda i used a designated first class check in counter after passing through the security checkpoint quickly i proceeded to the jal first class lounge the lounge was very spacious but crowded a bit and offered a good selection of breakfast food and drinks they also had shower rooms a champagnebar a room with a kicker machine and a smoking room i enjoyed the time during my stay in this lounge after boarding the boeing er i was guided to the jal sky suite a the cabin was not fully booked which was not too bad the charming crew members in the first class cabin introduced themselves with their names and offered some drinks before takeoff the seat was really spacious and clean but a bit outdated which was not a problem for me at all there was also waiting a red amenity kit from porsche design up in the air the service started with an amusegueule of my special preordered japanese vegetarian menu followed by a very delicious multicourse special meal every time i was served a new plate or bowl the flight attendant explained to me what it is consisting of and also the meaning in japanese cuisine i was really surprised of the friendliness and attentiveness of the airline staff which i enjoyed pretty much concerning the drinks i decided to try after the french champagne a pommard red wine which also was from france after meal service was over i was handed out a pyjama and i changed my clothes in the bathroom in the meantime my seat was converted to a comfortable bed with a mattress and very soft sheets by the way in the bathroom they had a typical japanese toilet with a lot of the famous functions toilets have in japan i had a very good sleep above the clouds although i woke up and could order a noodle soup and a pot of tea there was served another delicious vegetarian meal before arrival in london i even could order some stuff from the regular menu at all times very special for japanese airlines is that they offer a good selection of japanese drinks like different kinds of sake wines which i also tried a glas or two from all in all i have to say that jal is a reliable and safe japanese airline which i definetly would fly again with this first class flight was one of the best experiences i made in this class of service not least because of the professionalism of the cabin crew members,5
we were upgraded on our return flight and what a wonderful experience the cubicles were divine i had so much room and was so comfortable for the entire journey the food was magnificent drinks and snacks were plentiful if required flight staff attended immediately once the call bell was pushed the toilets were always clean whenever needed something that is definitely not common will definitely consider a trip in business class again,5
we went premium economy due to our height and we loved it the staff were very nice the food was tasty and we could have endless drinks and snacks fantastic would definitely fly again,5
i booked my flight from flight network i pay for my window seat all the way from edmonton to jakarta somehow japanjakarta is not window seat i asked at vancouver counter gate to help me change it but they couldnt do it even though the window seats are available so they ask me when i arrive in japan i should go to transfer counter after i went for security check at international tranfer theres transfer counter on the right so i went there to ask them change to window seat unfortunately the lady is rejected my request rudely then i showed her that i paid for the window seat even the service at vancouver asked to change it in japan another drama that she talked to her supervisor in japanese about my case still she said no service for economy class so when you are in economy class means no ground service in narita airport i wish i took photo of them,1
undoubtedly the best flight of my life as there were only three people in the cabin the crew recommended we move to another row so we have a full row to ourselves so we didnt even see the other passenger demonstrating the service and consideration wed see throughout the flight they made up the empty window seats as beds so we could comfortably move between seat and bed for the duration of the hour flight the crew were incredibly accommodating and attentive walking us to the restrooms to change into our pajamas talking us through the various menus and letting us alternate between the western and japanese menu i wanted the caviar and sushi the food was astonishing and beautifully presented and both champagne options exquisite wed been looking forward to the flight for a while and it was everything we hoped for,5
just arrived back in melbourne on jl there was a family of about people including children seated around and in front of us for almost the entire flight one of both of the children were screaming or yelling disrupting other passengers the family members did little to curb that behaviour other than to say a quiet shhhh occasionally the children played in the aisle often with an adult getting in the way of staff and passengers although this went on for hours the cabin crew did nothing to intervene given jals otherwise high standards this was very disappointing an additional point with jal is that the cabin temperature is set quite high on of flights we took with jal over the last weeks the internal temperature of the cabin was uncomfortably high,1
having flown several times i can say that japanese airlines generally have great concern for hygiene and customer experience they do not stuff too many passengers like some airlines do their seats are comfortable and throughout the flight they ensure that you are hydrated and satiated i took another connecting flight of jal to singapore and experience was consistent strongly recommended,5
have a recent trip to hokkaido japan is a nice and enjoyable while travelling with jal being a premium economy customer we are allowed to enter to lounges both in singapore and japan international airport which actually allows us to rest inti before the flights the sitting for the class is nice but the cushioning is a little thin it will be great if they can look into it the seats can fully lay off without disturbing the back customers and are perfectly fine and comfortable for tall people like me by the way i am meter entertainment in the plane has a wide selection but the bad point is that outbound and inbound are the same therefore i got a little bored after a while as for the food wise is not fantasy but still good language is an issue to many of us as we dont speak jap but what i have encountered is that the staff have lots of patients and even will go and look for someone who can speak english to assist us on the issues we have as our flight is being delayed but we reach the airport early during the return flights but the staff who cant speak well in english got a friend who is going off duty to help this lady not only help us to change to an earlier flight and ensure all the processes in,4
travelled three different trips to vietnam with japan airlines their service is outstanding and attention to detail is spot on enthusiastic and friendly staff that really make it seem like its their sincere pleasure to take care of their passengers,5
my st time flying with jal cabin crew all are friendly asking how we doing etc its so pleasent comfortable seat for economy in flight entertainment bit disappointed cant really enjoy it because not so many choices of current songsmovies meal its okay i ordered moslem meal moml overall its a relaxing and enjoyable journey,4
awesome airline first time flying with jal and would definitely do again service was prompt and first meal was great second in flight meal had some very oriental options which was not really suited to our taste but the service was outstanding the screen entertainment was also excellent,5
never flown jal before and to some good fares the seats were comfortable with individual lamps couldnt lie flat for sleeping but good enough the entertainment system was one of the better ones and very easy to use choice of programs could be expanded the care package was lovely with toothbrush slippers eye mask face mask water the food was not so great actually there was no dinners when we left at night but a small bun didnt mind that but the bun was not great breakfast next day was dried salmon and rice quite fishy service was impeccable everyone so friendly polite and big smiles,4
everything was just above average compared to other airlines ive been flying with the food was not that great but you get what you paid for they also serve ice creams after meals the best meal was the breakfast one because they served a known japanese burger on board the flight attendants were great and very responsive,4
this was my second time flying with japan airline i really liked their service and their hospitality to their customerspassengers first of all i was happy with jal when i flew with them two years ago therefore i knew i wanted to fly with them again this year my husband and i booked economy seats from kuala lumpur to san diego we were amazed by the leg room they have i was very happy with the interior inside the flight the seats are very comfy and very new i liked the fact that they always providing free toothbrush and toothpaste in the toilet thats a plus in terms of food im not a fan of airline food because i cant eat while im on the flight no matter what airline i fly with i had a hard time eating on the flight i like to just drink a lot of water or nibble on some snacks the flight attendants were very professional friendly and always smiling i really liked that i for sure will choose japan airline again for my next trip,5
although only a hour flight i found jal to be excellent the aircraft a winglet was clean and spacious and the staff were very pleasant from check in to flight attendants free on board wifi was an added bonus would recommend them to anyone wanting a good flight experience,5
booked direct flights from new york to and from tokyo on a jal boeing the price of direct tickets was only a few hundred more than flights with connections so it was a no brainer i am a nervous flyer but the flight to tokyo was smooth as butter we flew north from new york through canada over the bering straight down through the coast until reaching tokyo magically this hour flight over some pretty active weather regions was buttery smooth there was a generous amount of legroom in economy class and a i was able to extend both legs fully beneath the seat in front of me the entertainment systems were ok a very good selection of movies but the music and video games were basic the video games especially were poor equivalent to bad cell phone games years ago singapore airlines has much better games actually using nintendo brand the food was passable dinner consisted of a japanese meal rice sides and a meat dessert was pleasant a cup of haagen daaz ice cream the return flight was a bit bumpier but the staff told us right at the start to expect some light turbulence and made an in flight announcement before hitting a rough patch in the north pacific this really helped to settle my nerves all in all an almost perfect flying experience,4
wonderful way to end a fantastic holiday a little bit more leg room and comfort jal were great to fly with and the lady at check in couldnt help us any more than she did,5
i sit in economy class the leg room and seat are comfortable they provide halal food which is really good the flight attendant are really nice,5
flight from nrt to tpe flight delayed then some taiwan parents did nothing to control their infant four adults in the family two kids one of which was an infant screaming for the entire duration of the four hour flight flight crew did nothing parents and grandparents did very little infants do not belong on flights period selfish parents bringing their infants with them on vacation what is the point seriously and this all was in business class i paid extra for my seat so i dont have to deal with this garbage unfortunately both airlines and parents take no responsibility for this issue bad just really bad,2
excellent customer service and superb food the quality and space of seat in premium economy is almost as good as the old style businessclass before the sleeper seats were introduced and definitely worth the money jal offers a huge baggage allowance each person is allowed x kg checkin bags which really helps when travelling with the family after a shopping holiday the entertainment system is excellent and easy to use premium economy customers can also use the airport lounge my only criticism is the relatively poor standard of english and jals insistence of its staff squeaking in as high a tone of voice as is humanly possible when making announcements extremely annoying and antiquated jal management need to revise this policy and move into the st century,4
i have flown at least times in my life and dozens of times with jal their inflight service is always pretty good the meals are okay but their website and web checkin process is the worst of any airline its so frustrating trying to get through their system confirmation number not valid cant find my booking error error error hey jal heres some advice just copy what another airline does just do exactly what they do figure it out completely revamp your process it stinks,2
flew the dreamliner on the direct flight and for a hour flight it was actually enjoyable the only challenge is trying to sleep as the flight leaves at pm boston local time business class seats are very comfortable and offer plenty of room overall the food was good and plentiful service was very professional and responsive amazing how easy it is to fly across the world,5
flying an american airlines flight operated by japan airlines meant that little or no service information made it through between the airlines systems a window seat confirmed with aa on the phone and showing on the aa mobile app was totally absent for jal so even with a high priced business class ticket i got the dregs of the seats all the jal agents could say was so sorry arriving in dfw i had to ask where the baggage claim was because the two airlines systems couldnt link and update me one world isnt a good thing unless its a good world and from my experience its not,2
the aircraft is its new the service quality is very good when i pushed the call ca they tried to help asap the missing points are the following there is no amenity because this is a longhaul flight the eye mask is helpful breakfast meal is not good taste for me it looks the english breakfast and its only one choice the seat is hard i asked another blanket for the cushion,4
japan airlines sacrificed one seat in the economy class to make seats a row instead of seats a row for many other airlines they also increased the seat pitch this made noticeable difference in the sense of space and the comfort level of the economy class especially when you fly long haul the inflight entertainment is very good with touch screen functions food service is very good quality for economy class and i especially liked their campaign to feature young and rising chefs in japan to come up with appetizers main dish desert etc with a touch of japanese innovation and traditioncabin attendants were very attentive to passengers and take care of their requests quickly and nicely i am not surprised they are voted the best economy class by skytrax for the second time most highly recommended for those who want space and quality in the economy class,5
from check in to fast track exit complete and professional service and the plus hour flight is made to remember all the latest movies food choice between japanese and western and drink menu is extensive and on tap yes you have to pay for it but you only live once for the experience,5
the hours flight became a excellent experience the flight attendants were all superfriendly and gave the best service with a big smile the glutenfree food was served two times and tasted perfect the seats was not the best a little bit hard to sit at som i had took a pillow to sit at the entertainment was just perfect a flight that served the passengers from departure to arrival,5
took this flight for convenience i will never fly jal again for some inexplicable reason they literally cannot ever fly this route on time despite it being only two aircraft from san to nrt and back again check out flight aware and you will see the ontime performance is like no explanation from the flight crew either also this flight goes to narita which is like hours from tokyo i have been spoiled by always flying into hnd and since this airline is a government monopoly you would think theyd offer it to hnd but no nrt it is we bought business seats since first is not available ever on this particular flight we were excited to fly the but alas jal put shell flat neo seats in the plane these are the most uncomfortable business seats ever they are narrow and dont even lay out a normal angle for sleeping they were world class business seats decades ago why jal would put this crap in a new plane is beyond me but for an hour flight it was torture the flight attendants smile alot but beyond that there is not much communication on the way home delayed yet again we had seats d and g these seats should be torn out as inexplicably there is no storage overhead whatsoever and since its a bulkhead no place to put anything ridiculous to have to fight with other passengers to put a bag overhead the food was not good and service uneven i have never seen flight attendants drop so many things at one point a dinner roll went careening down the aisle the clanking and dropping of dishes in the galley was obnoxious for like hours straight for all its faults its back to delta and flying through lax for me,2
attentive and friendly service and good selection of food and drink also good selection of in flight entertainment and the ramen were delicious,5
i enjoy flying with jal even on short flights like that the whole experience was smooth and professional friendly checkin hasslefree boarding ontime departure not even much turbulance along the way arrived in tokyo ontime and rested for my meetings inflight service a cup of apple juice they dont have to provide it but it is a nice touch got a nice big smile with mine too,4
we booked this flight using k american airlines miles each you cannot book this flight on the aa website you must call their reservation number this is by far the best longhaul economy class ive ever flown the leg room and seat width is excellent instead of configuration on most airlines jal uses on economy my seat h does not have a seat behind it so reclining does not bother anyone the meals are excellent and the flight attendants are warm and friendly i recommend ordering the skytime drink its made of kiwi juice,5
japan airlines economy class was comfortable and roomy for someone who is feet and i did not feel cramp the check in process was fast and smooth their website is a bit difficult to navigate and slow the flight attendants was helpful and pleasantly nice they offer some of the latest blockbuster movies to watch in their in flight entertainments the food overall was good lax its lax not much can say with it i did not sit in premium economy but from looking at the seat i did not think it is worth the price upgrade unless it is cheap upgrade free or if you want to sit toward the front of the plane then it might be for you they have a snack area you can get drinks and light snacks anytime you need there is a usb port to charge your phone,4
even though i flew economy on this occasion on a b with seating i must say that the leg space for myself at cm was ample and i did not have the feeling of being squashed in all flight were on time food and beverga service was very good with ample choice and tasty meals aircraft was clean and even after hours the toilets were more or less clean in flight entertainment i would give out of before landing we received a put it together yourself burger which was unexpectedly tasty i can highly recommend jal,4
i had booked a round trip from new delhi to san francisco and back with a stopover in tokyo on our return flight i booked the flight economy class thinking i had a deal did not realise that one has to change airports narita to haneda which involved getting transit visa and additional cost of changing airports with luggage on adding up the costs it was expensive compared to other airlines once i had booked my tickets it was impossible to contact the japan airlines on phone also tried through an acquaintance in japan he also could not contact the airlines on phone i wanted to extend my stopover in tokyo from day to days but could not contact the airlines through various means the flight was comfortable with good leg room the food served was tasty the flight experience was good anand,3
we was travelling from bkk to nrt the service was very nice during the trip for hours seat is comfortable clean inculding movie on borad,4
always the same highlevel of service flight attendants are welltrained to be friendly and attentive to passengers needs,5
we were on a japan airlines flight to narita from vancouver recently the inflight service in the economy cabin was unquestionably better than most of the airlines we have experienced in our travels to asia and europe from north america the cabin crew were so polite and courteous and the meals were outstanding due to severe winds at narita our flight was diverted to haneda airport and as a result we missed our connection to singapore from narita when we finally got to narita we had to line up for more than hours to get another flight to singapore we were tired thirsty and hungry and only after some complaining we did get some water from the ground staff about hours after we started waiting in line since our new connecting flight was some hours away we managed to get hotel accommodation from japan airlines we could take a shuttle bus to go to the hotel but we were told that the airline policy was not to provide shuttle transportation from the hotel back to the airport and the airline would also not provide any meals after some more complaining we were given yen for return transportation but we could not get any meal vouchers we finally checked in at the hotel at in the morning and everything was shut we had to wait till early morning before we could get some snacks from a store outside the hotel obviously we can only blame mother nature for the inability to land at narita on time to make our connection but we think japan airlines could have done more for the totally exhausted customers who had to wait in line for hours,2
the jal business class check in at nrt airport very efficient and polite the business class lounge great with some good food and drink the boarding very smooth the business class seat is not as good as jals oneworld partner american airlines the crews are very polite and helpful i ordered japanese food option but in the end i got western option beef course as japanese option run out the beef is one of worst i ever had,4
im a moslem with family and request moslem meal on the board the attendant serve us first compare to others its great and the kids got a present from them the plane touch down narita on time,5
i recently flew in jl from tokyo to melbourne and the comfort food and beverage and service offered was outstanding jal is a great option for anyone travelling to or from japan or europe as you can spend some time in japan which is a wonderful country i would recommend japan airlines very highly and they are a fantastic option if you are looking for a tier classy one airline,5
my experience with jal is always great last week i took flight from narita to manila i noticed today that i left my tablet pc in seat pocket by mistake i thought it will never come back however when i called jal they quickly found my tablet the aircraft was also great latest aircraft boeing is used for flight light adjustment is very smart and i could rest very well although it was a short hours flight inflight entertainment system was also great with lots of movie and music selections for meals i could enjoy japanese style delicious lunch and hagen daz ice cream as dessert as oneworld sapphire member i could also enjoy sakura lounge service at narita airport where i could enjoy delicious breakfast buffet,5
ive made this trip on premium economy many times over the past years or so mostly on eva decided to try jal this time because of oneworld status and booked through aa i rather wish id booked through jal because pe travelers have business lounge access both at ord and nrt i did not because i booked through american airlines in addition the gate crew at ord was american airlines so of course they were abrupt and boarding was confusing and illmanaged the flight itself was great other than the fact that i found the pe seat unusually uncomfortable compared to eva qantas cathay or lufthansa for example its one of those seats that slides forward in a shell to keep from invading the space of the person behind you but i found that it placed the weight directly on my tailbone which more than a week later is still aching food was ok but not great and the selection of movies was fine without being outstanding i think in all all in all that i would not go out of my way to fly jal in premium economy again if theres a convenient cathay or eva flight,4
shaming company we are traveling one year using a round the world ticket and after already flying more than routes this year we just had the worst check in service in ours lives after more than one hour waiting jal people charged us in usd for ours surfboards here in tokyo while other flight with jal no charge was applied we are traveling with luggage less than what we could have and it is just non sense to receive a charge like that and people behaving really bad someone need to change this rule and staff should focus on customer service not only playing the paper rules we will never travel again with this company ps i am a sapphire customer,1
voted as the best airline in japan but i think it is still a grade lower than the top international airlines the biz class seats are well designed but just a tad too narrow another cm wider will be good the food on the way to tokyo was quite tasteless i think the best is the ramen cup noodle the food on the way from tokyo was much better entertainment program was good with touch screen,3
t first flight with jal and i was quite happy with the service and the seat the flight was hrs in a er if anything the extra room made it unfamiliar to snooze but that is a personal thing we had a meal on flight and two snack options for our hrs there is a drinks and snack station for economy at the rear of the plane there were toilets available for economy in flight entertainment was on par with other airlines but the software running the entertainment was fast no delays when pressing your choices overall i felt like premium economy but sitting in the cheap seats,5
that was my st experience using jal and i love this flight and the service comfort seat even in an economy class and good service from the flight attendant jal lavatory is not too small as a normally flight and they also serve a good flight meals i love jal note this is a very late flight review since tripadv just asking me to write a flight review which my actually trip by jal was on last spring cgknrt,5
traveling long distances is always very daunting but our experience with japan airlines was excellent the service was really superb it was very comfortable and the attendants were very efficient i would always consider jal when traveling,5
the flight was very good and although we left new york hours late due to the snow the pilot made up most of the time on flight i had a connection to osaka and was able to make it flight attendants were courteous and put me at ease with the delay,5
a pleasant flight with very friendly cabin crew this was a midnight takeoff and interestingly they didnt overfeed us like so many airlines do my wife really enjoyed the japanese style breakfast i had the european breakfast and found the omelette very disappointing read didnt eat it i am rating legroom as average below simply because i am cm tall and even in business i can never lie flat and be comfortable,5
a flawless experience from beginning to end the cabin has an intimate feel with only seats on this flight only of the seats were occupied making the flight attendant to passenger ratio the seats are spacious and comfortable not as private as singapore ana or the middle east but still very nice for a hour flight food was excellent and always available wifi was complimentary for first class and fast enough to check email and send texts pajamas were offered but jal typically keeps cabins at a warmer temp so i would advise bringing alternative sleep attire if you have difficulty sleeping in warm temps overall a fantastic flight and wouldnt hesitate to fly jal again,5
my first experience with jal was very very positive flying every year on the long routes from australia to europe and having much experience with stars singapore airlines cathay pacific garuda stars emirates oman air vietnam airlines thai airways malaysia airlines i would rate jal services much better they were good in everything starting from boarding till debarkation it was amazing to see how efficient they were on boarding for example they reserved minutes for it and finished minutes earlier it was the same on my connecting flight in tokyo both flights departed earlier thanks to it and arrived to their destinations much earlier as well all inflight services were very good the aircraft were new and very modern the crew was very nice and responsive the food was the best i have ever had on long flights the aircraft cleanliness deserves a special mentioning it was outstanding it looked like the toilets for example were cleaned after every visitor it is worth mentioning as well that they were in line with japanese standards that was astonishing to see on the aircraft i think that a small addition to inflight amenities would make this airline even better that their star competitors what i missed on their flights were small things like night socks air plugs mouth wash skin conditioner razor and other accessories,5
choosing the premium economy seats was probably the best decision we made for our trip to japan the seats were spacious and comfortable not to mention clean we were thoroughly entertained by the movies provided on our personal tv screen food was good the fligh stewardess made my kids very very pleased by giving them a souvenior from jal and before giving my kids their drinks the flight stewardess drew a doraemon face on their cups it made the children feel special we had a delay in our flight and the ground staff of jal handled the situation very well i did not see one grumpy passenger we had to take a connecting flight and i am pleased to say the quality of service is the same kudos to jal for setting such a high standard for flying in comfort,5
i actually made a round trip on jal to singapore and the year previous to kuala lumpur the previous year the airline went out of its way to make sure that my wife and i got seated together when there were problems with the reservation last year and gave us a free upgrade this year they have had a meal upgrade in both premium economy and business i would recommend that you give jal a chance to serve you,5
pleasant smiling and courteous staff says it all couldnt have been more helpful at checkin nor more pleasant its great to see how culture and training come together to give a flawless outcome the grooming of each staff member was super and customer service seemed uppermost,5
when i fly it is always with jal or ana they are the best having researched them i know about their unyielding commitment to absolute safety and perfect service i heard later on that there was a ca who drank alcohol on the flight i was on but i didnt notice anything thats how good they are so if you have to pay an extra to reschedule your flight last minute thats on you dont blame the airline blame yourself for not planning properly and expecting somebody else to pick up the pieces jal is one of the best airlines in the world,5
i have never flown on jal before nor business class everyone was so helpful and kind the accommodation was excellent and the meals were truly unbelievably good i slept well and was entirely relaxed best flight ever,5
i could have very relaxing sleep on board with spacious full flat sheet for business class during my long flight over the pacific ocean,5
this was my first trip to japan with mh and returned malaysia with jal the checked in process was easy and fast and we were offered the sakura lounge prior to our flight to kul we spent most time in the lounge and the foods offered was excellent boarding time was accurate and flight depart on time the business class has excellent hard products seat was spacious and comfortable together with some nice quality amenities cabin crews service were top notch and very caring to each business class passengers we had a wonderful flight experience with jal and will definitely try it again in future,5
we spent hours on this flight in economy class the efficient at the gate was amazing all staff in the plane was very friendly and helpfulthey really went the extra mile to make the flight as enjoyable as possible even if we were in economy food was actually very good i would take jal again in case i would go back to japan,5
i dont have a good physiquebut the seat of economy class is tight and hard im a bit of a diabetic and on a restricted dietbut there was no food selectioni guess money might have solved this problembut online booking i could find no option at haneda airport i had to wait may baggage delivered in over half houri know this no exceptionalbut a series of misfortune made me sad and fed up,3
as the title says my jal experience was ok neither good nor bad as a premium economy flight it delivered the leg room but the seat was not particularly comfortable the pillow flimsy my video system had a few problems and i found the meals acceptable but uninspiring i was hoping to start my trip with some japanese inspired meals but pe shares the same menu as economy and with spaghetti bolognese as the default main meal for one occasion the menu was overall disappointing they need much more of a japanese theme to their meals there was no priority queue to board the flight but to my surprise the ticket did include access to the qantas business class lounge in sydney which was a great start as we felt very relaxed and somewhat privileged im not sure id fly jal again as it was clearly inferior to my pe experience with cathay pacific in late,3
i was flying home with my loved one who was receiving cancer treatment overseas and the flight staff were very attentive listened to our concerns and provided a special pillow to relieve his pain at the end of the flight several attendants came to say goodbye and well wishes even gave us a special gift of origami crane necklace they handmade during the flight moved me to tears,5
one of the best airlines that i have used to fly to japan price is reasonable cabin crew friendly and welcoming food is good too nothing much to complain,4
very good wine selection good food presented with artistic flare friendly and attentive crew and excellent entertainment selection restrooms remained spot less during flight also flight offered an assortment of anytime meals in case you got hungry,5
the staff was very kind and always happy to help and very profesional diversity for the meals and also japan is one of the most diverse countries,5
i was on the premium economy seat to tokyo for night flight and wanted to see the differences i booked for economy seat for morning flight to kul from tokyo and frankly speaking it was as satisfied as the premium seat although the seat was different and there was no extra amenities the space was still big compared to other airlines economy seat it was rated world first class economy seat and one thing i couldnt forget is how amazing the meal was and we were given a cup of haagen dazs ice cream for dessert imagine when you finished your meal and expected nothing else but then you were given a cup of ice cream and everyone loves ice cream i was enjoying the whole flight that i watched a few movies rather than taking naps till we reached kul certainly choosing this airline again for my next trip to japan,5
jal offered few classes of seat and being curious with the premium economy seat we booked for it for our night trip to tokyo from kul by paying a little bit more than the economy seat and the experience was great as you would have never expected for this class of seat and you get to enjoy the lounge service before the flight first we were seated before the economy seat rows with bigger space different seat extra amenities slipperstoothbrushhair brusheye cover and we have already felt how premium it was the flight crews were all really professional and they were smiling the whole time i guess they have the best smile compared to other airlines not to forget clean lavatories and it has a full body mirror inside since it was a night flight we slept all the way to tokyo and to be honest i wasnt even feeling tired or having body ache after the long flight and the seat must have contributed to this,5
this is our nd time flying on jal in flight service is great hostesses are always waiting to help we highly recommend this airline,5
very clean and sophisticated bathroom huge extra leg even for the economy class great foods love it,5
we travelled with jal again after our last two trips to japan because they were so good this time we were going through to london as an experiment to see if it minimised jetlag it did and we hit the ground running in london the second and third legs of our triptokyo to london and return to tokyo were also very good the best thing apart from the service on jal is their premium economy seats they are in a shell so that you never lean back into someone elses space and they dont lean their seats back into yours,5
flew jal roundtrip jfksin via nrthan upgraded at jfk to premium economy for first leg rest of trip was in economy service was generally excellent throughout the experience boarding was orderly checkin counters efficient premium economy is not really worth the upgrade though food is a little better and you can have champagne but the footrest of the seat is awkward i could not find a good sleeping position at any point during the flight jals regular economy has such generous pitch comfortable seats and good food that premium economy feels superfluous i slept better in three legs of coach than one of premium economy,5
the jal lounge gets very busy in the hours prior to this flight leaving i was annoyed when i requested use of a shower i was was told there was over a min wait for the showers which put the vacant time at the same time as my boarding with mind to go i enquired again and was now told that there was at least another min wait the member of staff running this apologised but offered no alternative so i enquired at the front desk and they suggested i try the american airlines lounge so i rushed over there found their lounge empty and was able to have a shower before my flight why did jal staff not tell me of this option sooner the flights themselves were good i found the seat comfortable i recommend odd row seats a and k as these are the good window seats jal use the ba lounge is boston which was good funny that the jumper was offered on the day flight to boston but not on the return flight from boston ask and it might be offered all flight crew were delightful,5
their flight crew service is excellentthe stewardesses are always polite attentive and always serve with a smile not like other airlines the checkin counter staff attitude to their work is excellent,5
i am writing this as were still over the pacific as we were handed free wifi access codes when we took our seats while its not super fast its nice not be charged for it especially when flying first class check in at jfk was a breeze very friendly staff had us on our way in less than minutes she then walked us to a special lounge adjacent to security there two helpful airport employees helped us remove our electronic devices and carried them to the front of the security line a special tsa employee checked our passports an boarding passes not sure how this works i guess the airline pays for this service shortly after take off we were given very comfortable pajamas and a nice amenity kit the seats are wide and soft leather and will be made up into a bed anytime you request it what was nice is they lay out a soft cushion and provide a down comforter the lie flat bed is over feet and i was able to stretch out very comfortably the japanese set menu for lunch was delicious there were a number of small dishes followed by the main course and a wonderfully sublime dessert the cabin staff is always smiling and are always ready to provide anything you want the bathrooms are cleaned each time someone uses it overall this has been a very positive experience,5
for whatever reason asian airlines are warm compared to american airlines which are cooler my mom was sweating like hell and felt somewhat miserable my dad and i were fine though the wifi sucked though,5
i flew times with japan airlines in a time frame of weeks and all three flights were more or less on time the crew was friendly and my luggage always arrived as well all in all this is everything one would hope when flying so im satisfied with japan airlines services and would definitely book again with them,4
a thumbs up to japan airlines for their service we took the connecting flight singaporenaritasan diego the checkin baggage handling information and flight was quite good the seats in economy class are good value for money and cabin crew is soft spoken and well organized the food served during the flights was of good quality their serving of icecream at the end of the meal was a good way to end the meal,5
from the moment you board and step on the plane the level of service from jal is like no other the staff are willing to look after all your needs the business class seats on the dreamliner were comfortable and it was great to be able to lay flat plenty of dining choices and snacks available through the flight i did not select a meal so cant comment on the food quality in this instance it was cheaper to fly business compared to economy so always check just in case well worth it as it was superior service,5
this is our second flight with jal and again it has again met and exceeded all our expectations what a great airline we flew on the dreamliner and loved the experience what makes this so special is the staff wow they go out of their way to make your flight as comfortable as possible always courteous and friendly and very professional they seem to actually like doing things for you so different from surly staff encountered on other flights love this airline even the ground crew wait in an orderly line and bow and wave you off as you taxi the tarmac food isnt too bad either and plenty of it we love the seats at the back near where the staff sit its quiet and plenty of room to stand without disturbing anyone else we travel a lot and after this great second flight we will always look first to jal before booking flights for long haul flights this is the airline to use the only negative i can think of is if you need to call jal before your flight beware of holding on for a long time whilst listening to the same repetitive music,5
the seat is wide and comfortable the toilets are clean and less occupied since the number of the seats is less than economy class the additional fare was approximately jpy usd this price is quite reasonable for this great facility for a long flight,4
a friend recommended jal and they had a great price for my round trip the friendliness of all employees the speed of checking inand the great service on board made this a great experience food was very good and filling seats were well padded and good leg room and they left and arrived on time stewardesses were ready to answer any questions solve any problems lots of programs movies etc to watch and keep entertained this is now one of my two favorite international flights out of the seven i have flown for the last years,5
this airline is a reflection of the country everything is done right service is great everything is clean and you feel like a guest instead of a burden the seats are comfortable with adequate leg room inflight entertainment worked and was abundant and the food was good with a choice of japanese or western food check in and boarding went smoothly with no problems flight attendants are friendly and are there to help it was a long flight made easier by this excellent airline,5
if you are the kind of personwesterner whof likes working in japan or enjoys their culture of courtesy growing up partly in canada a country of friendly folks who do take a bit of pride in their ability to be polite japan is the level up the airline even when faced obnoxious abusive beligerante and wrong customers they remain professional composure the how i dont know the gate staff in flight is love they offer japanese and western food take some pride in presentation attentive staff actively seeking your comfort its not a luxury airline but they do try to make you think it is with service flown several times around asia to and from japan good clean effective efficient all spring to mind value for money i miss japan so much sumiming up flown more than a dozen times positive experience cant sayou that about my favoured most flown top in airmiless virgin who have been pretty good practice,5
cabin crews were very patient and helpful would come and check if we need any assistance with our child food and beverage was wonderful,5
this flight was in a smaller dreamliner which had business seats theres nothing wrong with the sky suites but what was evident today was that theres not enough rest rooms for business passengers in this configuration instead of the usual there was only it was disappointing as the lack for need to queue for restrooms is the reason i fly business bad move,4
this was my first long haul flight and it was a great experience they made sitting on a plane for almost hours as comfortable as possible there was a decent amount of leg room a foot rest and great inflight entertainment the food was beautifully presented and delicious my husband had to have the low salt meal which was even better than what i had baggage allowances were generous as well free checked bags and a carry on plus personal item were allowed spirits were offered at no extra charge and there was a small snack station on the plane a blanket and neck pillow were great for my attempt at sleep but i can never rest while im flying i did appreciate being able to get cozy,5
one of the best airlines in the world and i have traveled for over years even if you are seated in economy you are treated like a guest from the moment you check in until you get off the plane you matter to jal,5
it was a excellent flight with jal i am not a good traveler when it comes to airport and airplane i have my phobia but i took a promise to be brave when my child was born that i will try my very best to take her on holiday as much as i can i felt safe and comfortable thumbs up,5
hand over foot you can actually stretch out your hands and feet the boeing dreamliner is the best i have traveled in beats the by a mile the self dimming windows are a great invention and the business class seats are comfy food between la and japan could have more selections for non seaweed lovers staff were exceptionally nice this was an american airlines code share one note business class was not available on the phxla route and the was dirty every seat taken smelly ich we paid k for the round trip and the aa agent told us we did not pay enough for business class on the phx to la segment poor customer policy,5
food are ok fare is reasonable on board entertainment is sufficient children below years old are happy with their on board gifts especially the cutlery set,4
jal people are respectful i fell asleep and they tagged me and offered my meal when i awoke and thats great service in economy in addition the leg room was sufficient for my height tho the width of the seats are typical narrow the movies are current i caught up with some great ones,4
excellent friendly and helpful staff from checkin at melbourne all the way during the flight and until we landed in japan our seats were premium economy which were very comfortable and even economy looked pretty good not as tight or as many seats as per other airlines they even gave us travel goodie bags during the flight with tasty snacks in them slippers were comfy for the flight as were the blankets and pillows,5
only if they could be more trained to know english also food quality needs to be upgraded specially for indian food,4
its been at least years since i had last flown japan airlines the business class fare were very reasonable so i decided to give it a try not the newest business class seats but in terms of service food and amenities all up to todays standards first i would like to mention the warm and friendly greetings for amenities i love the cabin slippers and in the washroom love the individual mouth wash packets oral care is so important when traveling the drink menu was my highlight with sakes and umeshu as options and for dining i opted for japanese cuisine presented beautifully a great way to travel to japan,4
the best staffs very friendly and very very accomodating love the food super delicious chair was roomy and entertainment on tv was great ontime and love the boarding process cant wait to fly to this airline again in february of next year,5
not flown yet but amazing business class deals on bacom using ba avios booking months ahead jal offers reward seats to other oneworld partner ffs flat beds in jal suite flying hours honolulu to narita for just avios and oneway also kyoto to shanghai jclass flying hours for avios and cash price ticket osapvg without avios is eyewateringly expensive oneway for such a short very popular international flight,5
this was our first experience flying with jal and it was wonderful the food and service in first was superlative it was intuitive service where your wish was anticipated before having to ask i travel often with ba first class but this is a much better product i will definitely fly with jal again great airline and service,5
after a smooth checkin at the counter i spend sometimes in the sakura jal lounge it may be a bit difficult to find following the sign get me lost the lounge is quite big and is divided into several sections those who love window seats may enjoy the window counter seating that has an awesome view of the runway for those whod like to do some work a photocopier machine and other facilities provided there is also a room for reclining chairs smoking room is also available food is properly prepared and presented and is tasty enough to fill you up before boarding the plane drinks soft drinks wine beer tea coffer are served staff at the gate are very efficient the flight departs and arrives on time the flight is pleasant seat is clean comfortable equipped with necessary facilities legroom is great too staff are nice courteous and willing to help meals are ok not that great but well presented the amenity kit is average though,5
my husband and i recently flew jal for the first time and we plan on using them again in the future our trip was to saigon from san diego and from there we flew to a few other countries on a budget airline i think that helped us really appreciate jal their service was wonderful the seats and legroom were pretty standard and i believe two of our flights were delayed but i think the good service helped me look past all of that i loved our food on the flight to asia and the food on the flight back wasnt bad either they have young chefs that create the meals and they include a little bio about these emerging chefs with the meals which i thought was a nice little touch ive flown singapore airline for a flight to asia before and that was obviously top notch but i would say this is a good second place,5
jal has serious problems we arrived at haneda via qantas to onwardly fly with jal to london however jal refused to recongise my qantas issued business class tickets to allow access to the jal lounge even though we were flying business class with jal to london unbelievable similar to my previous report jal cannot be trusted and dont bother trying to argue with jal airline staff whose english is quite poor and obviously do not understand the real meaning of honouring codeshare partners as part of their one world partnership i am guessing we will have the same problems all the way home again jiggidyjigrigged off to have another arguement with jal about my return flights wish me luck,1
jal operate s which are comfortable and clean on the tokyo sydney route this flight departed and arrived on time the staff were the usual very pleasant japanese ladies who smile and go out of their way to assist the meal was good but not always up to business standard on some other more competitive routes,4
i hope that this review helps you because it contains information that i wish i had read prior to flying with jal which i have decided is the best airline i have ever flown with despite a lot of difficulty at first concerning being seated with my spouse for a very very long flight from san francisco to haneda tokyo to ho chi minh city vietnam and back i booked on jals website fullprice for two economy seats not on a code share at the end i expected to be able to select seats but i was not given this option this is not too uncommon for american carriers often you have to wait until hours or however long to select them online but because my husband has a painful medical condition which required him to be on medication while flying i wanted to be seated next to him to be able to assist him with coping he is fine to fly medically but his condition does require meditation and coping skills which i have been trained to assist him with and again requires that he be on medication so he is a little out of it when he flies we picked jal for our first long flight due to its outstanding reputation however we are not wealthy people so we had no real choice except to fly economy jal wound up being a fantastic airline but their customer service phone line and seat selection is horrible and we will fly with them again in the future because we intend to go to japan and several other places in asia especially after he found the flight tolerable for his condition but i will get to the good part of the review after the more negative and frustrating part so after i had entered my credit card information i was unable to select seats for us as anyone would i immediately called their phone number which in the us entailed waiting and waiting and waiting for many hours dropping connection several times and taking days to get through i considered cancelling the flight but felt with jals reputation that once we reached someone it would be resolved finally i did reach a customer service person on the phone and i was told i could check in prior to the flight online hours in advance and we could get seats together i briefly mentioned a medical issue being the core of my concerns but i did not belabor it simply trusting in the process and reputation of the airline hours prior to the flight i logged in and was unable to select seats still i again called jals customer service number and i received the information that it was hours in advance and to be sure to log in to the moment i queued up to log in to the website which was extremely complicated to use with many different pages nested strangely but i managed to log in within one minute after hours and there were no two seats next to one another we had been seated separately my spouse began to have a tremendous amount of fear and to suggest cancelling the entire threeweek prepaid vacation to vietnam i called again to the jal customer service number again waited in total i believe i called and waited for about hours over about five months to jals customer service people i finally got through to a representative who said there was nothing he could do he was terse and he said we should arrive at the airport early we live almost three hours from the airport but we arrived four hours early anyways there was a customer service agent at the checkin counter for jal fortunately but she was unable to assist and said she could only make a recommendation we waited in the line so that we were first to checkin for another hour and then the next customer service agent said the flight was overbooked and she could not assist either but to ask at the gate at this point my spouse looked like he was not going to get on the flight at all but he soldiered onwards i was so profoundly disappointed that nothing we had done had helped us simply get seats next to one another so that i could comfort him during a painful stressful time at boarding they again could not assist us and so we boarded the flight in separate cabins i found myself in a middle side seat next to what appeared to be two fairly young people perhaps college aged and i wound up asking the young man next to me if he would switch seats for a price and what price it would be and i said i would with extreme sincerity that i would not be upset if he said no because it was a long hour flight he said for he would allow my husband to sit in his seat so i gave him and they switched i think that was a fair price i would have been happy to give it directly to jal but they did not allow us to upgrade or anything my husband found his condition considerably less painful than expected much to our tremendous joy and he enjoyed the flight he loved jal as did i we flew from sfohanedahcmc and then from hanoinarita and took the limo bus to hanedasfo so thats quite a lot of flight time with jal we enjoyed every moment with them and my husband found his medical situation tolerable for a flight of this length so we will assuredly be taking more jal flights and we even signed up as members i asked finally why we couldnt switch flights since i could not find anything online about this except for people using miles or on codeshares and i wanted to avoid the problem in the future the jal in tokyo easily explained that the economy flight we selected was something called nclass a term i dont exactly know or understand but it must have mentioned it to me somewhere during my booking and meant nothing to me at all since its not a familiar code so my review is to let you know a few things as a traveler if you want to sit together for a flight do not book nclass flights on jal not only can you not change your seat you also cannot even upgrade jal has serious customer service problems on their phone lines in the us and have room for improvement there take jal anyways i always fly economy i always hate flying and jal is absolutely the best airline i have ever taken the food is amazingly good with a wide and changing menu plus great drinks and everything is free the staff onboard are incredibly nice and professional the seats are comfortable and large even in economy the inflight entertainment is excellent with top us films that change regularly they give you real pillows and blankets the captains were kind and present upon boarding the actual boarding process was a breeze the airport at haneda is easily my favorite airport in the world due to the great shopping food and concept in preboarding and narita is also an incredible hub with a train station to tokyo or narita right underneath and luggage check everyone is so kind and friendly and helpful and the entire plane is comfortable and classy and clean with a large percentage dedicated to sleeping seats it felt like luxury or maybe just civility to be able to fly this way as though we were flying back in the early s when airlines still took a sense of pride in their work as more than just cattle cars but i will find a way to ever avoid nclass tickets again i dont quite understand yet what these are but i will be googling soon also avoid the bassinet row thats where we sat a few rows behind the bassinets which is where they wisely offer families with young babies seating on the way back from hanoi incidentally there was no way at all to check in online for anyone in economy but in that case we arrived to the airport four hours early again and we got the best economy seats on the plane since we were first in the us being first did not assist at all i believe that they always do put families together that seemed their priority a grown husband with a medical condition who was still cleared to fly seemed a little harder to explain the urgency about but alls well that ends well we are now jal members and if you can afford the liedown seating i would take that although i didnt find much difference that i could see between priorityeconomy and economy we flew in economy i do sincerely hope they improve their phone customer service and website both are beneath the status of this carrier,5
few airlines can perform both with great service and ontime departure and arrival online checkin really helps ease up the line and the stress for travelers the meal is far best compared to all economy airlines servicing same routes absolutely the best service overall and will definitely fly again with jal,5
this was my first time with jal i was deciding between ana and jal but eventually decide to give this national airline a try it did not disappoint me first the service was as good as or even better than sq secondly they were extremely caring and customer centric mine was a midnight flight and my experience with other airline was meal served after two hrs regardless of the timing but jal only served small snack after we come aboard and served breakfast two hr before landing this allowed the passenger to get enough sleep i must commend their seats more spacious than many other airlines it was comfortable but only thing is their cushion was a bit hard when we reached tokyo for a domestic transit we just need to deposit the checked in luggage after we cleared the custom and the luggage can be picked up at your destination airport very customer centric and make it convenient for us i will go for jal from now onwards whenever i am travelling to japan,5
booked flight with jal and as no direct flight from manchester they arranged for a finnair flight to helsinki which was fineto connect with jal flight to tokyo the service was above and beyond the usual economy flight the air stewardesses worked hard all the way through the flight making sure everyone was looked after the plane was spotlessly clean food drink snacks and entertainment were very good would definitely fly with them again,5
this was my first time on jal since i had a negative experience they well and truly redeemed themselves seats are comfortable with lots of leg room nice food they had a menu which was created by young japanese chefs cabin crew were so helpful the only negative was that the inflight entertainment didnt change at the end of the month so the selection was the same in both may and june,5
be extra careful with your luggage two expensive backpacks were soaked wet with fishy smell liquid which ended up damaging our personal belongings gifts and souvenirs japan airlines will not assist with your losses if it does not fit perfectly in their description of luggage damage policy according to the jal representatives there are many passengers transporting undeclared products such as fish and seafood that can cause this type of big problem in your trip be prepared to protect your valuables no wonder why they emphasize waterproof luggage in the japanese stores when buying a new bag,3
this was our first time flying premium economy and it was worth every cent entry to the lounge made the start to our trip much more pleasant the seats and the screen were very large and there was a leg rest that came out to support your calves and also a foot rest there was a reading light in the seat and the entertainment was good the staff were very polite and friendly and the toilets were the largest id seen on a flight we were given a snack bag with chips water a pastry and a tim tam as well as the usual amenities pack i would definitely fly with jal again,5
this entailed two flights one from helsinki to tokyonarita airport and the other onto sydney both flights are over hours long with a hour layover at narita overall quite a long and tiring flight from start to finish jal is a wonderful airline very punctual and the hostesses cannot do enough for you food is either japanese or western and quite filling planes are spotless definitely recommend,5
thank you ff milesit was absolutely amazingthe flight was goodi expect that regardless of classhowever st class on jal is wonderfulthe seats are wonderful you bed is made up with a nice mattress amenities are very nice the service is superband the food and drink is better than superb they pride themselves on the foodwith good reasonthis flight made the tripthank you jal,5
we chose this flight after much reviews this was the only nonstop flight haneda airport is much closer to tokyo we were able to get reward miles with a partner airline jet blue hopefully this will materialize somehow we assumed jal had a great reputation now for the complaints we generally fly business class when it is a long flight we can compare this to past flights the flight was delayed hours and we were not informed japan airlines does not have its own well stocked business class lounge in jfk this was totally unexpected the lounge was overfilled and we went to another lounge at the airport the design of the business class seats were designed after a rectangular casket with a hard floor they ran out of food seems as though i am whining but it was not worth the extra expense and could have done better,1
i was very lucky to be upgraded to premium economy on the return flight from japan on the dreamliner i had traveled over in economy on a brand new boing and i was very impressed it was very comfortable with good food the usual great service from jal but the sky premium was just a notch above in both the seat level of service i would be more than happy to travel on either,5
whenever i have flown domestic services in japan jal is the one to choose first class service and extremely efficient embarking and disembarking procedures,5
the flight was on a new and was a good example of how jal runs their airline staff were pleasant and courteous the meal as good as it gets on aircraft these days and the flight arrived on time baggage always comes out fast a good airline,4
flight left at midnight which is not great but the meal was light and just right breakfast into narita was tasty service is restrained and polite in japanese way but excellent will use them again,5
new hrs in the air and service was greatlike a previous reviewer mentionedone of the best international flights i have ever had if you are taking a cruise out of yokohama best to fly into haneda airport much closer but this was booked through holland america and the price was much less,5
the flight was very good as was the return leg from narita to bangkok good service reliable and new b planes on both legs food was also ok as far as airline food goes,5
recently flew premium eco return to tokyo staff fantasticfood goodseats excellentairport lounges greatespecially at narita i have even decided if i fly to europe again ill go via tokyo on jal ps i have flown business class and even iston emirateslast year to paristhey managed to lose my luggage in dubai and not even an apology yesit was all very luxurious but you cant beat jal premium for value for money,5
the flights from nrt to cgk and back were nice and uneventful the planes were pretty new and the staff very good service even in coucheconomy i was told that jal is the only airline that offers umeshu for free that is plum wine i tried it and loved it the food was surprisingly good and i enjoyed them and the snacks too i used the wifi and thoroughly enjoyed the entertainment selections cant expect anything better than my flights with jal loved it and will fly it again soon,5
our flight was suppose to be on am tokyo time but by the time we were checked in on am we were informed that the flight was delayed for hours and we were given meal coupons as compensation after we dropped our baggage we spent the time to travel to the narita city visiting the shrine then we returned to narita airport to have lunch using the coupons the departure was on time as per delayed etd the flight was nice and the food was also okay we travelled with our year old baby so we specially ordered a bassinet for her all is good no complain,4
seat space is very generous for me m height height for my husband and my year old can sleep comfortably head on my lap and feet on my husbands lap food is great no delay,4
always flew delta whenever we flew from ph to us via narita but tried jal because they had a direct naritasan diego flight instead of naritalasan diego seating space was slightly more comfortable food was a little more palatable than what im used to and they offered more choices on the tray there were less english movie choices but it was interesting to watch the japanes movies overall its the little things that made this flight more comfortable than my usual flights i liked the array of pockets in front where i can store water gadgets and magazines separately service was lovely flight attendants were always nice and respectful despite the long flight best of all bathrooms were remained pristine even at the tail end of the flight with toothbrushes and ammenities laid out of you inside will definitely book jal next time i fly west coast,5
from the time you approach the checkin area a personal assistant greets you and takes you through the checkin process each question is greeted with a bow the boarding area was thickly packed with people attendants walked through the crowd with signs in three languages to inform us of which rows were boarding and when making the entire process stress free on the plane the overhead bins can swallow lots of carryons the seats were modern comfortable blankets pillows and noisereducing headphones were all standard i flew on american airlines and we were packed like sardines airbus is the right term as you need to bring everything you want on the plane jal provides it all foodservice you get a choice of a japanese meal or a western meal along with complimentary alcoholic beverages this is definitely the way to fly the choice of movies was astounding as well as games music and tv shows go japan airlines the flight attendants bow each time you ask a question they show up within seconds of pushing the call button the lady next to me used this service quite a bit they are in a league of their own,5
although a very long flight i was pleased with the comfort of my seat flight attendants were well organized and service was excellent,5
we flew jal from haneda to sg changi on may my wife lost her glass case on plane we wrote to jal cust service they responded swiftly and advised us they have found the lost we collected the lost case in sg jal thumb up jal cheers adam nic singapore,5
jal gives us a not so nice in online reservation at first we might have make an error even we have selected gender male but thought it should auto populated as mr but required to select respectively it took us to make changes from ms to mr to reflect it correctly on my boarding pass this has to go through via email and phone call to make this small change we believed this needed to be improved in term of online application system should auto once we have choosed correct gender nevertheless jal boarding check in counter was a hassle free with quick n tip top check in services plane services was great too still will select jal as an air carrier to japan cheers adam nic singapore,5
thats quite good there are so many new arrivals of the entertainment movies and every time depart arrival time is on time,5
my husband and i have flown jal from perth to sapporo and return for several years now and have no complaints we usually fly qantas from perthsing singperth and i can honestly say that theres a significant difference in leg room price wise we choose jal due to the luggage allowance pc kg checked plus kg carry on a no brainer since we take our own ski gear we like the large variety of food although the actual food service is somewhat slow due to their attentiveness of each customer the staff are kind friendly and helpful,5
absolutely great schedule leaving sydney at am and arriving at around pm in narita great timing because you can connect to onward flights or do a stopover in narita very nice cabin service although a huge imbalance of men and women in the business cabin very few women were in the cabin making me want to pull my screen up and invoke my privacy option japanese men slurp their noodles and soup be warned however this is a very good value flight recommended,5
i sat in skysuite a next to the window on this particular jal flight skysuites afford good privacy when the dividing screen is up this was particularly important on this flight as i was astonished to be just of women amongst more than male travelers in this cabin and therefore valued the privacy i also thought that the flight attendants pandered to the male passengers or maybe it was because they were more demanding i was thankful that the privacy factor was so good in this aircraft configuration and i really like the personal suite entry corridor meaning there are no legs to step over having used jal business many times over the years my only other disappointment is their menus which always consist of a japanese or western menu the choice rarely deviates from fish or beef which i find monotonous however this airline has an impeccable schedule it has the ability to depart an airport up to half an hour late yet arrive at its destination on time i also find all their schedules socially friendly and connect well their prices too are good value against the top tier airlines yet seat and cabin comfort is in many cases superior excellent comfort and value,5
my passport fell out of my pocket while i slept and disappeared under my seat the purser and all her staff were very helpful trying to locate it while we were flying but it took very prompt support from a technician who dismantled the seat within minutes of landing to find it great service,5
im someone who doesnt like flying or airports so travelling business class is a must on long haul flights though ive flown many times this was my first on japan airlines and i was pleasantly surprised there was more storage than most other airlines and seemed more space maybe because of better design the cabin crew were first class and the inflight meals were excellent for dining in transit the whole experience had a fresh feel as some other well known brands are getting a little tired and it shows,5
great crew very professional and friendly they worked hard from the start of the flight until the end however for those passengers who order special meals they will not get the ice cream the airline attendants will hand the ice cream to only passengers who requested normal meals i did not like this and a couple of passengers became upset with the ice cream issue perhaps jal should come up with a better way to distribute the ice cream aside from that and horrible turbulence that lasted nearly four hours the airline is worth the money,4
ive been to asia many times over the years and knew what the long flight entails my wife has never been that far on a plane and wasnt sure what to expect after hours of flying time she was very impressed we selected the premium economy seating for the full round trip the seats were very spacious and comfortable we had over movies to choose from plenty of music choices along with games to keep us entertained on the screen as well the cabin attendants to me are the very best in the business theyre always smiling and super polite even after hours into the flight they all were very pleasant and happy to serve this is how an airline should treat their customers all of the food options were great too traveling by plane is no longer enjoyable as in years past and can be very stressful however japan airlines has giving me hope that there is still a friendly and comfortable way to fly out there other airlines should follow their lead if i could give six starsi would simply the best,5
nice and friendly service good video device delicious food and comfortable seat are there any other choces i think the answer is no,5
the flight going over was on american airlines nothing special typical aa service the return flight was jal seats were wider and more leg room flight attendant service was excellent,5
roomy seats great movie selection only advice is dont rely solely on the meals they serve some really weird meals i would pack my own before the lounge in tokyo was great so eat there but the lounge at jfk was the air france lounge which was a complete embarrassment,4
i was tired and was looking forward to a rest on my trip home then the guy next to me sits down with a babe in lap great well i was lucky in that this was the best behaved babe on the flight in that he whined a couple of times for a few seconds until dad gave him what he wanted and a few times his foot relaxed and fell on my seat then dad pulled it back like i said i was lucky that this babe sat next to me as he actually didnt bother me at all i am glad i wasnt sitting next to the two or three other babes on the flight that were bothering me for a good portion of the flight it seemed they were tag teaming so at least one of them was crying also i am more comfortable not reclining my seat and when the seat in front of me is reclined i found it hard to focus on the tv screen as it is too close to my face,4
i have flown on many different airlines and different types of planes i must say that this had very little room for my feet under the seat in front of me because the electronics box for my entertainment screen took a generous portion of the room for my feet there was plenty of room for my legs but not for my feet other than that i thought the flight was very good i would think that this was a thing and not a japan airlines thing,4
it was around hours no snacks plenty of offers for beverages but for a hour flight an option firs acts would have been great staff attentive,4
time and time again we were impressed flight service but yet always treated pretty horrible by jal ground staffs whilst some a friendly most of the time we get snobbish slow moving stone faced ladies this time served by a lady named kobuchi who spent lengthy minutes rechecking our travel documents like we were criminals been to japan times and immigration is always a breeze jal please train your staff on international travel documents and somemanners if they wish to thorough in their checks this is my last jal flight,1
the service and food were exceptional getting on in melbourne after midnight the main idea is to sleep and wake up refreshed in tokyo,5
i took the flight jl with japan airlines jal from tokyo japan narita international airportnrt to honolulu hawaii hi daniel k inouye international airport honolulu in march with a boeing in a seating configuration and the flying experience was a very positive one the flight was long haul about hours and the flight attendants provided excellent service served meal and also generously coffee snacks and beverages alcoholic drinks free of charge the given amenities were very satisfactory the seats were very comfortable having enough legroom sky jal widerincreased seat width to make the journey really nice and enjoyable japan airlines jal is a member of the one world airlines alliance considered to be one of the best airlines in the world and has gained the recognition of customers collecting many awards and accolades over the years eg for jal has been voted asias leading airline asias leading airline for economy class for business class and also for first class etc and continues to enhance the quality of the services provided i enjoyed my flight with japan airlines from tokyo and honolulu and i will fly again in the near future if the opportunity arises,5
we always travel jal when traveling to either the uk or europe for a few reasons jal service is always excellent the on time commitment for the majority of times is achieved you can break your trip at an airport hotel with a good nights sleep meal thrown in on the ticket price and jal is still the cheapest business class fare i have been flying for over years with jal and would recommend the air line to anybody,5
jal experience was all good and better than ba with whom we flew home the jal was code share so good opportunity to compare we had seat allocation at booking and on check in were given lounge access an unexpected bonus new seats in premium economy were good and new reclining system excellent food was reasonable but not fantastic but service from crew was excellent good flight haneda is also much better to fly into with monorail and train access to tokyo much quicker than narita,4
i have flown this route many times japan airlines provides a consistent experience in both their hard product seats meals and very helpful attitude of their employees the seats in business class for this short flight about hours are not lie flat and the window seats do not have direct aisle access typically these arent problems for a short flight the boarding process was a stress free experience on this particular flight there were high winds at narita forcing multiple landing attempts the pilot informed us of this possibility shortly after takeoff it was useful to know this in advance,4
while we had some language problems with the flight attendants they went out of the way to help while most airlines have a hour window for special meals jal is however aa sent a note to jal and jal came through the flight crew was attentive friendly and actually seemed to care i was impressed that being said there could be better coordination with aa for executive platinum members sometimes the oneworld benfits get lost it also sucks to get stuck litterally at the back of the plane as an elite flyer,4
my wife and i flew to japan on jal a couple of weeks back in economy class we flew on the which was new and comfortable service by the jal stewardesses was quite superb so polite efficient and friendly hard to believe we were in economy this was as good as business class food was excellent too possibly the best flight i have ever been on and i have flown extensively over the last years,5
after living in japan for five and a half year the one thing i miss the most about japan aside from the food is its super advanced toilet and i did not expect that japan airlines would actually bring that toilet experience onto its flight literally the amenities those buttons gosh those buttons and the cleanliness screamt japan and it almost moved me to tears as for the rest it had just the right legroom space entertainment was plenty enough for an hour flight and the service was overall nice not a big fan of the inflight meal but it was paid off with a great glass of umeshu,5
getting onto a flight from japan to new york and realised that japan airlines had put a mobility impaired man in the aisle seat with my partner and i on the window and middle of course everyone has a right to travel but my question is whether they support dangerous seating conditions with tow able bodied people to now have to navigate over someone who cant move out of their seat if there was an emergency or fire where evacuation was required we would be stuffed literally he wouldnt be able to get out in time and we would have to physically get over him or assist him to get out this is a highly dangerous situation which japan airlines condones unfortunately qantas did a very similar thing before and after complaining realised it was a fault in their system that shouldnt allow it very disappointed with japan airlines you may wish to rethink your journey with them,3
wonderful experience the attendants went out of their way to make you feel comfortable ive flown many airlines and jals team understands what customer services is unlike other companies out there,5
cabin crew are excellent there service is the best they always try to maintain the cleanness of the toilet the movie on the plane is new and variously for choose the last thing i will recommend is the meal on the plane its worse than ever and let us feel a little disgusting,4
the flight attendants were very attentive and smiled all the time during the last two hours i slept and missed the last snack they left a purple note as a reminder to let them know if anything is needed that was really thoughtful the food meals are delicious and healthy they even made rounds for tea coffee or juice from time to time i like the attached cushion on the seat head and soft pillows more comfortable leg room was more spacious and has stainless footrests the bathroom needed to be cleaned often during the flight,4
booked aa but flew jal because of codeshare was glad i did cause got the chance to experience jal and experience what others were sayingsurely it was a long nonstop flight but the service food inflight entertainment for economy class is on par with all the other asian airlinea lot better than their american counterparts,5
on line check in is permitted only h in advance and unfortunatelly despite beeing on the same reservation my husband and i didnt receive two seats one near to the other weve been lucky that a passenger has been so kind to switch his seat with my husband otherwise we had to fly for almost h one far from the othter on the web site is also impossible to book a special meal company doesnt offer such a great service on ground too because the phone service for the domestic flight hasnt english speaking attendandts so you need to talk to an interpreter who translates you what the attendant says and vice versa a never ending phone call japanese food on board is pretty good while the western isnt that great on board assitents are very kind and polite,3
having almost always flown singapore airlines my family decided to try jal to japan the price was slightly cheaper compared to sq we were pleasantly surprised to find that the seats were slightly bigger than normal with good leg space cabin was very clean and the food was nice my family actually finished the meal although it was an am flight there was no breakfast but lunch was served hours into the flight the only other meal served was a small snack at about hours before we landed of course there were no lovely singapore girls attending to us but the stewardess were very warm sincere and polite service was very good perhaps a better command of the english language would help as the flight was filled with well behaved japanese it was very quiet and comfortable no inconsiderate behavioural nor people talking loudly etc we will fly jal again,4
great attitudes warmly welcome cleanliness nice food comfort and most important i got sleep well in plane,4
never again jal we have travelled with many an airline but your deception has spoilt our travel even before we have left the ground our booking was planned months ago business class for a conference but jal has allowed the timetable to be hijacked what we didnt realise is that even though it was clearly a jal booked itinerary nevetheles one section was covertly copartnered with british airways who cancelled their flight throwing our itinerary to buggery what was a one stop travel intinerary has now become three stops what was only hours travel has become filled with lengthy layovers extending the travel up to a possible hours given jals short notice and a conference committment there was no option for us to cancel and jal has not indicated any compensation arguing that it was bas fault who argued that it was jals fault with no real explanation this corporate aerial pingpong with no apology or compensation is seriously frustrating and distressing which indicates a lack of care for customers who become vulnerable victims at the mercy of jalsbas corporate whims which actually costs customers time and money having to adjust budgets accommodation reorganise work and meeting schedules and even family committments etcetera etcetera jalba it is not good enough we your customers demand that you stick to your committments accept responsibility and the consequences of your actions that can decimate your customers plans and compensate us accordingly rather than cowardly whimping and leaving your customers to pay for your mistakes,1
from the moment you check in to the moment the plane pushes back from the gate the service is impeccable the boarding time for an entire international flight took less than min and we were on our way we flew out of yvr and stopped briefly in nrt on our way to sgn we will fly jal again and recommend it to anyone flying along the pacific rim,5
not recommended to choose jal the staff at kansai airport counter were very slow to handle baggage queuing for one hour to finish baggage check in,2
useless call centre in hong kong lied to us about what dates we could change our tickets then said sorry and they will not charge us but charged us anyway they leave you on hold for minutes while they calculate the fee difference but each come up with a different number for the same day,1
the night flight from kuala lumpur to tokyo was comfortable and the crew was very attentive but the cabin was a bit too warm love the premium economy sits and extra spacious toilets from tokyo narita to kuala lumpur was great the sakura lounge was very packed but organised food was good as usual the crew was very attentive continues flow of drinks and food love the cup udon haagendazs icecream and bread cabin temperature was just right the awardwinning prawn curry rice was good too,4
excellent service and flight tofrom south korea to tokyo its been many years since i flew jal last trip was from sfo to hnd on a which was very long now the new tech planes help take traveling easier this was our half trip to japan and loved the great service courteous staff and nice flight short trip from gimpo to haneda but flew in a huge boeing dreamliner that had lots of leg room and great meal service which was unexpected considering the flight was only hours for the money we paid about double what it would normally cost but that was because we were heading to tokyo for the cherry blossom viewing sakura luckily we had already eaten at the airport lounge and did not have too much to eat on board on time performance and easy gate location on both ends made the flight that much more enjoyable,5
this is our second time with jal the first time was last year flying from vancouver to manila the service is very good from checkin until we got off the plane the cabin crew are very attentive to all the passengers and always smiling our seats are wider as compared to other airlines the cabin smells fresh the food they served is what i liked best i have no complain with the quantity and the quality they start serving the miso soup before they serve the main entree and you can ask for more soup until youre satisfied the last they serve is ice cream aside from the dessert included on the food tray coffee and tea are nonstop and i even requested for decaf for dinner my only complain on our nd flight was the washroom because towards the end of the flight it was already dirty maybe because it was a very full flight and the attendants were so busy attending to all the needs of the passengers thats why they had no time to makeup the washroom i hope it will not be the same on our next flight back to manila this coming august nevertheless its still our favorite airline and well keep on using it as long as they offer reasonable rate,4
japan airlines codeshares with finnair and we found both the airlines very good the route traverses russiasiberia near the north pole and the experience and scenery itself is a treat helsinki is a sort of northern version of the middle east transit terminals but much more relaxed and less frantic there are two stops at tokyo and helsinki but the waiting time was short the trip only took an extra hours compared to the middle east routes and in my opinion is worth the extra time the business class prices were several thousand dollars cheaper than the comparable middle east routes the planes are modern and the cabin crew service was excellent,5
i flew jl b nrt to lax in business in may check in at nrt airport was smooth and helpful being oneworld emerald i was able to use jl first lounge there are two at nrt airport the one next to customimmigration is more crowded than the other side of terminal the only notable difference between two locations was sushi the other side did not offer it but if you like less crowded more relaxed environment id recommend the far side lounge departurearrival were on time as always jl offered one of the best services in the class i like the mattress availability of extra blanket many food options and you can eat whenever you feel like up to two hours before arrival entertainment system is top notch another great experience with jl,5
i have been boarding jal since i moved to australia their service has been improved since a few years ago especially meal service is excellent especially we can enjoy nice japanese cuisine also full flat bed sheet provides private room for each passenger wifi service is available with good connection strongly recommend this airline when going to australia,5
the dreamliner service on this route is very good and certainly a great way to get from australias east coast to europe jal staff seem to expect passengers to fit and remove their own seat mattress also the little cardigans they provide are strange the japanese menu is highly recommended the downside of this route is japanese immigration at narita,4
we took our first trip to tokyo from jfk i was nervous about flying that long before you knew it we were high above the clouds and the flight attendants started serving food but first in typical japanese style warm hot towels for washing your hands not boring airline food but tasty and distinctly japanese also miso soup as well then they even served häagendazs ice cream after a little nap they came around with delicious sandwiches and then finally another meal before we landed this time it was pasta with the most delicious creamy sauce totally worth not counting the calories on this flight it surely made this long flight seem very short our returning flight from narita to jfk was exactly the same as in great however this time around they pulled off entirely different meals except for the beverages and miso soup everything else was completely different and completely delicious and this was in economy class can you imagine what they serve up in first class the flight attendants were cordial kind efficient and pleasant inflight entertainment system was great as well dozens and dozens of movies and tv shows if we ever have the chance to go back to japan we know we will only be flying japan airlines,5
not so many latest movies and music compare to other airlineit had a lot of explanation in the programme too much hospitality,3
i had a rush need to get to europe hence buying the first available flight what a surprise and contrast from my qantas flights from brisbane to tokyo the difference was chalk and cheese qantas at best waste best mediocre whereas jal was sensational the staff were polite attentive and made you feel as if you were important to them the in flight entertainment was great as was the food the choices and the variety japanese as well as european on my return to haneda i had an overnight staying at the airport and a day in tokyo brilliant if i had to use one word to describe the trip with jal flawless cant wait to fly jal again,5
it was superb female stuff were all flawlessly beautiful and polite and attentive it is quite common knowledge among us this is the best airline within our country but it was far better than others and it felt as the customers were better crowd and i did not get the annoying and inconsiderate normal crowd who will do unbelievably rude things and they acted much better and that was important for me that there was no disturbance in that way or people around us have better sense or selfconfidence around them and not bother people in a horrific way that we see on the news i did not see any fight or people abusing others like on youtube videos every time i have to go home from the states i would choose this airline,5
jal have checkin security and flight connection procedures down to a fine art what a pleasure to deal with their staff they are courteous beyond belief the aircraft was whisper quiet and the cabin crew and service were outstanding well done jal we will certainly travel with you again,5
it was inevitable to be delayed due to the bad weather but they made late announcement and kept changing gates which was annoying by having said that flight was smooth and short with professional cabin crews i have lost my headphones in the airplane upon arriving at oita but they kept it for me to retrieve except bits of miscommunication well recommended airline,4
their flight attendants always serve you with warmest smile and kind hearted they walk all the the time to serve your drink and food the toilets restroom are always in a clean condition and nice smelling the seat was clean and neat the plane arrival and departure is always on time the food are delicious and lucky me i got the food menu from the chef competition many choices for drink try their originally juice from japan my son only complain about the lack of anime movie in the flight entertainment that using english subtitle only available,5
travelled to tokyo and back on jal punctual and efficient extremely courteous service with excellent food choices good clean cabin and spacious seats for a change were seated togetherwithout having to pay the return flight from tokyo was to leave at am all passengers were offered food and drink in the lounge to avoid disturbing sleep on board excellent touch strongly recommended,5
i cant click to rate legroomseat comfortin flight entertainmentcustomers service and the rest i would give points for all of them flight was delayed one hour plane stayed on runway for one hour before take off on the way back to melbourne no reasons offered besides all communication are in japanese with minimal english translation meals are basic very hard to ask for a glass of water we offer to refill by bottle but they refuse just give one child cup at a time they are not happy as we asked for a lot of water to hydrate,3
hotels in tokyo are expensive particularly if you are visiting in cherry blossom season i dont normally fly with jal because the cost is relatively high but this flight departs from haneda at in the early hours this gives you a full day but saves night in the hotel also its a lot cheaper and quicker to travel to haneda than narita even a taxi is affordable if you have luggage the airport is also quieter and smaller with only international terminal if you can sleep on the plane the timing is good and easier to recover from jet lag finally its in the same club as ba so you still get your air miles i spent more on the airfare but saved an expensive hotel had less hassle and got home early the following day,4
our eight hour flight to tokyo was very comfortable and satisfactory the customer service was excellent our every needs fulfilled the seat was spacey and comfortable making the flight a convenient experience two thumbs up for jal keep up the good work,5
i am normally a star alliance flyer but for this particular holiday to kyoto and tokyo we found a great deal on jal and wanted to give it a try both the outbound bkk osaka kix and inbound from nrt were dreamliner but the biz class configuration differed the outbound to osaka was the traditional jal shell flat seat without partitions which i thought was dated the return flight from tokyo featured their sky suite which was a great deal better recommendation is still for aisle seats if two of you are traveling together both flights were on time on board service excellent food pretty good met all expectations that i would expect from a japanese carrier two criticisms first was the limited english language capability at narita airport check in counter one would have thoughtand secondly for some unexplained reason which remains unexplained by jal to this day i couldnt pre select seats on my return flight to bangkok on jal website will certainly fly jal again if the price is right otherwise have to stick to star alliance for mileage purposes,4
on our most recent flight from japan to la we decided to fly by japan airlines from narita transportation to narita was quick and easy we used the airport limousine bus which stops at many hotels in the tokyo area we boarded the bus at the ana intercontinental hotel the cost for the bus is less than taking the narita express and frees you from having to push your way through tokyo station and navigate nearly half a dozen escalators the bus dropped us off right in front of the terminal the line at the checkin counter moved quickly the staff noticing our stroller we were traveling with our threeyearold daughter opened an additional terminal to get us through more quickly security was efficient and polite when the flight was ready to board we were allowed to get on early we found our economy seats large and roomy with lots of foot room the size you might expect on economyplus at another airline each seat had a blanket pillow and headphones the inflight entertainment monitor had a good selection of movies games and music however the headphone jack was the kind usually found on airplanes the twopront variety it worked well with the cheap airline headphones but i had to be careful not to bump the jack when using my bose qc headphones or the sound would cut off our flight left the terminal ontime but it took nearly minutes of taxiing before we finally took off the larger seats and headroom were much appreciated on our hour flight to la and even more appropriated on the andahalf hour return flight the flight passed quickly enough the inflight meal was airlinemediocre but we had brought food for the flight from a shop at the terminal arrival al los angeles was painless and we got through immigration and customs quickly the only problem we had was our primetime shuttle which never arrived to pick us up or half a dozen other people who were also waiting we had to spend for a taxi to get to our hotel in orange county avoid primetime shuttles at all cost a month later they still havent refunded our payment though they promised an immediate refund getting back to our flight japan airlines gave us comfortable seats good service and a reasonable price i highly recommend them,5
one word old everything is so old in the plane it is so dusty and we kept sneezing and who serves cup noodles as a meal for business class service is ok but the quality is poor seats are comfortable for business class but they should really revamp their old planes,2
so it turns out im not a great flyer mostly takeoff but i couldnt speak more highly of jal from check in to landing ive never been treated better in my life seats comfy as flight crew friendly and helpful and the food omg better than most restaurants will definitely fly with japan airlines again,5
this was a sensational experience the staff a very friendly and the service was second to none would not hesitate to flight jal again,5
i recently took a flight with jal for the first time to see if heir accommodations are worth the premium plane fare than those middle eastern airlines the food is at par exceptionally great like those middle eastern airlines well prepared very good presentation sumptuous and worth the calories however in the amenities side jal lags behind double row window seats and quad row for the aisle no privacy despite the raising divider your seat sinks to the ground when you want recline you could imagine the dirt on floor near your face i think jal is old plane and should be retired those middle eastern airline are much superior in comfort and price much lower so would i take jal maybe if its a new plane that offers single row window seats that doesnt sink to the floor,3
wanted to try jal as theres hardly discount for jal and usually flew with cheaper airline to japan turns out the difference between ticket for pe and economy seat is just sgd oneway so forked out additional sgd to get better comfort its all worth the extra money as they allow to use loungegive priority for luggage additional amenity and significant legroom compared to economy class however boarding was together with economy which i thought could be adjusted in the near future i flew other airlines but jal has two additional features which i dont see in other aircraft tiny foothold under everyones seat which crew used to step and reach out to overhead compartment normally i would just step on the seat mirror in overhead compartment which allows you to see if any luggage was left out without the need to peak inside this feature is very helpful for petite and short individuals food was good and sufficient entertainment to survive any flight one disheartened event for me is when jal refused to compensate my damaged baggage claim definitely wouldnt fly jal again due to its high price and unwillingness to extend customer service,4
the dreamliner plane was spacious seats are nice and wide and the service was impeccable they ran out of one of the options for lunch which was no big deal as both options were nice and gave us an apology treat they really go above and beyond to make sure you are comfortable during your flight would not hesitate to fly with them again and recommend them to everyone,5
jal continues to provide exceptional attention to service in terms of courtesy punctuality comfort care for its passengers regardless of the class of service seating arrangements in their aircraft has placed long haul passenger comfort at the forefront of their travel arrangement well done jal thankyou for an excellent journey,5
excellent airline on all segments flights were on time or early no other airline ive flown with can board and unboard passengers so quickly amazing food was great too seats were comfortable and spacious enough,5
a pleasant impression flew with jal children are prioritized in their flight when you start checking in flight counter you can request kids meal for your child but the rule is supposed to tell a few days before your departure date passengers with babies and children are prioritized to board the plane first inside the plane you are also friendly greeted by the flying attendant and will be informed if there is available kids meal for your child for the baby will also be asked if you need bassinet or other needs such as diapers for your baby toys from jal as compliment also available and given as soon you reach your destination,4
in april several friends and me took flights from singapore to osaka to attend business meetings and took chances for sightseeing during sakura season we prebooked the flights with transit at tokyo in december because it was one of the cheapest commercial flights available then while i dislike the longer routes with transit of about hours in narita however i enjoy the free meals and generous luggage allowances offered by jal the transit at narita need to check because it is from international to domestic terminals vv of about hours are sufficient and smooth on inward bound journey arrival at osaka itami airport is also nearer to the city then kix overall i enjoy the excellent inflight services by jal,4
its my favourite airline so far food at its airport lounge is good seats can go down about degrees for the premium economy so i could get a good night sleep spacious enough to stretch my legs and i m metres tall service onboard is prompt whenever you asked for something even for a pen the aircrew always get back to you quickly and are always with a smile and very ready to help unlike sia but the food onboard need to improve a little kind of tasteless and blend throughly japanese service i would always choose jal if they have flights to wherever i want to go to,5
great airline with courteous staff and good food seats are comfortable no problems with checking in entertainment is good,5
air crew were so beautiful nothing was too much trouble and they were very attentive we elected the japanese meal option which was very nice especially the sake and a great introduction to japanese food cabin was older tvs smallish and bed not so comfortable,4
we flew economy because my wife and i like two seats together and jal have two four two configuration in economy the bowing dreamliner was very quite and the cabin staff were excellent looking after our every need because of the long distance we decided to stopover at narita and this was a great decision as it cut the journey time in the air in half and we arrived in moscow refreshed and ready to go having had a good nights sleep in a hotel close to the airport great airline and great way to do this journey,5
this was the best flight i have flown on the is a great plane the seat leg room was better than an a the service was great as was the foodbeverages the entertainment wasnt as extensive or appealing as i have experienced but i did find things to while away the time flying again with them in nov so that is my endorsement,5
i took the flight jl with japan airlines jal from seoul south korea incheon international airport icn to tokyo japan narita international airport nrt in march with a boeing on a row seats and i really enjoyed it on the ground everything went smoothly although it was necessary to take a shuttle train to the boarding gates the take off was on time and on the air all the crew has delivered excellent service although the flight was not long haul about hours the flight attendants served generously both snacks and drinks free of charge the seats were comfortable having enough legroom to make the short journey really nice and enjoyable japan airlines jal is considered to be a very good airline as different awards prove it eg for jal named best economy class airline seats for the second time in the annual skytrax world airline awards at the paris air show the first time was etc and continues to try hard to provide excellence service i enjoyed my flight with japan airlines and i will fly again in the near future if the opportunity arises,4
once again i chose jal to fly from sydney to tokyo and home the service was immaculate with very courteous and attentive staff amazing food and good entertainment fellow travellers were very considerate too probably because you feel so welcomed highly recommend this airline,5
not as spacious as a but well laid out in business class with comfortable flat beds and very good service food was ok complimentary travel pack basic,4
very comfortable seats with lots of room food like economy but that is ok plus access to lounge at airports luggage came promptly,5
the legroom in jal premium economy is great seats fold back into themselves so you dont have person in front taking any of your space the space in between the seats mean even if you are in a row you dont touch the other passenger plenty of seats for couples definitely worth it food is the only let down,4
brilliant food and service staff charming and kind in flight entertainment all worked properly dreamliner is great aircraft and very comfortable,5
the journey was a pleasant one as the seat and legroom are spacious the screen is also bigger than the other airlines i only watch movie during meal time and had comfortable sleep throughout for meal it was quite a nice surprise to be given steel utensil and not plastic ones and the best part even the planes toilet was installed with electronic bidet,5
very good flight we will fly jal again the food was good and service was good i can recommend this airline,4
great service and i slept very well after seeing good films the food was delicious and just the right amount i feel better after flying in the dreamliner i think it must have something to do with the air plus it doesnt seem so noisy or maybe it was because the earphones were so good,5
decided on my first flight from gothenburg to helsinki that i needed to do some more work and get some good rest during my flight to tokyo so in helsinki i located the japan airlines service desk and upgraded from economy to premium economy cost was fixed at euros thought is was a bit hefty but in retrospect it was worth it the seats were wide the table big the food really good and the amenity kit helped me on a couple of good hours of sleep no problems with space for my legs im cm and i also enjoyed the size of the ife screen only minus was that the in flight announcements cut right through the movie i was watching at a nonadjustable volume which was really loud with my headphones otherwise highly recommended,5
one of the best airlines in the world inflight entertainment and food are also phenomenal they really try to the fullest for their customers at all times if you have any chance to fly jal do not think twice recomanded,5
japan airlines is by far the best ive ever flown with from little details such as disposable house slippers for the flight and the quality of the packaging of the meals which were also of superior quality to bigger things like the friendliness and service provided by the flight attendants jal is always going to be my goto airline when traveling to asia,5
very good service on time well organized check in boarding and cabin crew very efficient and helpful,1
its a longhaul flight basically its difficult for the body however it was minimum the cabin sheet and equipment are new and not tired the cabin temperature is slightly warmer although i called an attendant a few times they took care of my calls very smoothlythe food service is nothing special but its enough the outstanding point is in a washroom i used it several times it was always clean the crew tied to maintain the washroom constantly and i guess that the passengers are also trying to keep a clean themselves generally speaking nobody does not want to defile the cleanness,5
extremely friendly stewardess which i think is a japanese custom but i was served by a good looking stewardess who is very friendly and smiling while serving it adds a bit of bonus with that kind of gesture and service toilet is amazing it has that latest technology flush just like what you expect in any toilets in japan food is definitely amazing top notch when i went to the toilet i saw the stewardess took a big bamboo pot of rice out and mix them so you can imagine fresh hot white sushi rice since mine was a night flight i went for a snack food japanese style it is served to me in a small course bento ish with rice surprise to see that much of food after hours flight they start serving lunch where i chose japanese meal this comes with a bento of cold sushi and other cold dishes follow by main course where i had a grilled salmon with rice and some condiments i totally enjoyed my flight experience on japan airlines the only downside for this airline is the headset it doesnt really provide that much soundproof and i didnt like the way they packaged them up in a cheap plastic bag would love if they could put in a nice headset cover as if you are using the bose headset overall i give on my experience,5
the aircraft was a new and was comfortable and clean the flight departed on time and arrived on time and the staff were typical jal ladies courteous and pleasant the food on this leg is very good as jal have to compete with others so they do it well maybe she was tired after the long flight but the senior attendant took an order for the second meal and then completely forgot about it not to jal standards,4
long haul flights arways are always trying but this flight and crew made a long haul flight relatively comfortable the crew were attentive as japan air always are there was very little turbulence even the food was well presented and tasty,5
their operation is very puncutal and the staffs are very polite so yu can feel yourself upgraded you should check in advance from which side you can see mr fuji and book a seat of the side in winter you can see the best fujicovered by the snow,4
the seat is very comfortable because the seat is made from rather and very kind for my daughter for example elaborate airplane toy are presented,5
my husband and i travelled to and from tokyoheathrow with jal on our honeymoon the seats are incredibly spacious and comfortable with one of their planes offering seated aisles as standard no awkward middle seat the quantity and variety of their movies and tv shows is insane youre spoiled for choice the staff are incredibly friendly and polite i didnt get on with the food on both flights and the staff were very apologetic and as we were departing they apologised again really great service the main downfall unfortunately is the food except for the soba noodles on the return flight there are very odd combinations and if youre near the back of the plane the only decent sounding option is unavailable choice was fried chicken or prawn curry can you guess which one was left over all in all i would definitely fly with jal again but id make sure to bring some snacks,4
once again we had the opportunity to fly jal japan airlines to tokyo their premium economy is excellent and value for your money on the ground you have access to their business class lounges both at dfw and narita the dallas lounge is very basic where the narita sakura lounge is twolevels and has every amenity you can think of in the air jal had the same high level of service as we experienced previously the premium economy seats are comfortable have great legcalf support as well as a foot rest since the seats slide forward rather than recline backwards there is no problem within a reclining seat interfering with the monitor or tray table food continues to be extremely good well presented favorable and high quality there are several choices in addition to snack service and a snack bar if you go hungry its your own fault the flight attendants are attentive pleasant and appear to really enjoy serving their guests yes i use the word guests rather than passengers we look forward to our next jal flight,5
very nice helpful and polite cabin crews yummy meals throughout the flight spacious seats and hassle free checkin and boarding love it,5
in april of this year my wife and i used the services of japanese airlines when flying from moscow to tokyo we used the services of this airline for the first time and our flight took place on the boeing dreamliner t was an unforgettable flight on a beautiful plane with a great airline business class seats allowed for a hour layover sleep drinks and food were excellent both japanese and european dishes were offered the flight attendants were nice and helpful my wife and i express our sincere gratitude to the japanese airlines company for the wonderful flight as usual i express my gratitude to yandex translator for the preparation of this post because english is not my native language,5
wonderful compartment seats that turn into beds they put down a pad and give you a comforter and pillow the service was outstanding and the food was the best ive ever had on a flight would highly recommend on the way to japan we were in business class and it was very good,5
jal operate relatively new s on the melbourne tokyo route and do a good job this flight was on time the service was friendly and polite as you would expect the meal was average but it departs after midnight which is a negative so most prefer to sleep you can do a lot worse than jal,3
the pilot is superb the legroom is comfortable the service is great with regards to food staff and the timeliness of the scheduled flight if you bought your ticket through american airlines and you want to upgrade your ticket jal will not allow it until you call aa the problem with that is if you you are flying when us offices are close you are out of luck,5
i was expecting refined service and comfort in jal business class but found neither cabin crew was mostly matter of fact or indifferent with one exception one does not feel welcome as on other flights from different airlines more important six hours into the flight i had an excrutiating pain in my right leg not a leg cramp and called the hostess who had no idea what to do thankfully one of them knew about thrombosis and got me pillows to help raise my leg and drain the blood so i do feel most jal stewardesses are unresponsive and untrained for emergencies layout for business class cabin is charmless extremely partitioned it felt like a cheap office building and made me claustrophobic seating was not entirely comfortable as i felt squeezed like in a cubicle entertainment quality is good but tv screens are way too big for the space its overwhelming and you cant help being bothered by your neighbours lit screens while youre trying to sleep poor air quality poor accessories eyemasks turn hot when you open the package which is absurd and not relaxing especially when the cabin feels stuffy they should be cold if anything so i could not use it to block the light from a tv across the aisle all in all jal business class was inferior to that of other airlines ive flown i was very dissapointed and will not fly them again nor recommend them to anyone on the positive side ckeck in was fast and the food was excellent,2
i could stayed on airplane very comfortable thanks to polite staffs and clean seats but on way back to japan they asked me to move from narita airport to haneda airport to take domestic airplane it takes hour by bus which requires expense about yen in addition if they have such a bad connection they should note me before booking i was really satisfied with jal by narita but i was regret to choose the company after haneda,2
on my night flight from melbourne to tokyo i thought the beds were very hard on my return flight from tokyo i was offered a mattress just wondering why no mattress was offered on my initial flight i had not flown japan airlines before but had traveled on other business class airlines on the return flight we were given a towel but no drinks for two hours and then i was told there were no western lunches left my daughter and her two daughters flew economy on the same flights but had no complaints,3
the gate and inflight service were both well executed the drinks meals snacks and entertainment were great it made a very long flight very enjoyable i would gladly fly with japan airlines again,4
i was on the pm flight from sfo to tokyo on may i was stuck on san francisco traffic for a long time while in traffic i discovered i left my passport in the hotel i stayed inonce i reached the airport the ticketing staff already knew who i was because everyine else was already at the gate waiting to board by this time it was already and told the ticketing agent my scenario and told them someone was bringing my passport she asked me where they werewhich was minutes awayi knew i wasnt going to make my flight but to my surprise she said you will make it if the passport is here by pmat three the passport arrives and she took care of everything including have me swished through by another agent through the long security lines all the way to the front and on to the boarding gatewow now that is service in its upmost besti was too much in a hurry and didnt get their names but i wish japan airlines reads this review and commends the two special staff members one lady and one young gentleman that helped me so very much i salute your service par excellance and will recommend your airlines to everybody domo arigato gozaimasrichard nazareth silva of san francisco flight jpn to tokyo continuing to bangkok thailand on may at pm again i thank you so very much matane,5
from the time we purchased tickets to the time we left the gate the service was exceptional crew was well dressed courteous and professional food was actually delicious and enjoyable staff always smiled lots more legroom im and this was in economy everything was very clean and smelled good i got the feeling they actually wanted you to be there this was such a nice contrast to the terrible service and attitudes of pretty much all airlines in the us i will make an effort to fly with them again,5
was able to upgrade on both longhaul flights which was well worth it plenty off leg room and wider seats in premium economy staff are very pleasant and attentive it was a pleasure to fly with them,5
overall i had pretty high expectations for my flight that jal did not come close to meeting first the pluses the skysuite seat was good for sleeping and with a window seat provides great privacy the plane was very clean in relative terms many negatives though the food japanese meal was pretty bad not as bad as some other airlines in business class eg british airways but easily worse than most american carriers for a comparable length international flight in business class the food was overcooked much worse than what youd get in a moderately good japanese restaurant in boston service was basically on request only the mandatory service items meals duty free etc were offered but nothing proactively beyond that if you rang the call bell and asked they were happy to comply but compared to for example jetblue mint the service level was much worse the lounge in narita on my return trip sakura lounge was just plain bad no food other than rice crackers and cheese balls and very crowded the amenity kit and other onboard amenities were very basic for example no moisturizer in the kit or in the bathrooms the blanket offered was very thin and not warm at all no storage available at the seat at all the only option during takeofflanding is storing all items in the bins overall i would choose just about any other airline over jal for a business class flight unless you have no choice on the route in my case they offer the only nonstop so i dont have other good options,3
after arriving at narita with plenty of time for an early checkin on a very damp day we were disappointed to discover that none of our group of four were sitting together our friends had been allocated seats a couple of rows apart whilst my husband and i found ourselves situated some rows apart not a good start to checking in our friends on complaining were advised that the flight was fully booked and it would not be possible to make any changes fortunately when i spoke to the staff requesting that my husband and i could be seated together it seemed to take a short phone call and we were reallocated new seats side by side and with the bonus of plenty of leg room needless to say our companions were not impressed other than that we had little to complain about and we did enjoy having metal cutlery to use for our meals we did wish the plane could have been scheduled to arrive into changi at a more sociable hour as it was not great to reach our hotel at am to find we had been transferredupgraded because of maintenance issues however realise not always possible to suit schedules of all passengers,4
i booked my tickets through british airways from london to tokyo and was really excited when i saw they partnered with japan airlines for my stopover in frankfurt on my return to london for a business meeting i arrived early on the day i was to fly because strangely they didnt allow me to book my seats in advance like british airways does when i asked the very polite girl at the desk if i could sit with my business partner she couldnt have been more polite to offer two middle seats one in the front of the other thinking that would suffice she was sneaky about it to because when i asked she implied it would be no problem printed the tickets and was starting to load my luggage however when i looked at the numbers i noticed they werent in the same row and asked where these were again with a sweet little smile she politely said they are in the middle seats one in front of the other i was a bit confused since im almost six feet tall and needed to be seated next to my colleague to discuss our strategy and meeting agenda i asked again if she could please reconsider and give us twoseats together side by side again she was very polite made a phone call but only had the middle and maybe a window seat but nothing together i explained we were on business and asked her if we could possibly upgrade to business since i have a ton of miles and she said no they dont take ba miles even though they are partners some partnership i asked if i could buy an upgrade and again was told no i became frustrated and practically begged the woman for anything but the middle seat she had the one window seat which i gave to my colleague and then she just got rude with me and told me to either accept the middle seat and get out or just move on and get nothing i explained i didnt understand why she wouldnt let me pay for an upgrade but she just got more obstinate and told me to speak to british airways i asked where the ba desk was and she didnt want to tell me she just said its in the terminal which by the way is the size of six jumbo jets the frosting on the cake was when she said with a smile and her most polite voice is there anything else i can do to help you i was floored seriously what help she made it clear she was not going to help me nor did she want to help me help me off a bridge maybe she was very rude and left me feeling like a criminal i left after that and walked around aimlessly to find ba but couldnt i later found out that ba doesnt open until pm my flight departed at am i decided to call ba and explained my frustration but they couldnt help accept to say sorry and suggested to ask the attendant once on board i did only to be told my friend could take the other middle seat in front of me they had nothing together otherwise i saw a ton of open seats in business too but they wouldnt let me upgrade even when we boarded the plane they seated our section last really last when my colleague and i finally were allowed to board premium we were pushed aside last minute for another japanese woman in economy i got the distinct feeling we were pushed aside because we were foreigners too and that just made me feel sick to my stomach needless to say vvi will never fly with jal again theyre nonservice service faux smiles fake polite voices and disgusting food made me sick i was extremely disappointed with them and will never fly with them ever again they were the worst,1
one of the best airlines in the world sakura lounge is seriously the best except cx lounges service is outstanding inflight entertainment and food are also phenomenal they really try to the fullest for their customers at all times if you have any chance to fly jal do not think twice,5
flight from laxnrt was a great flight even though it was in economy the seats were more roomy and comfortable than us airlines with a lot more legroom food was good and flight attendants outstanding and helpful entertainment system had a lot to offer and it worked well comfortable flight than departed and arrived on time will fly again,5
i flew jl lax to nrt in may imho jl offers one of the best business class travel experiences food options beverages comfortable seat entertainment overall service was outstanding the only missing piece is not offering pajamas instead they offer some jacket to wear during the flight which is fine but id prefer pajamas asked for extra blanket and got it without any problem temperature was comfortable and b aircraft was relatively quiet although i was sitting right next to the engine qantas first lounge at lax wasnt crowded and very comfortable overall excellent flying experience,5
jal departed from jakarta cgk to tokyo nrt on february they are still using the boeing for this route which is they provided skywider seat in economy class the seat was wide and the legroom was awesome but the seat cover quite rough and makes it uncomfortable especially on the headrest when it ajusted the meal was excellent one of the best in the air,5
pros friendly flight attendant cons food is bland in flight entertainment is so so some movies no english subtitle check in long waiting time ground staff not approachable paid high price on this flight but im not satisfied wont be flying with jal again,3
cabin service was nice and very attentive food presentation was great but the taste is normal seat was clean and comfortable but the seat are not full flat bed boeing overall fight was good with great service and value for money,4
this was my first flight to tokyo and first time on jal a colleague of mine flies to japan frequently and recommended jal as being much better than ba what i found out was the just like many airlines business class has become ok nothing special the crew was really nice and welcoming but the facilities and the food where just ordinary would i fly with them again yes would i look for another airline in a heartbeat,3
would like to say thank you to the entire jal team for a flawless trip to bangkok from boston and connecting through tokyo narita from the airport airport lounges and especially the flight crews they exceeded my expectations in kind friendly and professional service i would also like to thank american airlines as i booked through them they assisted with getting my seats reserved i recommend this airline,5
in the air cabin service was great not unexpected as jal cabin service is great fa are very friendly and attentive to your needs my surprise was with tickets that i bought jal has a j class which i was led to believe to be business class j class is really a premium economy class biggerbetter seats located at the front of the cabin found out at haneda airport from jal that there was only a first class lounge and boarding for j class was last entrance to the plan was from the front away from the coach boarding area so it was no bad this must be jals general boarding plan just not familiar with it overall experience with jal was ok with the great in flight service,4
i have taken this direct flight from boston to narita several times as part of trips to the philippines the service is great it is a long flight and they go out of their way to make passengers comfortable there are three meals on the flightand the food was very good,5
i had no idea airlines treated customerstravelers this way the flight attendants listened to us and went out of their way to make our trip special whenever possible the only thing about the flight we would have changed is to fly business or first class next time and that is because of the flight time to japan there are games i was listed as on the tetris top leader board movies flight exercises these actually helped flight information shopping ebooks and tv shows i watched three just released movies and a panda special total on the way to japan and back a dinner was served breakfast and two snacks with beverages available the whole trip also a pillow and blanket were provided for the duration let me just comment that if jal flew domestically i would be on the flights,5
flew family of on the dreamliner v with sky wider economy seats great leg room and seat width excellent entertainment choices and fantastic service always with smile the flight attendants went out of their way to make sure toddlers in the group had a great flight although hour flight was a smooth ride loved the windows which you get to adjust the shade darknesss level will fly this specific flight again,5
weve flow jal a few times now starting in economy and now in business its one of my favorite airlines in economy the seats on the transpac flight from sfo have a whopping of leg room and are very comfortable in business i was worried about the configuration on jal but the seats are amazing they are fully lie flat and extremely private roomy on comfortable i slept seven hours on the flight from haneda to sfo earlier this year and on the recent sfohnd flight i think i got fully eight hours food is very good i ordered the japanese menu and the quality and variety is delicious the sakura lounges in asia are typically top notch sadly the sfo lounge in sfo was quite a disappointment but i have yet to visit a lounge at an american airport that is even as good as a typical lounge at major asian airports all in all jal is a great airline,5
although the jal lounge at suvarnabuhmi airport is nothing special and quite busy the service starting from boarding the plane at bkk all the way to disembarking at tokyo was absolutely excellent on the six hours flight there was a choice for japanese or western meal the japanese meal was tasty and well presented accompanied by an excellent sake the business class was clean and serviced and the crew worked tirelessly throughout the flight with absolute dedication trying to please everyone in the full cabin kudos go to jal for the impeccable service,5
japan airlines gives excellent attentive service in premium economy it also gave us access to the sakura lounge which had excellent freshly prepared food we ate our primary meal in the lounge prior to boarding the flight and slept through the meal service on board the seats slide forward rather than recline back and are not as comfortable as some other premium economy seats,5
i am and seat space is no longer what is was an economy flight to japan has me in serious discomfort the width of the jal premium economy is only an inch or two wider but it is the pitch you are paying for and they deliver in spades i could fully stretch out my legs and the recline was enough to allow decent sleep to happen im not saying it was bliss in the sky but a huge improvement food is the same as economy which is excellent with pergaps some extra drink options thrown in slippers and fancy headphones thrown in too a very strong recommendation if you are flying overnight it will be hard to go back to regular economy,5
the flight and staff were great although a long flight it was comfortable and the food was really good the premium economy seats were very nice and had more room than economy they give you an amenity bag with toiletries and a pair of slippers to wear during your flight each seat has its own personal tv with free movies and games will definitely fly jal again,5
i recommend flying jal out of seoul gimpo as the smooth checkin and boarding is easy on the traveler in the airplane service is great and our shedule was respected with punctuality,5
i love this flight i live in the boston area and this is the only direct flight to tokyo which means no hassle return connection through the usa its such a hassle if you have to go through immigration and customs at the first usa entry pointconnection that said the service on the flight is excellent and the food is the best ive had in economy the plane is a new dreamliner and is very comfortable the timing of the flight departs at pm is a good time slot at logan because their arent a lot of travelers at terminal e international terminal security lines are small and not a lot of people in the terminal it arrives at narita at pm which is early enough to still easily get to your hotel via any convenient transportation limo bus or express train,5
not a fan of flying probably iike most people flying jal recently restored some faith especially in customer service flights over and back on time and really quite pleasant excellent selection of movies plenty of food which was quite good and staff were excellent flight over a bit better than return mainly as the pa announcements a bit annoying mostly in japanese and were more frequent on the red eye special it got a bit painful these werent safety announcements by the way included flogging even more souvenirs n duty free i really hate this i think people have plenty of time to shop without doing it on the plane trips really wish airlines would not do this,4
flying with japan airlines turned out to be a really wonderful experience comfortable spacious seats delicious food and great service one of the most pleasurable flights in my life,5
i had two flights from jal from gimpo korea to narita and narita to chicago ohare and i have nothing but good things to say in gimpo the staff let me know i had an extra bag check in available and helped me save by dividing the bags under weight and made my trip easier by checking in the second bag i had as a checkin the boarding process was very quick as well it was a short hour flight but the plane i was on had big leg room so i could store my long bag under the seat and got food too for a short flight as well as drinks were offered at various intervals in narita i arrived hours early because i wasnt sure how the checkin process when i didnt speak japanese at all but the staff was very helpful and let me check in my bag early the staff helping was also very respectful and courteous when i had questions to ask luckily i didnt have a passenger next to me on my flight so i had plenty of arm room but the legroom was spacey for economy flight food was delicious snacks were offered near the back where guests could grab at will and also were handed out rice crackers and bread and also got drinks at regular intervals the back part of the seat was a little bit too stiff for my liking but they do give you a neck pillow you can use for your back as well so it worked out one of the best if not the best flight experience i had with both flights,5
great service but the line to check in at the airport was outrageous a giant hall with snakes of humans for various airlines the lines were so long you couldnt tell where it ended up i must have stood there for minutes,4
this was our first time flying japan airlines and it was a great experience by far the best and most comfortable flight ive been on my boyfriend who has flown plenty more airlines then i have brought japan airlines up to his top the meals were great and so was the service hope to fly with them again sometime soon,5
the staff at the airport were very helpful and so politeon time performance was great as well as the service on board the aircraft the meals were great for airline meals i would recommend this airline to everybody will definitely fly with jal again,5
food was great japanese hospitality from the stewardess were just as expected great service seat was comfortable didnt get much from inflight entertainment cause im the sleepallaway type but my partner who couldnt sleep was satisfied with it,5
such a wonderful surprise the layout for club is amazing as no one has to climb over anyone the space is well planned huge t v screen so much store space great goody bags and for the ladies soft comfy cardigans on our return could only get travelled plus and was concerned but that was unwarranted as the internal part of the seat slide down so comfy and fell asleep for hours service cleanliness fabulous and toilets to and bigger than normal so if u had young kids more than enough space thanks jap airlines for your service,5
brilliant hours flight with friendly crew and cabin staff who really looked after passengers needs with seating at there was more leg room and seats seemed wider with no additional payment for specific seats meals were served at appropriate times and food was of a decent quality refills were offered and staff were attentive to passengers needs important little touches included the provision of toothbrush and paste in the toilets prior to landing and the toilets were kept in pristine condition without reservation i recommend jal and would certainly fly with them again compared to the codeshare with ba for our return flight which was appalling in every way travelling long haul in economy class with jal was comfortable with excellent service,5
it was a perfect trip on time service was high standard and very pleasant willing to do anything for the kids and us,5
my wife and i flew on a new in business class the layout is totally odd its the aisle seats are ok the window and centre seats are totally boxed in hard to squeeze into and largely devoid of storage space japanese meal is very good western meal so so the pillows are japanese style and if you have not experienced that before imagine a rock cm thick and youre in the zone service is friendly but formulaic the cabin temperature was set to degrees hottest ive ever experienced on a plane and there are no individual air vents just to make things slightly comical instead of giving out pyjamas go qantas they give out cardigans hardly useful as the sweat runs down your forehead,3
i had not flown jal until this flight every aspect of the trip was first rate the boarding of the plane was orderly and pleasant though the departure was delayed a few minutes ulitmately we arrived early the cleanliness of the aircraft to include the bathrooms was very impressive i am a bit of germ phob so cleanliness is very important to me the crew was extremely friendly and professional they were proficient in their responsibilities the food was good the seating was comfortable and all of the equipment operated i will fly jal any time i have the opportunity,5
very good customer service the plane was an older plane so the comfort levelof the seats wasnt great they offer a western menu in addition to asian,4
when i last travelled on jal from melbourne to tokyo return i found the food inedible during the months since the improvement has been enormous when making the same trip in april i found that not only were the vegetarian meals in both directions better they were in fact delightful couple this with comfortable and spacious economy class seats excellent service competitive pricing and on time performance you could not go past jal on close inspection of the premium economy seats i could not justify spending twice the money for the same flight over economy well done jal,4
good friendly check in shared lounge with qantas is excellent even though busy dreamliner seats are comfortable although the window seat has little headroom and it can be difficult to get out with the leg rest up the extra window size is excellent and the light adjustment works well try the japanese meal its excellent light and just right for a day flight we would fly jal again,4
japan airlines is renewed for its sophisticated attentive but also nonpushy discreet quality service as well as the quality of its insight meal services i tend to enjoy authentic japanese course but to my delight i tried french fish course from ny to tokyo and it was absolutely impeccable from the start to the finish with full attention to details and quality of cuisine in addition to beautiful presentation of food the quality of french butter japanese seasalt french cheese selection as well as the selection of wines champagnes japanese premium whisky and digestives were the best i have ever experienced in the sky the teamwork of cabin attendants were also flawless not to be overpresent but always there discreetly as the seat cross the aisle was vacant cabin attendant prepared the bed there so that i can switch between work and rest with no hustle and timeloss i have been a fan of japan airlines but this was probably the best experience of all airlines so far,5
whats the one thing you want when you travel for business to get to your destination on time there is nothing that beats an uneventful flight and thats what you get with japan airlines my flights all of them boarded on time took off on time and landed either early or on time what more can you want on board the service is very good without being overly intrusive the food especially if you like japanese food is very good the selection is not as wide as some airlines but that doesnt matter on board entertainment was the only thing that could improve with a wider variety of western films,5
overall service was very good especially they were so generous with crystal yummy however the film selection was somewhat disappointing nothing interesting to watch dunkirk sorry i watched it on a emirates flight in december wonder woman watched it during my antarctica cruise again in december also it was rather hot and although cas kept saying that they would deal with it it was quite uncomfortable all the way to tokyo free wifi not easy even a ca was struggling still times better that ba,4
my wife and i flew business class from melbourne to tokyo the business class experience itself was only very average the seats were narrow and the service was surprisingly inattentive the flight left melbourne after midnight and we were tired after a long day and looking forward to some sleep on lie flat beds this was not to be there was a young couple on our row with an month old child which cried and howled the whole night long precluding any sleep i really cannot understand why people with very young children with a proclivity to howling choose to waste their money flying business class when they have no hope of having a pleasant flight and spoil it for all the other passengers who have paid high fees to fly business class,3
from the minute i stepped into the loungei enjoyed a level of care and comfort i hadnt experienced beforemight i point outi dont usually travel business classa friend gifted me the flightbut stillthe variety of food and drinks in the restaurant was mind blowing once i got into my cosy pod as i call iton the planei was in heaveni was so comfortablethe chair tilts to such anglesas to cradle my olderarthritic bonesbeing able to make it into a bed was wonderfulthe service by the hostesses was goodand when they noticed that i enjoy a plum winei kept finding sneaky refills on my traythe food was deliciousand so beautifully presented found the choice of filmsseriesetc was very wideand so up to the momentthe noise cancelling headphones were top of the rangeslept like a baby when the lights were dimmedthough the complimentary bag of goodies also had earplugs and eyeshades if neededtoilets were clean and nearby one last itemthe privacy screen between seatsanother good ideaespecially when travelling by oneselfat a press of a buttonone felt safe and secure,5
this was an aspirational trip using alaska airlines mileage plan miles in exchange for miles i received a first class ticket worth about what a bargain the trip was lovely but the cabin crew was far superior returning from japan compared with the crew enroutewhich is a shame as i slept a good part of the return journey service was attentive without being over the top i had read blogs of several frequent travelers who touted all the special attention they received extra pjs to take home fas insisting they try every menu item etc i believe they get all these extra services because they are somehow flagged in the reservations system because i got none of that however it was a great flight using miles but there is no way in heck it was worth anywhere close to in terms of service or amenities however personal space was exceptional,4
jal is rated as having one of the best premium economy cabins and we decided to splurge on a trip to hong kong before catching a cruise this class of service also allowed us to use the jal lounges in dfw and nrt to eat and drink while waiting for flights both flights dfwnrt and nrthkg were on the boeing dreamliner with seating we were on the side and the seats were comfortable with leg rests service was outstanding and entertainment system very good our only small negative comment the food as it was geared to the japanese tastes we would have preferred more western options however there were always snacks and we never went hungry will definitely look to book jal premium economy on future trips,4
what started out as a stateofthe art business class product is no longer competitive i flew this because of my one world emerald status but never again i usually go to jfk and from now on i would rather take aa to a gateway and change planes instead of taking the jal nonstop you walk onto the plane and it is like walking into a dingy and beatup rabbit warren cabins havent been updated in years the sky suites on the and the are claustrophobic at best window seats are cramped aisle seats are basically on the aisle and offer no privacy and if you are in a middle seat good luck food is good but the meal service itself was horrible on this flight the meal service took just short of hours from the time we took off until the time that the service ended and i was in the first row there were over m waits between courses i have experienced this type of service on previous flights one of the issues was that menus were not offered and orders not taken until about minutes after take off not like other airlines where this is done before takeoff there are only tiny lavs for pax not nearly enough amenities are geared towards smaller people there is one size of flight cardigan its a medium slippers also were undersized i wear a shoe not that big and the slippers were too small it was a problem as you needed them when you went into the lav i cant see how they can continue this level of service when competing with ana,3
the business class seats are at an angle and when they make a flat bed your legs go into a box in front and its very uncomfortable they also dont serve a welcome drink on this sector,3
as anticipated the cabin crew were very polite and efficient the legroom in pe was comfortable and the price was comparable with other airlines the seating is hardshell meaning the pax in front cannot recline into your space however the seat slides down and forward for sleeping placing you in an uncomfortable nearfetal position i have slept much better on other airlines spending over hours in flight to and from jfk meant that most of the decent screen entertainment had been exhausted before arrival back in sydney the food especially out of narita was quite ordinary jal is using young innovative chefs to create new dishes just what is burdock anyway at least the delicious japanese beer was freeflowing,3
it is always a good experience to fly with japan airline from the beginning of check in to in fly service everything is excellent the only area needed to be improved is the customer service telephone answering it took too long of waiting time to speak to a agent,4
飛行機を移動中の睡眠の場所と決めている私にとって例えトイレが汚くても日本食のコメが不味くてもシートが硬くフラットになる限り問題ありませんベッドとしての機能は問題ありませんregardless of notclean at toilet or notsatisfactory of cooking condition of rice quality of sleeping bed is more than satisfactory and i love jal,4
a great trip from sydney to tokyo plenty of space in premium economy friendly and efficient service from the staff on board food was fantastic and plenty of movies to choose from a relaxing flight that seemed to go by quite quickly,5
my flight from nrt to sin left late due to crosswinds at nrt the cabin was clean i was assigned a seat separate from my wife and couldnt change it to sit with her because the flight was fully booked the in flight service was average i still will fly with jal if it is the best fit for my time table,4
first impression was great as we were walking towards the economy checkin counter we were greeted like vips and have our luggage placed on the belt then we were shown where to go for a complimentary lounge access as premium economy passengers the food in the lounge was so so but the beverages were very good on the return flight the lounge at haneda was even better there i had a good shower as i was prepared with fresh underwear and sox but once on board we were a bit disappointed with the in flight service especially the breakfast on the return flight as well so fill up first and relax on board the headphones provided were above average and the movie selection have orsca winners the seating was very spacious with plenty of leg room most of all the slippers provided were most welcomed so make sure you can kick off your shoes no smelly feet please and relax,4
we had heard great things about jal so were excited about our upcoming trip we have visited japan times on different airlines but have to say air canada wins for the best service both the departing and returning jal flights were delayed by and hours respectively jals service on the plane was fine but the menu leaves something to be desired for the north american palate the food was well presented enough to eat for most women but very japanese cuisine with no western food alternatives offered they have a good selection of movies the plane was fairly late model with tinted windows rather than pull down shades and there was the average seat leg and elbow space the staff was friendly and accommodating but the japanese female flight attendants speak very meekly and quietly so we could not understand any of their instructions over the plane intercom on the flight to japan we sat in the boarding area minutes because they announced that the plane was not ready then we boarded and sat on the tarmac in the plane for over an hour because we departed so late the air controllers had to reschedule us into another flight slot on arriving in japan we descended and were a few hundred feet from touchdown when the pilots thrust the engines and we climbed steeply back into the sky and flew back out over the ocean for another minutes we were dismayed that a hour flight became closer to hours anyone can have an off day so were not expecting similar delays on our return flight the pilot then did speed up i suppose because even leaving an hour late he got us back on schedule however we have never encountered these problems when flying air canada our usual airline the flight prices were also almost a third more expensive than ac even though we booked months in advance however this could be because it was christmas season travel,3
we flew economy the flight attendants food and overall service was great the seats themselves were comfortable however the leg room was really limited and especially if you are in a isle seat with the metal box that is attached to the outer legs of the chairs i understand flying economy means you do have to give up some things but a place to put your legs should not be one of them on long flights it can be a serious health issue if you cant move your legs enough to keep from developing clots in your legs,4
wow tired of paying for every little thing yes then this airline is for you checked bags nc no charge two great on board meals nc beerwinewater nc blanketpillowheadphones nc entertainment nc great customer service nc i have never had a better experience on a flight and in economy class plenty of leg room,5
called to see if i can recover my jal reward points and waited minutes on the phone and talked for only minutes and hung up on me after saying my points can not be recovered with bad attitude this made me associated with my flight experience with jal flight attendant pushing food cart and hit my knee while i was sleeping it was so painful and she didnt even say sorry jal the worst airline i have ever experienced i will avoid this airline at all cost,1
was unable to secure exit row seats in economy so decided to give premium economy a go as i need the legroom pe customers do not get any priority boarding but they do get access to the jal lounge which is very nice was in seat k which is the first row behind the business class bulkhead so it has the most room of all the pe rows which meant i could get in and out without disturbing the passenger next to me all other rows had plent of leg room too but if the person next to you reclined you would probably have difficulty getting past them i say recline but in fact the seats moveslide forward rather than recline backwards so you do intrude on the space behind which i believe is a great way to go you get a small pack of stuff and basic noise cancelling headphones the only let down for me was that the meal options were the same as economy so they were average choices there were a couple of special alcoholic beverages in pe that were over what you could get in economy the in flight service was very good overall believe that jal pe is one of the best i have flown for the extra,4
even though i travel quite a bit this was my first flight on the boeing dreamliner i booked my flights except for incountry domestic indonesia through american who code shares with pacific cathay and jal for indonesia even though jal is a partner they would not let me get a reserved seat not to worrywhen i got to the jakarta airport early for my flight they gave me a nice window seat in the exit row their service is excellent including meals and liquid refreshments the japanese are extremely clean the flight attendants actually vacuumed up around their galley and the exit row area ive never seen that done on a flight they keep coming at you to ask if you need anything else they keep the toilets immaculate jal is an excellent airlinechoice the dreamliner pressurizes the cabin more like sea level atmosphere so you dont get the ear popping and you feel more relaxed after the flight each seat has its own inflight entertainment screensuite,5
in my previous review i shared my mixed feelings after experiencing problems with seat selection on my return trip from boston i experienced what another traveler went through waiting on the line for hour before it was picked up however the staff was polite and helpful she could not change my seat to be seated with hubby but she put a note in the system that i have motion sickness and would prefer to sit next to hubby i was advised to check in early at the airport the staff did arrange for me to sit beside hubby on both legs of the flight a specific flight crew was designated to look after me they would introduce themselves and check on me once in a while transiting at narita i exited the plane to find a ground staff holding a paper with my name and asking if i was ok so much attention levied but not at all intrusivefirst class service on board if not for the hassle about not being able to choose seats for n class tickets i would have chosen jal anytime,4
pleasantly surprised with excellent service onboard by their air stewardess spacious leg room for economy class meals were labelled clearly with the ingredients used in english requests attended to almost immediately it was all smiles by their cabin members didnt have to tolerate unpleasant feeling while onboard unlike with some other airlines that choose to serve you accordingly based on race or type of cabin class,5
for a domestic flight it had spacious seating even better than the international flights from qatar dublinosaka clean nice service even received a beverage for free will fly jal again,4
my trip from delhi to tokyo was very comfortable and hassle free everything was moving like a clockwork typical japanese efficiency with warm hospitality their collection of in flight entertainment was varied to suit all tastes food was excellent we were given second meal in advance before they stopped serving great experience,5
i was on my way home from tokyo to okayama the train takes only a little longer but i like to fly this was a night flight with little to see and most people around me were dosing jal does these short flights as well as anyone and better than ost discreet kindly service interferencefree boarding and deplaning a flight as smooth as the atmospheric conditions allow which is more than i can say about the airport experience at haneda this was as full of hassles as the flight was free of them too many people too many flights long walks through the airport buildings not fun good to board the plane and relax good to be with jal,5
jl jfk a nrt p was a with four class of service st business premium economy and economy service from the cabin attendants was superb would be nice if inflight service was half as good on us carriers food was ok cabin configuration was not the most modern seats were smaller lacked storage space laid out in older format with seats along window side but the inner seat does not have access to a window and until the screen is raised between the two seats there is lack of privacy lavatories are way too small,4
excellent flights both ways to and from melbourne food was fantastic especially from narita to melbourne toilets are always clean and i found there is more leg room on these flights the price was average but well worth it,5
we were really glad we upgraded to premium economy this was a great airline to fly customer service was excellent seats reclined and there was a foot rest very comfortable flight with caring flight attendants,5
one of the best economy services i have had the economy cabin was well designed seats were super wide and had lots of leg room yet the seats were still comfortable pillow and blanket provided and unlike most airlines the pillow had some support and worked really well on the lower back entertainment system was modern with lots of movie choices with usb seat power to charge your devices food service was good limited options just two choices but lots of extra perks such as actual cutlery a hot towel before dinner and lots of drink options very impressed with the service on board from staff and the aircraft itself would certainly travel again with japan airlines,5
one of the best crews i have come across great fun and super helpful could not have done more for us and the kids we had travelling with us food was excellent and the plane was very modern and spacious first time flying with jal but would definitely fly again,5
had to go to tokyo from osaka and was using jal all was so perfect like everything in japan it was a pleasure,5
better specify your preference in meal when you book they didnt have options for meal in my flight to tokyo they only offer beef rice while im eating beef however their kids meal is the best among all other airlines that i have taken with yummy food and attractive decoration in plane equipment is a bit old but the overall conditions of the plane is neat and tidy,4
ive never eaten good airline food who has but honestly jal where amazing soba noodles with truffle sauce and fried chicken egg fried rice really simple but really good and the best i have had on a flight by some distance,5
enjoyed my flight on jal the attendants were very friendly and helpful the premium economy seats were wide and spacious enough nice to be given a checkin baggage allowance of pcs each at max kg each the definite plus factor was that we were offered the use of a service lounge in changi airport that had a good choice of food and drinks,5
we knew we were in for some typical japanese hospitality as the ground crew bowed deeply in unison on the tarmac as the plane taxied from the skybridge our flight was uneventful leaving and arriving on time and the service was excellent the dreamliner is quiet the windows extra large and there is unusually good leg room for economy class however the seats are surprisingly very hard they lack sufficient padding and become quite uncomfortable on a long journey the food was adequate but nothing special but we were disappointed with the entertainment system which had plenty of choice but poor sound which made the movie soundtracks difficult to hear we were provided with the worlds tiniest blanket which barely covered a moderately sized male passenger no doubt the airline wishes to reduce weight but the blanket was simply inadequate,5
i have rarely experienced a problemfree flight but this was it left and arrived on time no hassles on boarding smooth flight regulation drink of complementary juice on the way with a smile a view of mt fuji pointed out by the pilot for those on the other side of the plane from myself no bump on landing suitcase rolled off the conveyor belt right on time great lunch with my daughter when i got downtown,5
excellent on time review of jal took a flight from seoul to tokyo on a hour flight aboard a boeing dreamliner the dreamliner plane made the journey very easy and felt great to fly in a better pressured plane ground crew very efficient and quick to board depart on time flight crew was very professional and kept the plane very clean throughout legroom was a bit shorter than the previous i flew in but not too bad food was great full meal and snackbeverage service choice of western or japanese style real utensils good attentive service and excellent ife entertainment screen arrived ahead of schedule which was very nice will definitely fly jal again,5
they were simply fantastic their compassion is simply great i have to return home personal matter and i expected them to charge me for change my flight they didnt and put me on their next flight home,5
hour flights are always a daunting prospect but jal made this flight bearable with their professional service good food and decent in flight entertainment check staff were very helpful and the crew on board were super friendly good leg room nice choice of movies and music pillows blankets and headsets provided i usually do not eat a thing during flights the food is usually inedible but was very happy with dinner snacks and breakfast well done jal,4
this was by far the best airline we have ever traveled the staff were all very friendly and the trip was truly the experience of a lifetime there was more than enough room in the area and the flight was a total comfort would definitely fly this airline again,5
jal operated this am flight from hong kong to narita with a b dreamliner equipped with the sky suite ii in business class prior to boarding i used the cathay wing first class lounge instead of the qantas business class lounge that is the jal designated lounge nothing wrong with the qantas lounge as i have used it before but wanted to try the wing for breakfast to compare there was a buffet with standard western breakfast items as well as chinese items such as dim sum and congee in addition there was an a la carte menu with western and chinese items i ordered the glutinous rice chicken which was ok but served in an odd manner with the lotus leaves covering cut open in a rectangular opening on top which made it difficult to get to the food at the edges service in the lounge was generally good and there was no wait for a table boarding at the gate was efficient with different frequent flyer groups separated for priority boarding so that jal diamondone world emerald members boarded first from a separate line right after those needing assistance the sky suite ii is a fully flat seat but when fully reclined it sinks very low to the ground and the space is very narrow so that lying on ones back there is not much room for broader shoulders or much movement nevertheless i did manage some good sleep in the flat bed after meal service there is a tray table under the video screen which when pulled out can be flipped open to a decent sized table there is also a slot under the screen that can fit electronics with an outlet nearby to charge up your phone or other electronic a new addition is a contoured foam cushion pictured which is quite comfortable as a seat back but less useful as a pillow as always service and food on jal was excellent a good short haul flight with a very comfortable seat and great food and service,4
the best airline ever all the flight attendants are so nice and kind they always smile and thats make me feel good the flight was so comfortable and clean recommend,5
check in staff were very polite and informative of where we should go after check in the sakura lounge has a very good selection the jal shell flat neo seat was perfectly fine not completely flat in flight service was very good from the meals to the very polite and respectful attentive flight attendants excellent experience,5
i visit southeast asia every three or four months and use one of the travel discount websites for the best price several times jal has had the best price and most convenient times they are a wonderful airline and the four or five times ive flown with them ive never been disappointed with any aspect of the flight theyre superb,5
very professional service crew from checkin counter to plane crew nice food and extra legroom really helps especially on long haul flight,5
wonderful first class loungevery attentive efficient and polite stuff in lounge at boarding and inflight very intelligent seats and very nice japanese inflight food service excellent inflight entertsinment system definitely one of the best sielines in the world,5
japan airlines jal world review for their website to reservebook air ticket this review is for booking an air ticket on their website it is usually recommended to buy the air ticket directly from the airline and i had a great experience with other aa united delta website before however with japan airline the website keeps showing tickets that are not available for booking or the seats are not available you keep seeing the ticket select it fill in the passengers information and then the website will pop the window say it could not find the fare you selected they should let the website hold the ticket the moment passenger choose the ticket and give time to fill info and pay say mins the funny part is when i am on phone with a customer agent for jl in usa the agent is seeing the ticket in their system seats left at the price for that flight at the same time i am trying to buy that ticket at the same time on my computer when she is on the other side of the phone the same error popped up and would not allow me to book that ticket japan airline really needs to fix and integrate their website better with their ticket system customer service is generally great inflight and through phone if you can wait minshr,3
very impressed with this airline nice food extremely friendly staff and more leg room than average both flights were on time and everything went very smoothly at haneda airport we were given complimentary access to the sakura lounge which was nice would recommend,4
i would have given them stars but lost one star because my breakfast had been overlooked after taking my order i eventually press the call button and enquired about my omelette breakfast but because the plane was about to land in hours it would be too late to have the omelette and had to pick one of the japanese dishes which was delivered promptly however i could not fault the service the care and efficiency of the staff the plane was immaculate and the restroom spotless that said i would have no hesitation to fly japan airline again,4
just before boarding i requested help from the jal staff i was carrying a year old baby and i was in pain from a bad bac the jal staff refused assistance and as i proceeded down the boarding ramp i collapsed with my child the jal staff stood there and watched they refused to help worse they loaded all passengers of the who had to step over me and my child to board it was only after all passengers had boarded before the crew came out to help me with a wheel chair the humiliation i suffered was nothing short of abuse i will never fly jal again never,1
ive been lucky enough to take this flight a number of times and i marvel at the schedule it leaves sydney at am and arrives in narita at pm its very reliable and these are sociable hours jal uses the qantas business and first lounges which are more than adequate and serve a decent breakfast beforehand i traveled with family including a toddler boarding is efficient with business and first having their own boarding line at the gate business passengers have skysuites which regularly win awards the configuration is but theres the added advantage of all window seat passengers having their own convenient entry hallway i do have a gripe after they turn the seatbelt signs off they start the lunch service which in my opinion is far too early by the time they serve drinks hand out menus and take orders lunch is served around am im convinced that its to fit in with the staffs break schedule because after this many of them disappear my second gripe is that over the years theyve hardly changed the menu there are choices western or japanese western is always appetisers followed by either western beef or some sort of fish dish japanese is a selection of appetizers then a japanese specialty whilst it is very well presented and in some cases colorful the format never changes the childrens meals were very unappealing and were left untouched theres a variety of snacks which they say can be served any time the service is gracious and respectful and in all instances every effort is made to help the standard of english varies from very good to adequate the beds are flat and you are supplied with a mattress and a thin quilt the pillows are a bit inadequate however its possible to get some reasonable sleep the passengerrestroom ratio is positive and theres rarely a need to wait theyre always spotless i always feel very safe on this flight and theyre a stickler for keeping to the schedule their business class fares are more than competitive when compared to other airlines i find them hard to beat all things considered it connects well with onward flights to europe and the us but also arrives at the perfect time for a hotel stopover at narita which i prefer to do however their attention to children is very poor there are no coloring books or amusements offered although there are some childrens movies apart from this the schedule safety procedures and value are good,4
extremely welcoming and kind flight staff both in terminal and on flight excellent food roomy seats spotless plane lots of amenities etc etc i could go on and on and this was economy jal please dont ever change,5
i have a bad back and wed still wanted to take our daughter to japan flights in out of haneys offered business class pods everything was super comfortable even for me seats fold entirely flat extra futon cushion is available privacy dividers slide up between pods food service was excellent everything was very clean and well designed plenty of space to put all your stuff gift bag just soso the lounge at haneda was pretty crummy we were totally surprised by the low quality accommodation and food but to feel great after an hour flight is really something special highly recommended if you can afford it we used a combo of miles and money,5
i enjoyed the flight with jal always unfortunately the japanese diner is not so great but i can take a rest in long flight,4
its true that you deserve to be among the best top airlines because of your outstanding services from check in to cabin crew services is good for someone to enjoy your flight some of the tips you gives us during the trip eg while across mount fuji is important for us view and enjoy our journey,5
we recently flew to south korea for the winter olympics and decided to use our miles on japan airlines for business class seats this might have been our most impressive flight in all of our travels from the states includes europe australia and new zealand all in business class first the staff was impeccable they were attentive friendly and regularly checked if we needed anything i realize we were in business class but from what i could tell the entire cabin was treated just as well the seats were plush and had a lot of space my only reservation is the fact that the chair does not lay completely flat not that you couldnt completely stretch out but i am weird and cant sleep well at a slightly angled position it feels as if i am sliding down the tv screens were easy to navigate and the selection of movies new and blockbuster was perfect if you decide to bring your own headphones make sure you have a double jack my one negative of the flight are the windows i like that you can greatly dim them into a deep blue to block the sun but we were on the side where the sun was directly hitting the window and even with the dim selection we were blinded while laying back there should still be an option to black them completely out with a shade finally the food was fantastic an american and japanese selection was available my palette was not advanced enough to try the eel or squid but the soups were amazing i highly recommend this airline,5
i had never flown on japan airlines before but had always heard great reviews on my last trip to india i flew china eastern needless to say i will never fly this airline again if i can avoid it because of the horrible experience from start to finish japan airlines was fantastic decent meals well organized and a crew that is truly interested in making your flight the best possible,5
flew jl flt seats hk returned jl flt seats hk we had the premium economy window aisle seats on the right side seats were roomy the service was very good close enough proximity to the bathroom without all the noise food was okay but they made up for it with lots of beverages soups various side dishes a large selection of free movies were available in various languages some with subtitles plus nice headphoneswe were also able to use the lounge at both airports which had an assortment of free food drink especially haneda,5
everything was wonderful about japan airlines especially the most gentle and wellmannered staff to the quality of the food served onboard clean seats clean toilets punctual flight and good range of latest movies,5
we cant speak highly enough about jal generally and their business class in particular from the moment we checked in at sydney airport till we walked out of the airport in narita we had an amazing time and a lovely experience the flight attendants were typically gentle beautiful japanese ladies yes only ladies in our section who smiled and made us feel that nothing was too much trouble quite different from some other airlines who will remain nameless where the attendants give the unmistakable impression that they really are above serving the lowly public and that they really dont want to be here not so with jal attendants the seats themselves were brilliant full lay back seats in their own quite substantial pods so much better than business class seating on some other airlines where the seats are just much bigger and more space this we felt was more like a st class experience although we havent traveled st class we can only imagine we chose the japanese menu and it was excellent food set out on a little table cloth with white linen sometimes a bento box and sometimes plated food complimentary french champagne was offered frequently along with glass refills plus other drinks of course the screen was very large and down the end of the pod so the whole experience was perfect sitting with legs stretched right out watching the screen eating lovely japanese food and drinking french champagne ahh bliss shame it is only a hour trip the toilets were clean and immaculate right to the end of the flight fresh flowers in the cubicles were a nice touch we had heard that jal is one of the best and we can agree and say that it was the best flight experience we have ever had the icing on the cake for glorious weeks in beautiful japan can you tell we are fans of japan,5
a very convenient flight that was dealt with pleasantly and efficiently food was ok addition of some western selections would help,5
my hubby and i had tickets bought at different times as he was flying on corporate account we could not check in until hrs before departure when we did try we were not allowed to change seats for the first leg of the flight after calling the customer service line the staff could not help either she was polite and apologetic she would put a note in the system to indicate we would like to be seated together she advised us to go to airport hrs before departure at get it done we did arrive at airport plus in the morning the checkin counter staff said she could not change and we would have to wait till another passenger check in upon which the staff would ask if he is agreeable we were told to find out at the departure gate since it is such a long flight we were a bit anxious not to know till boarding thankfully a passenger agreed to change seats the flight experience was good we now have to call again to request for seat change before our return flight i hope we wont have to do the same all over again in short the system was bad but the staff helped to make the experience a little easier to swallow,4
booked a flight then had to change schedule it is still within hour window so i thought it should be fine since ive done that with chase ultimate rewards and jal website says you can cancel within hours however i called customer service and i waited for hour still no one answered the phone longest wait in vain in my whole life guess thats their way to make it pass hours so you can not return,1
seats in the economy section are designed for japanese people thus someone my size not much off sumo is almost impossible though the flight was only hours i was in pain for most of my waking moments the passenger next to me was aware of my quandary and did not get in my space there just wasnt enough for those of us larger than an average carrier should always consider a western carrier kansai was a very efficient airport and staff was very pleasant,3
boeing aircrafts to and from narita international comfortable seating good selection of inflight entertainment efficient and friendly crew food is culture and if you claim you are an airline that respects other cultures the food choices and flavors should be taken care of despite jl has been flying to and from india since many decades their food was bland not filling and not satisfactory i gave feedback and a senior member of the crew was professional and kind enough to come and listen to me apologize and offer me a basket of snacks it helped a bit but the flavors were light years away from any indian palate over hours flight without yummy food is pretty much a torturer but rest of the experience ontime performance checkin landing luggage service etc was great,4
the food is beautiful the service excellent and in business class there is room to sleep we are frequent fliers and the japan air service is consistently better than the other airlines we fly,5
i have made the round trip tokyo kyoto tokyo both flights were astoundingly comfortable relaxing and stressfree even when i was slightly late the staff kept their cool and calmed me down it is hard to find flaws in their service i believe it is harder for them to think of ways how to improve their service which is impeccable,5
not a hitch not a problem my flight was smooth service impeccable on time efficient and almost a pleasure the automatic luggage check in machine in haneda was a trip in itself not quite a robot but it took charge of my luggage and issued a receipt without any human involvement haneda airport is a bit of a maze but i knew enough to allow time to get to my gate okayama much smaler made everything easier i barely slowed down between leaving my seat on the plane and boarding the bus for downtown,5
i fly a lot and on many airlines and really liked jal much more than most the plane was very clean the staff were friendly and helpful leg room is average the meals were very good and did not leave an after taste what really cought my eye were the staff continually cleaning restocking and organizing their areas i just wish they to more areas highly recommend,5
impeccable service beautifully presented meals plenty of leg room comfortable multiposition seats that lie flat mattress and pillows available personal monitors plenty of entertainment choice worked perfectly privacy screens between seats outlets to charge electronics i usually dont sleep well on planes slept like a baby on this flight a splurge that was worth every nickel especially for a hour flight,5
i cannot remember ever having the type of attention i received on this flight gentle attentive softly spoken and willing to make me as comfortable as good be and a small aside they have a bidet on the plane i loved it and they have two different menus one for japanese food and one for americaneuropean style food,5
we all know that flying from ny to tokyo is a long flight with that being said air japan was excellent all around the staff made sure that all was fine on a regular basis all of our needs were attended to and we never had to search out a staff member instead they were there to ask us what we required first good food for an airline comfy seats they even blocked out the middle seat of three seats so we had more room to relax,5
flying jal was clearly a better experience than flying with the three major us airlines and i have flown with all to asia the staff of jal provide excellent service and they do so with a genuine smile the customer truly feels they are appreciated by the staff and are responsive to any request the customer has this is the fourth time i have flown with jal and each experience has been consistent and worthy of my highest rating the i flew in was comfortable and i had sufficient leg room also the personal viewing screen worked flawlessly and the sound quality was very good the offerings of movies and tv shows were quite numerous now for the food the two meals we received were tasty and again much better than what i have received in the past from the major us airlines wine and beer were complimentary,5
flight left and arrived on time excellent service from take off to landing restrooms were clean flight crew did a great job,5
flights left and arrived on time plenty of leg room and nice wide seatsservice was good plenty of food really didnt eat all of every meal it would be nice if they were a little more english spoken since flying between two english speaking countriesthey would just show you picture and you had to pick less of the airline selling storeone landing was very ruff not sure if we had a new pilot overall i was happy with flight and would fly jal again,4
hospitality and service is one of the top in the business at every step of the way the service was exceptional from checkin inflight to leaving we also used our miles to upgrade us partway to business class if you are able to this is the way to fly longdistance attentive hospitable pe seats recline partially but with the foot rest it makes a world of a difference to aid support especially for those vertically challenged business seats of course recline all the way down giving you a good rest food was good as usual in between snacks even better d only negative is their max luggage weight is so much lower than other airlines flying the same route,5
good service and sufficient leg room in economy staff is attentive and provide drinks throughout the flight,4
our jal flights left and arrived on timethe seats were spacious even for economy class and service was excellent food was also quite goodi especially enjoyed the miso soup and the green tea our little niece even got a free toy their inflight entertainment system is easy to use and had all the latest movies i thoroughly enjoyed our hour flight and would highly recommend this airline,5
ive flew jal overseas from hawaii but this was and inter island flight in japan to get to another location typical japanese fashion everything is always prompt and orderly the staff was gracious and helpful a bit of a language barrier but yet you still can get around the flight was smooth and was able o get some undisturbed rest japanese flights to me seem so quite compared to us flights no crying babies or people talking loudly wonderful,4
aboard their i was expecting to have a roomy modern business class but instead the layout was normally i would have been disappointed i had just gotten off of the jal sinnrt flight and the s business class was a layout that featured weird seats in the center where the legs of the two center seat passengers overlap but at different heights making one person uncomfortably low and the other uncomfortably high cramped and claustrophobic so on the nrtsan flight i was looking forward to try something differentand found the seats to be quite comfortable for sleeping seated in the back row of the biz cabin was not a problem until mealtime when they ran out of entrees that my seat mate and i had ordered i pushed back at business class prices i expected to at least get the meal i wanted they made someone else change their mind which i felt bad about but why did they target us for the forced change the amenity kit was a bit lackluster but in general they are a waste so i didnt mind i wouldnt seek out jal for business class travel their product is not at the same level as cathay pacific or singapore airlines but the cabin crew were attentive when you needed something and quick to pickup finished trays,3
unlike previous flights on jal the business class attendants were a little more forthcoming with alcohol on this flight i know its a minor point especially with all the air rage incidents but they can look at my records and realize im a million miler on their partner seats were comfortable and angled flat business class was not filled to capacity so if youve chosen the wrong seat you should be able to change sadly these were old style seats in a configuration meaning that if you are travelling solo get one of the middle seats so no one is crawling over you to get to the bathroom,4
on time departure fuss free stewardesses speak more english now better than ever service is excellent always there to please passengers food is a lot better than previous years cristal roderer champagne several compartments for hand carry items and bags movies up to date additional comfortable mattress always welcome lovely clean comforter,5
flew roundtrip in economy between ny jfk and tokyo haneda on japan airlines jal boeing nonstop good flights economy is cramped as with nearly all airlines but service level is quite high flight attendants are well dressed very polite and always smiling they aim to please throughout the flight food is acceptable including meals and a snack with ice cream for dessert at the first meal definitely a step up from united or american,4
outstanding service peaceful flight most courteous and efficient service i have received on a flight in a long long time,5
i never fly to and from japan with any other airlines than this one its nonstop to and from san diego so you can avoid the hasslebustle at lax or sfo and of course youll never miss a connecting flight the service is superb and the food is excellent all my friends in japan use this flight now,5
one of the best flights i have experienced flight crew was very accomodating and made sure every part of the flight was comfortable kudos for customer service above and beyond,5
jals premium economy is pricey but worth it your luggage is tagged priority and you have lounge access air france lounge is okay with a very limited selection fruits cheese and crackers and cup of noodles beverage choices from white and red wines coffee juice and water if i may add the gentleman when you check in is by far a person without personality no greeting or smile came from him sakura lounge in narita is far better good selection of food and excellent service there are massage chairs that are very relaxing now the flight premium economy seats are very comfortable and theres at least a good inches of legroom space for a you dont bother the person behind you when you recline the seats would slide and you can release the leg rest and have a good comfortable flight food going to nrt was very good coming back it was okay the flight attendants are very attentive always with a smile on their face,5
nice flight comfortable seats kind staff clean toilets only one negative aspects food is terrible japanese style boxes meaning tiny servings and mainly salad you just eat salad bring some food from home,3
i am indebted to the japanese businessman traveling behind us in economy plus for knowing more about the electronics in the cabin and being able to explain them to me in perfect english than any of the flight crew whose english was lacking i wanted to read using my ipad without running out of battery and knew there had to be a way on our boeing jet to get that power the flight attendants were clueless the businessman told me the usb port would not work but that there was an electric plug near the floor on the barrier between seats and so there was and this businessman provided me instantly with the plugs id need although i did have all those converters and plugs in my carry on bag in the overhead bin the flight attendants also had no clue why my ipad was picking up a full five bar wifi signal throughout the flight japan airlines may have wifi with air to ground connectivity on certain parts of the flights but the attendants were unable to either explain it or knew nothing about it,3
business class on jal is definitely a step up from that offered on ua aa dl and ac however im not certain it was worth the premium price i paid the hard product minisuite was great especially if you have a window seat i slept better on this flight than any others in recent memory primarily due to the amount of privacy the large footwell and the complimentary foam pad i thought the food was just soso and the service was on par with what i have experienced on usbased carriers in a premium class i paid a premium to fly jal but i dont think i would do that again if i could find a jal flight within of us carriers i would pay that premium for the privacy and enhanced sleep experience,4
this was my first time flying solo especially internationally but jal was so helpful and worked with me to cultivate an enjoyable and smooth experience,4
after flying to indonesia on singapore airlines and cathay pacific we booked with jal from boston to jakarta through tokyo we were very happily surprised with the organization the beautiful boeing and the food and service the other two aforementioned airlines are also very good however the jal fare was a little cheaper and the premium economy seats were much better room wise and more comfortable plus there were only two flight segments to indonesia rather than or i highly recommend jal for flights from boston to asia or southeast asia,5
first class is not offered on this flight and the business class seemed to be only a slight level from regular class not worth of air miles typically when we fly business we are offered a glass of champagne before departure and a menu not on this flight they came around with a warm towel before food service and really that was all snacks were rice crackers in a typical snack bag on previous flights our snacks are on plates the group lounge in vancouver is horrible the food was awful and the only drinks they offered were beer we ended up eating before our flight the service on the flight was ok the flight attendants seemed irritated that we didnt understand the menu options the food was awful not one decent thing to eat we tried their japanese menu awful and then their western menu awful on the way to narita the baggage handler destroyed my daughters luggage they let us know our luggage would be bagged in plastic on arrival to japan we had to find the jal damaged luggage and even though this was inconvenient they were fantastic about replacing which is why i gave them stars whenever we fly long distance we fly business and this is by far the worst business class we have ever had the seats do not lay down like a bed the feet actually go under the seat in front very low so if you have swelling issues like i do you have to sit up the entire time so your feet arent at floor level,3
took the family to japan and wanted to use miles jal was a participant in the milage program we use we flew economy and expected very little as far as comfort and food goes we were all pleasantly surprised i am ft tall and thought the legroom more than adequate the food was nonfrills but good enough for my picky family the snack of a hagen das cup of ice cream was a real treat the attendants were all very friendly and eager to help boarding and exiting was straight forward and the entertainment system had all of us occupied as expected the only drawback for me was the seat itself for long hauls like this i would have liked something a bit more comfortable i am not talking about the size but shape and or the cushioning passengers are expected to be in their seats for extended periods of time and this seat left me sore by the time we landed,4
convenient connections in japan the service is good meals are decent compared to others but the temperature during flight is always an issue just about every flight i take i have to ask the cabin attendants to decrease the temperature checkin service at the terminals in japan seem extremely time consuming and lines tend to be long compared to the us operations dont know why so its good to give yourself some extra time to avoid the panic,4
we selected premium economy seats a and c bulkhead front row service was excellent seats were roomy with good layback plenty of room on the floor to throw stuff highly recommend jal off on time and arrived on time,5
very nice and friendly services to customers at checking in all flight attendants were also nice and provided good service as well i would recommended to flight with jal rather than others i love to fly with them again,5
the best customer service i ever hadasian hospitality is the bestwhat a different culturethe staff is so friendly,5
we traveled coach and were still relatively comfortable there was sufficient leg room the entertainment was varied and there was lots of it to last the hour flight three and hour flight back bathrooms were clean throughout the trip pillows blankets tooth brushes meals all good and one was really tasty free wine etc made a very long rip in coach very pleasantthe flight attendants are polite and solicitous they dont simply disappear you can carry on two bags and check two bags for free in other wrds once you pay for your ticket they dont nickel and dime you another great thing i thoe majority of the customers are japanese so the flight is quiet no drama and everyone is polite how wonderful on a very long flight i love jal,5
i was flying in economy but the service made me feel like it was first class the flight attendants are the best makes a long flight more tolerable,5
the departure lounge is lufthansa based its nice but nothing spectacular the service on board is impeccable the food was delicious and varied unfortunatelyi found the bed uncomfortable and difficult to sleep in on a hour flight thats rough,4
despite the fact that two hours into our hour flight we had to turn back to lax sit on the tarmac for several hours while the problem with the plane was fixed i was highly satisfied with the service we were updated frequently on the status of the flight and arriving at narita we were put on buses at no expense to us to tokyo station and other places then after submitting additional transportation expense receipts we were later reimbursed for that the return flight had no surprises and the flight attendants were just as thoughtful and efficient,5
booked through ba who neglected to tell us that with jal you can check in hours in advance so by the time we checkedin there were only single seats available explained this at the gate and a member of the jal team took us on to the plane and negotiated with other passengers and got us seated together we were so impressed not only was she incredibly helpful and efficient but she negotiated in english japanese and french,5
i booked this flight using alaska airline miles and initially booked a business class seat but a week later i was able to locate availability for first class seats checkin at jfk terminal was a breeze and it took maybe minutes in the dedicated first class line since jal does not participate in tsa precheck we used the standard tsa line and that process took way longer than it needed to because tsa doesnt know how to get their act together luckily for us jal added the lufthansa senator lounge at jfk as of january so we were lucky to get to use this lounge instead of the air france one still available and you can switch between both the lounge was nice and the views of the runway were great for making the time pass by we left the lounge minutes before boarding and had no problem boarding with the priority section of travelers the jal first class cabin is really nice and with only suites it feels both spacious and private everyone we interacted with during our hour flight was super friendly and i greatly enjoyed myself the food was incredible and i would recommend that you try the japanese menu as everything was so yummy my single complain about this flight was the temperature at which the cabin was kept i tried falling asleep but couldnt very well because the cabin felt so hot for the entire flight the seat is very spacious and when youre ready to sleep a mattress pad and pjs are provided along with a heavier blanket you are unlikely to need it since its so hot on the plane overall i look forward to earning more alaska miles to redeem them for another chance to fly on jal first,5
this service is a cut above the rest the flight crew were incredibly attentive and the cabin was incredibly calm its quite a way to feel as though youre in japan well before you arrive ive flown other asian carriers and id say one of the real perks here is the experienced cabin crew those on other carriers are ok but many of these flight attendants have been doing this for years which means they know service and omotenashi look it up you wont regret springing for this,5
travel in a dreamliner and experience amazing staff and a throwback to when flying was a big part of the thirill and overall experience we simply loved this airline their staff and the larger seats in economy made it all so memorable,5
i always enjoy dying jal first class but this particular flight was the best of them all i had the entire front cabin to myself which included three jal stewardess the service is usually a bit robotic but this time the staff was energetic and full of personality they were proactive in anything i might have wanted and offered extra caviar i had them dancing in the galley to american music and just had an overall great time with them the bed is always wide and comfortable and the food was excellent i do miss have salon as the champagne i look forward to the next trip with jal,5
the most courteous flight attendants that i have ever had on any flight the uniforms were very neat and they all wore the same uniform on board they bowed each time when they were giving the safety talk very attentive and accommodating,5
i flew from boston to thailand on jal business class it it was such an incredible experience compared to my return on aa in first class,5
i flew flight aa and japan airlines from narita to bangkok it was around a hour flight and the seat i had was a coach aisle seat and there was very little room for my legs i was in seat h and the plane was a the flight attendants were great but the seat room left a lot to be desired the food on japan air was excellent the flight was super except for the abbreviated room to stretch out on,4
flew japan airlines boeing b from jfk to tokyo narita boarding was on time and orderly the aircraft looked like it was only a few month old from boeing factory cabin crews are super friendly and courteous quality of in flight meals and snacks were also pretty decent they ran water and juice service literally every mins throughout the entire flight arrival in tokyo was on time and really enjoyed this long haul flight with japan airlines,5
after a trip to japan in with japan airlines we were just as happy to fly with them again this year the staff are very attentive and helpful and the food and drink service was very good not sure if its standard size but there seemed to be plenty of leg room staff were always around even during the night offering a snack when you went to the bathroom which was kept very clean and regularly walking through offering water would be very happy to fly jal again,5
i chose a nonstop jal flight for our family trip despite the increased pricemy families prior flights on jal had been fine dinner was not served until i was falling asleep and i declined it only an asian breakfast that i could not eat was available,3
wow i never thought flying could be this comfortable hour flight from boston to tokyo was a breeze we also had access to the airport lounge which had great food snacks and drinks seats in premium economy were comfortable and spacious staff was very friendly and helpful service was fast and the meals were good highly recommended i will be using japan airlines again,5
we had seats in premium economy that were not adjacent so we asked the woman at checkin if it would be possible to switch with someone she typed for entirely too long an then very apologetically said that premium economy was overbooked and asked if we would be okay flying in business class she was so apologetic that my wife thought we were being downgraded after hours in business class with lieflat seats in a brand new dreamliner snacking on wagyu my wife suggested that we just keep going to europe not the typical sentiment after a long flight aside from the upgrade it was a great flight,5
the staff were very friendly we asked if we could seat together as there were and they accommodated us well with plenty of leg room and seats were great and comfy and the food was hot and tasty would not hesitate to fly with them again even if the price to fly was a bit high but well worth the money,4
we have flown with jal many times the service has always been stellar the employees on the ground and in the air have always been wonderful however this trip was horrible and unscrupulous we connected in chicago and were on our way to narita international airport in tokyo once we would land we knew we had a hour and minute layover surely that would be enough to land taxi to the gate deplane go through immigration get to the next terminal for departure go through security and check in to the departure gate when we landed a jal employee met us at the airplane door and asked if we were going to fukuoka we said yes and she said simply late we didnt know what she meant upon arriving at the jal connecting gate for fukuoka we were told that the flight had already departed we were minutes early but for some unexplained reason they said we were late since we were totally exhausted from the hour flight we were in shock we started asking why what to do where to get info for next flight why our flight had departed earlyetc we were shocked that few people spoke fluent english over the next minutes to an hour we were sent from place to place within the airport finally i almost fainted from overheating and exhaustion my wife was standing in yet another jal line trying to get information the line was extremely long i shouted to her that i needed to get somewhere to lay down or i would faint jal was of no help whatsoever no one inside narita could speak english well enough to see that we were in extreme distress nor could they direct us to help we ended up taking a chance and boarding a bus that was for the crown plaza hotel the police did not help us the taxi drivers were useless only this bus driver would help we were taken to this hotel where we told the manager of our problems and they accommodated us with superb compassion we called the ana airlines and made new reservations to continue to our final destination two days later at our new hotel we called our booking agent american express to tell her of our plight they called jal to reconfirm our original plans and tickets jal told amex that since we did not report our missed flight connection to the right party our tickets home were invalidated further to get home jal wanted us to pay for one way tickets back to the us in other words our tickets which we had paid for months prior were now invalid and it would cost us more to get home they told us this at am we were totally incensed and outraged we argued for two hours with jal who refused to change their position they said it was our fault my wife was on the verge of a nervous breakdown i was about to have my fourth heart attack our amex representative decided to get the jal rep to get her supervisor on the phone our amex rep told us she would handle it and would call us back two hours passed and at am she called us back she was able to get our tickets revalidated and get us back on track can you imagine how infuriated we were with jal they would have left us stranded in japan unless we paid them an additional they told us to read the fine print on our contracts we will never use them again we will never use them for our company business trips again either what a disgrace to do business in such a fashion we are consulting our attorneys,1
i always enjoys jal flights comfortable seats good films and fantastic food plus they generally carry or very good daiginsho sake one caution were flying blue klm members we thought wed be earning level miles with jal but you only get milespoints nothing towards your level,5
fabulous service from check in to landing clean comfortable seats excellent entertainment selection so refreshing to have such polite well presented staff on an airplane,5
jal economy beats the comfort and service of deltaaa and ual upgrade class any day the seats have what used to be called normal leg room before the cram more rows in craze service is what one would expect in first class politeness is standard highly recommend them,5
much superior to jal which was from sfo to haneda to be honest the japanese meal to japan was mediocre to poor whereas the food prepared at narita was simply outstanding one of the better meals i had in some time and easily the single best airline meal i have ever had in well over a million miles flown in all classes from st on lufthansa to ryan air in europe fine service from start to finish,5
i was in awe of the number of attendants and the great service they provided always coming by seat with drinks of varying kinds ie kiwi juice plus all the normal juices coffee pots were brewing fresh coffee and being served constantly meals were much better than us airlinesattendants were friendly kind they made a hr flight go by rapidly i hope management will read this and compliment the ladies that were on this flight seats were larger with ample leg room boarding onoff were both organized and accomplished wo difficultyplane was clean and organized i am trying to determine why the us airlines have not gotten the msg i have a lot of advantage miles with aa and never got this service and i am seriously considering moving to another airline i will fly jal when they service my area of travel when ever possible very impressed,5
our first time with jal to from tokyo for business class we thought the level of service was below par when compared to emirates or air new zealand on our outward bound flight they could not tuck us up soon enough and service was minimal on the return had to go for the rd main course option as they had runout while the staff are pleasant and courteous enough the environs are very bland,3
i have great impression with jal during my first japan trip their cabin crew shows politeness and deserved various food and beverage on flight you will receive blanket pillow and headphones for your entertainment service i would like to fly with jal again for another japan trip,5
loved the dinner dessert free alcohol drinkssnacks a variety of new movies plenty of leg room,5
having flown with japan airlines before and remembering earlier flights i was disappointed with this particular flight experience the service as always was excellent but the aircraft a boeing looked old and tired the interior was drab compared to the american airlines that i flew from the us to tokyo the flight was on time and comfortable but for an almost hour flight entertainment options were limited,3
staff is very friendly and supportive meals was tasty space between sets was very comfortable but when we returned on march it was newer plane and it was not so comfortable as an old one especially spas between sets was very narrow,4
love flying jal the service is always impeccable and the food and drinks are excellent the lounge at the airport is also very nice and comfortable,5
the food was better than other airlines but the hospitality of the flight crew was superb very attentive and always on a lookout to see if you need something it was a very long flight but the crew made everyone at ease,4
super efficient boarding is organized flights right on time airline attendants some of the most friendly and helpful you will ever encounter jal was flying an upgraded plane with more comfortable seats tinted windows and other amenities food was the best i have ever encountered on an airline why cant us based airlines figure this out,5
i have to say i have fallen in love with jals business class the service is calm serene and efficient and the chairs were spotless and condusive for good sleeping the food was a standout i had the japanese selections with matching saki and it was like eating in a fine japanese restaurant the flight attendant spoke of the history of the particular place the saki i was drinking was from which was delightful the ammenities kit was one of the best ive recieved in business class and i loved the slippers this is such a great idea you dont have to put your shoes back on to wander around the plane and you can simply leave the slippers on board if you choose i am now taking these kinds of slippers on board all long haul flights i arrived refreshed and ready to go which is what you want from business class i will definately fly jal again,5
i flew on jl domestic economy from hnd to ita in february hnd is the main domestic airport in tokyo and its a lot closer than nrt from downtown tokyo shuttle bus and train options are available from downtown or you may take taxi less than one way from the most of the hotels in downtown at hnd airport jl has a separate security line for elite members and my emerald status qualified for it almost no one in the line and it was very quick to go through the security used jl domestic business lounge prior to boarding fooddrink options for early in the morning am were limited so if you plan to have breakfast in the lounge you may want to consider a plan b coffee was very good and many power outlets for laptop be sure to bring japanese power outlet adopter flight was short about one hour and comfortable on b jl offers a discounted fare if you buy at least a few days prior to departure on board free wifi was also available to keep working for the duration or to upload to sns if youd like departurearrival were both on time check in at kiosk boarding at gate were both smooth ca offered blankets before departure a few beverage options in flight despite the short flight duration overall a great experience,5
with most japanese products and design their is attention to detail and polite and efficient service i found all of the above on my flight to tokyo haneda airport from singapore the flight is around six hours so its not overly long but it was a red eye flight so its never easy trying to sleep but not long enough to be uncomfortable for too long the seats were comfortable and i found adequate leg room the inflight service was modern and up to date so it was easy to use and the content was good the food was light and simple and surprisingly tasty consisting of a starter some noodles and a yoghurt overall i had a pleasant flight although it wasnt of the highest quality it was adequate and reasonably priced so in my opinion value for money,3
this was my first time on japan airlines i got a very good deal on a flight rt from nyc to singapore with a layover in tokyo it was my first time to asia too and having inch leg room really helped in flying for hours for flights i took with japan airlines i love that the flight attendants cared about my food restrictions they gave me a ticket for each meal and asked questions they never made me feel bad for having medical food restrictions i love that i got a pillow a blanket even in economy they had good films selection and i listened to u and other music through both of the hour flights this was the best economy which is the only class of ticket i can afford i have ever been on i was treated and respected unlike certain airlines here in the us where i have felt and been treated like cattle wish i could take japan airlines again i know they are in the oneworld alliance,4
i flew jl from sfo to hnd in january prior to boarding i used ba first class lounge it was an okay lounge but nothing special with limited food option i may try jl lounge at sfo next time sfo is a bit tricky airport i flew from sea to sfo to catch jl due to the fog in the morning my flight from sea got cancelled and as rerouted us to oak then shuttled in to sfo its a good thing that i had over four hours to make the connection i only had about minutes before boarding jl at sfo the aircraft was b as always seat was comfortable tv screen was large headphone sounded clear amenities were good jl provided really thick mattress that made sleeping even more comfortable i got extra blanket without any issue jl supplied a light jacket to wear during the flight instead of pajamas that was no problem as i dressed casualcomfortable for the flight meal was very tasty and i was able to eat whenever i wanted up to hours before arrival overall imho one of the best business classes,5
straight to the point there were only things that made it not as enjoyable as it can be first is the luggage weight theres of us so that means were allowed suitcases of kilos each we only had luggage but was kilos others were k and k even when were way under the limit they made us move the items around the luggage to make the kilos on the heavier one its a hassle when your in the check in counter and opening your luggage in the open secondly the flight we had has a special red menu which means your only choice or starve its a dinner flight and just over hours so yeah food is good unfortunately the shrimp curry main dish jello like dessert spicy potato salad just didnt blend right the butter pecan br ice cream helped but not as much the flight going to narita had excellent food and taste hopefully not all red menus will be like this,4
good flight checkin very professional haneda is a charm in flight good comfort excellent service however no meal choices even when seating in front of the economy class wife cannot eat certain food which meant going hungry until hk,4
jal offered great food and services on this hour flight the facilities were squeaky clean and the food offered was both healthful and more than adequate they were on time and offered a geat value for what was offered,5
i am highly satisfied flying with jal from osakalas angelesosaka flight for its fleet service cleanliness enough space for leg rest entertainment and delicious foods want to fly again with it,5
very good service very good staff good food very pleasant travel booked for special food special care,5
i recently travelled on japan airlines premium economy class to the united kingdom this is the first time i have travelled on jal i have to say i was very pleasantly surprised the seat i had in their premium economy cabin was very comfortable indeed the pitch of the seat was inches compared to other asian airlines premium economy seats which for the most part have a seat pitch of inches those few extra inches jal provide make a big difference when it comes to stretching out and sleeping jals premium economy class passengers have a separate cabin as well however unlike other airlines which have the same class of travel jal do not allow their premium economy passengers the use of their lounges anywhere not even at a cost that i would say was the only disappointment in my journey as i had been told whilst checking in at melbourne that i would have use of their lounge in tokyo whilst in transit that does help on long haul flights when one has a few hours to wait for the next flight however it was the service of the staff on board all my jal flights who went out of their way to make a very long flight as comfortable as possible,4
good seats decent service albeit the announcements were difficult to hear in english meals were slightly bad hard to eat them especially compared to ana where the food were excellent,4
newer touch screen entertainment better food slightly more leg room and good service if not better service plus lower fare jal poses a strong challenge to the aging sq with deteriorating quality,5
i had a great flight with jal last week in premium economy the seats were comfortable and the service was attentive ive flown their business class previously and got pe seats for a decent price at the last minute i was not disappointed,5
this airline carrier is exquisite and features great on board meal service drink service and the entertainment is great they provide excellent service with exceptional leg room this airline is truly above most others and comes with outstanding crew members,5
i flew jal many times international and domestic flights the latest was last february clean good food and good in flight service lounges are good too with nice variety of food and drinks they deal well with short delays butbut is there is a weather related cancellation they are the worst airline dealing with it i was about to start my second trip to japan this year when the fourth noreaster of march landed and jal sent an email hours before the flight telling us our flight was canceled giving us a phone number to call after more than three hours being on hold with no answer we try calling with different phones four of them and always on hold until pm eastern time when they closed their office in california leaving us without an answer calling directly the japanese office they werent much help either at least they answered the phone and all that was offered was a two stops flight more than hours next tuesday all other airlines flying the same plane rebooked their passengers jal got us grounded and being unable to have the dreamed vacation and the impossibility to cancel hotels before they became nonrefundable wonderful airline when everything goes as it should be but if there are cancellation due to bad weather or any other problem good luck we are still waiting for a notice of refund when hotelscom already credited our credit card for the hotels we were able to cancel,3
i have found there to be nothing special for their relatively expensive economy and business class service after all the good things i had heard i was quite disappointed i was able to find a flight with first class this week what a difference large comfortable leather seats same excellent service but this time with something behind it they served a typical japanese breakfast and even had a wine list to go with it the food was very delicious and beautiful first time on a plane all the fruit was actually perfectly ripe too they have free wifi but no other entertainment but that is just fine they offer slippers and also have a charging batter for usb port items purchasing first also allows use of the first class lounge which is well appointed and comfortable and has some nice food and drink selections,5
flight from singapore to haneda and haneda to obihiro domestic airport is very smooth not having to rush leg space was surprising out of my expectation which enable me to stretch my leg fully the crew is helpful and friendly and having japanese meal on board is a good thing for easy digestion especially for overnight flight i would recommend anyone who has the intention to visit japan to fly with jal i will not hesitate to fly with jal again in the near future,5
by far the best economy experience ever jals sky wider economy seat was arated and award winning and after my flight i can see why seat was an inch or two away from the premium economy offering of another airline and the entertainment center was very complete for coach service was impeccable and food selection was great beverage service was consistent from pre meal alcohol to post meal coffee or ocha definitely worth the extra coin,5
this was my first experience on japan airlines and it was a good one the airplane was a new and so comfortable even in coach it was not full so i was able to move and have two seats which helped of course on such a long flight the service was excellent and kind and of course we were on time or early i will fly this airline as much as possible in the future,5
were glad we flew with jal this time to osaka the flight left on time at h and arrived minutes ahead of the arrival time at kix the boarding was smooth and efficient the best part was the courteous service even the way flight attendants asked some passengers to switched off their cell phones before the plane did a takeoff it was one of the best flights,5
easy check in with priority through immigration lounge experience was fantastic great food beverage very good lounge comfort lot of charging for devices boarding was a short walk from lounge to gate boarding was easy hot towel drink on seating after take off another drink meal service i had the japanese set it was absolutely delicious with some bubbles heaps of entertainment to keep you occupied the seats were very comfortable i would fly jal anytime to anywhere the whole experience was exceptional,5
i thought the seat configuration is good because it is more seater for couple and if you are a family you can have be together too one thing good about japanese airlines is the japanese meal they offered they are pretty and tasty for us the crew is also friendly and helpful i do not mind flying with jal again,4
the title of this review is something of a serious question would it be possible just to live on a japan airlines jal flight i can say very definitively that i thoroughly enjoyed my hour flight from jfk to narita and the subsequent hour flight from narita to changi in singapore i was actually looking forward to the return flights and i was in economy the flight attendants were the most attentive and courteous ive ever had the pleasure of meeting its silly of me to have liked this so much but it was also completely thrilling that they all bowed to the travellers at the start of the flight you are almost constantly offered food and drink and really good food and drink the maindinner meals i was offered were tasty nutritious and filling snacks and drinks came at perfect intervals and if you feel peckish in between meals and snacks theres an area where you can pick up a snack on your own for me the seats were very comfortable and the entertainment offerings varied for example theres digital manga available and satisfying it does help if you understand a little japanese but almost all flight attendants know some english because i generally travel budget airlines im pretty happy if i get offered a pillow and blanket at no cost which jal did as well when ive travelled on nonbudget flights ive always been made aware that i was travelling in economy but not with jal the excellent treatment jal offered was above and beyond what i have ever experienced on any flight and i look forward to travelling with them again,5
all the airline staff are so professional from their service all the way to how they dress which is very classic the flight itself is extremely long but the airline does a great job of breaking it up between meal service total to drink service numerous there is individual inflight entertainment with a ton of movies televisions shows and music what could have been a long and boring trip turned out to be very nice,5
japan air is by far the best airline on the face of the planet the customer service is extraordinary in every sense you will feel taken care of like you matter like youre someone of value and importance and will be delighted the food was excellent the service unparalleled and the amenities were fantastic cant wait to fly with them again,5
this is the second time i flew with jal from europe to tokyo first chosen simply on timetable and price second i was explicitly looking to fly with jal the food on the second flight was not excellent as on the st flight but it was ok above average legroom and above average service simply japanese that says it all,5
flew jal due to cosharing with malaysia airlines mas despite being in an economy class the seat was comfortable dont mind the long journey the flight attendances were also helpful and very hospitable food was also good had rice with shrimp curry and it was awesome lucky for me since i cant take chicken or meat due to religious reason they serve hagendaz icecream for the desert cool,4
japan airline omg other airlines have a look and take a bow more seat spaceim talking economy class the passenger in front of you does not have his head on your lap one of the toilets are big i mean double the size of other airlines no kidding its clean and the attendants even made sure you have toothbrush to use when you wake up taps are automatic there are even the water spouts as in other normal japanese toilets its really a breath of fresh air for us poor economy folks they care about their passengersnot maximizing profits the flight is full thoughwords must get around a big congrats you bring some sense to air travel the flight attendants are polite and does not look like master herdsman controlling his cattle a bit of advicecoffee should be on the breakfast cart but the attendant was willing to run back to the kitchen to get it just for youwith a smile wifi is available but too expensive to usecharges hourly rates,5
very pleasant return flights to haneda from london during the daytime flight the crew regularly pass through the cabin with icedhot green teacoffee and hot facecloths along with the regular snacks and meals for dinner i had the chicken and potato gratin which came with a small salad a side dish of dressed noodles fruit salad a bread roll pickles and deli meat and a yoghurt with ice cream for dessert for breakfast i had the cheese and ham omelette which also came with a selection of little side dishes because our return flight was at night instead of serving dinner on the flight we were granted access to the jal sky lounge where we were able to eat from the buffet before boarding im guessing this was to allow passengers to try and sleep undisturbed for as long as possible the cabin crew were terrific at one point i felt slightly travel sick and the air hostess attending me made sure i was as comfortable as possible and checked in on me to see how i was doing,5
this is the second time i have flown jal i fly all the time and this airlines stands out they have excellent service and the flight attendants are great well done,5
the flight was in one of their latest dreamliners with suite style business class seats which provides good deal of privacy great service from professional and friendly staff good selection of entertainment and food and drink choices,5
i need to call japan airlines to rebooked my ticket i need to wait for more than an hour before i spoked to an agent it happened times the last time i called i was asking for the confirmation of my reservation as i cant checked my reservation online and the agent i spoked with is a rude guy he was mad and almost screaming on the phone what a bad customer service they have i hope jal will make something on this issue my flight was okay though only had a bad experience on their customer service,1
this was just one of the legs of my journey to south east asia but it was the best one i was early for my flight so i had time to ask for a free upgrade but no such luck how ever they moved me to the emergency exit at the bulkhead massive leg room plus the view was really nice on to the food ive always liked japanese food but what ive had in the states was cra p compared to this airlines food and the amount was amazing plus in a hour flight they fed us four times with miso soup at every course soooo goood you cant get people to act and be respectful on a flight it just wont happen and yes im talking about westerners so other than that best flight of the trip,4
havent use jal for almost years their services to passengers are still excellent with good courtesy food are not as good as before and with less choices but they are keeping their metal utensils rather than providing the passengers with plastic knives and spoons clean blankets and pillows had been offered to each passengers legroom and seats are widen than others asian airlines therefore it would be very comfortable for long haul flights although jals tickets are a little higher than other japanese airlines but i think they are worth in these the entertainment centre has a wide selection of movies too but most important their flights always leave on time and touch down punctually,4
with jal its very obviously all about their passengers the organization and each individual team member are very obviously focused on their passengers and that makes all the difference in any flight their equipment is well maintained extremely clean and to my experience they operate on time that said its about the team at jal they pay attention to you as an individual passenger looking to meet your expectations and anticipating your needs if you fly frequently you know what the inside of a or a or a or an a is going to feel like what makes any flight comfortable even enjoyable is the flight crews ability to meet needs jal has this down to a science when you an fly them,5
its just perfect from the brand new to the sky suite iii seat with extra width and pitch the screen the food the servicejust perfect there is just design error i spotted that is the switch for the reading light and service call is on the led screen itself very often passengers will accidentally press it it happens very often in the flight and more thing is the temperature in the plane is a little warm and i am just wearing summer shirt there is no individual vent for each seat other then these design flaws its just perfect singaopre airlines now has a very strong competitor,5
was pleasantly surprised by the generous leg room for my first ever jal flight jl from singapore to narita the entertainment console was also big and nice with touch screen capability movies selection was pretty good and recent the music selection was a little bit below expectation though food amd drinks were pretty decent and acceptable,4
this plane had the most legroom for a standard economy seat of any plane we have ever been on also had really comfortable seats with lots of cool well thought out features such as little cubbies for glasses phone etc excellent service good food and extremely clean throughout the flight if it werent for the screaming kids it would have been one of the best flights ever,5
travelling to sydney via tokyo on the way back from canada was a great move the aircraft leaves after lunch and arrives in tokyo late afternoon for a early evening connection to sydney this allowed me to stay awake until the overnight flight to sydney so i arrived early morning after a good sleep made the jet lag almost none existent the aircraft are both s although the canada sectors looked like an older interior with shell seats compared to the sydney sectors which were enclosed i must say though the enclosed seats felt somewhat cosier than the flat shell seats from vancouver jal service was very good nothing was too much trouble and the meal selections were great i also like the service starting not too long after take off as it allows you to get the meals out of the way in case you need to work my only issue the the repeated announcements after take off they can be annoying when you have just started a movie,4
excellent service excellent food and great attentionplane and restroomnvery clean business class is the way to go,5
on arrival at the airport the notice boards were saying that because of heavy snow my flight along with others to other parts of japan may be canceled or diverted back to tokyo we did take off in a very new plane which was comfortable and roomy but the pilot did warn to expect rough weather and a possible return to tokyo the rough weather did not eventuate service was polite and efficient and the pilot showed great skill in landing our plane during heavy snow on a runway that was white,4
my flight was from seoul to memanbetsu in hokkaido japan and i changed flight at haneda airport flight was excellent with good service and on schedule from seoul to haneda the aircraft was b which was comfortable its service was nice and want to travel with jal again tokyo haneda airport is very convenient for transit travelers from intl to domestic flight also can easily access to central tokyo thru mororail,5
remember the first time you learned how to respond to the greeting how are you and how selfconscious you were answering i am fine thank you well thats how the jal local ground crew did their obligatory bowandgreet as they opened the checkin counters selfconscioulsy but that was the only selfconscious episode during the whole jal flight from manila to jfk because everything else was done smoothly and efficiently and with an eye to real passenger service the checkin counters readily accomodated my request for an aisle seat their online checkin was not working that day and even gave us the seat with the biggest legroom at no cost i could only guess that maybe the long life expectancy common to japanese made their society more caring to their elderly and attentive to their needs the english language skills of the cabin crew are passable and one can request and get the usual amenities for a long flight of course the filipino cabin crews in pal can engage in better small talk and can even give you tips on getting around metro manila with their greater english proficiency but i digress what was a pleasant surprise to us however was the quality of the food although i readily confess they had me at haagen dazs ice cream standard dessert even in economy the appetizer and the mains were no slouch either they were tasty or as foodie blogs always say the flavors of their offerings are like a party in the palate i finished everything maybe i am really just a man of simple tastes that a simple serving of haagen dazs vanilla ice cream was enough to leave me wondering if this is just economy class i wonder what first class has on offer the layover was five hours in narita airport more than enough time to walk around the shops and have a snack or a drink at the good restaurants all over souvenir shops include wine stores selling the now trending japanese singlemalts and candy stores selling kit kats in various flavors found only in japan by and large flying with jal was a thoroughly pleasant experience and it starts with that selfconscious bow by the nonjapanese checkin staff,5
my outbound flight encountered a h delay after we had already boarded as can sometimes happen during this time we were updated every minutes as to the nature status and eta of the solution in both english and japanese and were offered refreshments throughout the process the professionalism of the staff during this time meant that nobody had any issue taking it all completely in their stride partway through the flight the head of the cabin crew went to literally every single one of the hundreds of passengers on the flight and with a gracious smile offered her personal and sincere apology again in both english and japanese and asked if there was anything they could do to make the flight more comfortable truly above and beyond the food was also excellent i had never tried tokyo soup stock before but i wish i had while i was still in japan this soup was served inflight and it blew my mind shattering my preconceptions about what is possible in airline food i will absolutely fly jal when i return to japan thank you for an unforgettable experience,5
i am a special needs traveller and jal pays high attention to make your travel comfortable they arranged for preseating as well as tagged my baggage as priority traveller service onboard was exceptional this isnt my first time flying with jal and i highly recommend taking this airline,5
in early march i took my first flight on the relatively new jal dreamliner from melbourne to tokyo boarding was on time and well organised the plane was in good order and service was excellent food quality seemed reasonably good although i didnt eat much as it was a very early morning flight just after midnight the shell style seats in premium economy are good but not great leg room appears excellent but there was two problems first i was in seat c aisle and a support from the seat in front divides the legfoot space in front of you there doesnt seem to be any reason why the support could not have been moved to the edge of the seat in front but then again im not an aircraft engineer i noted that the above was the case in all c and h seats other than the bulkhead row second the seat bottom moves forward and the back slides down when you recline the seat this takes up some of the otherwise generous legroom and seemed a less comfortable position than the usual recline back mode of aircraft seats on my return flight on the to sydney from tokyo i was in the bulkhead row seat k the legroom here is certainly impressive i was able to prop my feet on my cabin bag that i placed against the bulkhead after takeoff of course and get into a good position for a sleep one last thing was that the toilet just behind pe on the ac side of the cabin was especially large a good spot to change into sleepwear if that is what you do on long overnight flights overall good value for money return on a top class airline,4
we chose this flight due to the distance for the positive commentsseat width and seat amenities that we read about have to say i am glad we picked this airline everything was great except for their japanese meal offerings that were a little off for the typical american traveler on our return we worked hard to get an alternative meal choice i say hard because we were on a code share flight and the ball kept being passed back and forth between airlines lesson learned the meal choice lies with the ticketed airline regardless of who flies the plane with attentive flight attendants who bow each time they encounter you to the airport ramp staff who wave as a group when you push backyou cant get mad at them our premium economy gave us a small private plane section and a feeling we were somewhat special over the masses in economy our recliner seat with footrest deferred any guilt we might have by hampering the passenger behind would we fly them again as long as the price is not crazyyes,5
it was my first experience onboard japan airlines and i really like it the crew are very welcoming and theor do their utmost to serve the customer legroom in economy vlass was huge and food are tasty for sure will travel with tis airlines again,5
the first time using jal to fly from jakarta to itami osaka the meal is really good the flight attendant keep on serving you with snack and drinks for drinks you can choose many kind of japanese speciality drinks such as japan beer red wine white wine juice green tea coffee and miso soup one thing that i really like is the space for your legs in my opinion the class that i ride economy class was so cozy and lots of spare room for your leg,4
this was our first trip on jal and what a pleasant surprise if my memory serves me right they never used to have great reviews years agoboy have they turned it around our flights from singapore were flawlesseasy friendly check ins great modern clean and comfortable planesgood food by airline standards but the crowning glory is the cabin crewsthey are fantastic in every areawe usually fly qantas and emirates jal made them look second rate in most areas,5
i flew from haneda to hong kong on japan airlines top level business class suite sky suite iii on a b sky suites have direct aisle access from every seat and in the sky suite iii iteration seats are angled out towards the window on the sides and in the center section the two seats are angled away from each other the same configuration as cathay pacific uses on its long haul business class the seat has a flat platform at the far end of the seat that forms the foot of the bed when the seat is reclined to a fully flat bed and below that platform is an angled foot rest that is used when the seat is reclined as an angled seat rather than as a fully flat bed the seat has a good size video screen and flip down table that swings out toward the passenger there is also storage under the armrest but it cannot be used on takeoff or landing when the armrest must be pushed down to be flushed with the seat the recline is a bit awkward as there are not presets that can quickly recline to several seat positions such as upright for eating slight recline for watching entertainment and zposition for resting other than sleeping on a fully flat bed instead you have to press the recline button which then reclines that whole seat in a preset path ie you cannot separately operate the seat back and leg portion of the seat for a short haul flight from haneda to hong kong this was not an issue and the seat is very comfortable for such a flight for a longer haul flight the lack of options might be more bothersome to be fair though the fully flat seat offering is much superior to competitors such as cathay pacific which offers only regular slightly wider reclining seats for business class on the route entertainment movies selection was good wifi is available on the flight lunch was a choice between japanese and a couple of western choices and as usual for japan airlines was very good i had the japanese meal with a starter box of a half dozen or so different appetizers and then two hot items with rice i also tried one of two sakes on offer and it turned out to be a small full glass bottle served chill and was good dessert was hagen daz ice cream jal serves a special coffee in business class which is only available on board and i always order it because it is very good strong and smooth with low acidity just the way i like it service as always is superb the toilets are always clean because the flight attendants never stop going in to clean them prior to the flight i used the jal first class lounge at haneda airport and had breakfast there was a good selection of food though less variety than at lunch or dinner that i tried when in the lounge for other flights there was a chef on duty who made galettes crepes folded around melted cheese and ham to order and he was very popular with the guests in the lounge with a constant line of customers for his services an oddity of the lounge is that the wifi seems to be confined to certain areas whereas other areas do not seem to have wifi coverage and may be intended as quiet areas,5
a modern airdcraft with one of the best spaces seats in economy i have experienced the service is excellent the inflight entertainment is not the best in terms of selection but the system works well one major ciriticsm is that the food on this overnight flight was pretty bad a lot worse than normal be prepared that youre not going to get much food at all because the airline works on the premise that people will sleep which is not that easy in economy class so after takeoff all you get is a tiny snack and the next meal is a really bad breakfast before arrival to be fair the meals on the daytime return flight were better also youre not given an amenities kit which is fine as long as you are prepared and bring your own there were some toothbrushes in limited supply in the toiltet though if service reliability and a comfy seat are your priority then japan airlines is certainly a great choice,4
the day we were flying to manila the flight was cancelled due to snow storm in narita no plane was available in san diego due to no flight is taking off from narita the jal staff in san diego did a good job for rerouting us so we can arrived the second day in the morning the service in the plane is aone and the rest rooms are always clean the convenience flying from san diego is outstanding one stop and a hrs waiting for a flight to manila,5
my first time experience with jal quite good i had smooth checked in until boarded the flights take off and landing was nice the entertainment good with updated new movie and the food service is also good with plenty variation of the food i love the soup,4
jal is the best airline with good cabin crew good food great entertainment the only minor negative is i cannot online checkin from dfw to busan,5
i go to thailand a few times in order to meet sweetheart for year in that time i always use jal formerly i used ana however ana and trouble occurred twice personally and i have changed to jal since then jal after breakdown greatly changed compared with formerly of course it is in good direction i change into jal and think that i was correct answer reason i use japanese airline is clear because there is heart of hospitality when i use jal i can be spending traffic with thailand comfortably i use business class of usually business class of was renewed and became more comfortable i like jal as my private impressions i will love jal and will use jal from now on also,5
i often use nonjapanese airlines because japanese airlines are usually expensive but i used japan air lines this time for business trip i was impressed by great meal on the plane such as soba black wheat noodle and soup stock cabin attendants were always kind and polite to passengers i want to use jal next time if price was affordable,5
we arrived to japan airlines and was promptly treated as if royalty the same could be said for all the passengers we were with including in economy class the seats lay almost flat in business class food was exceptional and the anytime menu really helped curb late night cravings during this hour flight i cannot say enough positive comments about jal and hope that many who read this review will consider to fly them to japan from the usa as well,5
fantastic experience in premium economy at ft in tall even room to spare in terms of legroom for me seats were fantastic as they were the fixed shell type so if the passenger in front adjusted their seat no problem you didnt get their seatback in your face great choice of films on the touchscreen monitor film choice changes every month cabin crew were so attentive drinks when you wanted jal is my carrier of choice flying this route,5
i fly jal busoness class internationally on a regular basis their flight crews are very attentive and the food is quite good ive also found jal fares to be very competitive,4

i usually fly ana or sq for my tpac flights out of lax but i decided to try jal out after hearing positive reviews shortly after booking i realized i made a terrible mistake unlike the other airlines i usually fly jal did not allow me to select my seats in advance not even for an additional fee i was forced to wait until check in hours before the flight this is definitely not ideal for hour long flights further compounding that they do not even have a function english language app their app just contains hyperlinks to the website this makes checking in while traveling very difficult especially when you cannot get to a computer hours before your flight i was able to get an aisle seat at checkin but i do not care for suspense and drama when it comes to travel another issue i had was regarding their baggage policy my return flight from sin to lax was booked as a single leg but it contained layovers in hnd and kix the ground staff at sin tagged my bags through to lax informing me that i would only need to collect them once at hnd to clear customs since the following flight was a domestic flight i was supposed to be able to recheck them at hnd to lax unfortunately after being ran around three different areas in two different terminals by the jal ground staff at hnd they insisted on ripping off the hndkixlax tag and insisted on making me retrieve my bag at kix since my flight was late at night i did not have the option to recheck the bag or leave at lost luggage for my morning flight to lax the actual service on the airplane was fine the food was ok and the entertainment options were acceptable the service was slightly better than na or eu airlines offer but not on par with their asian rivals the older planes had decent room in economy but the newer planes were as cramped as any other airline all the hassle and stress from the trip will ensure that i will return to ana and sq for my annual tpac needs moving forward,3
return flight booked directly online via jal portal check or i thought it was itinerary emailed out a little ambiguous given departure was am missed my flight due to itinerary ambiguity partially my fault now the real test of customer service or lack of surfaces log into jal portal entire booking deleted hastily make contact with jal to confirm and salavage booking language differences and lack of empathy prove to be challenging advised a no show penalty will apply however no ref of a no show fee in terms and conditions customer service approach pay fee to secure flights unable secure return flight as cancelled by their system lose return flight needed to be rerouted to sydney pay a higher fee book local flights customer service delegation authority lacking care factor zero customer service approach to solving customer concern low or non existent language challenges,2
comfortable seats for long flight there are free chips nuts and water in the galley area that you can take as you like good to walk around a bit there to stretch the legs and have some chips entertainment was quite standard for long flight with movies and games,4
bought the air tickets months before the date most of the economy class tickets are pretty pricey by then the premium economy tickets are just cost usd more took a red eye flight to tokyo from singapore premium economy tickets allow passengers to use the airport lounge before departure at both airports singapore changi airport tokyo haneda airport leg room is plenty most passengers seems to be resting okay i am someone who is unable to sleep on flight checkin counter is fast service from the air crews is good no complaints will choose jal again if i when i am flying to japan from singapore,5
our flight was delayed and that was a little frustrating our checking process took longer than needed also they cant check a bag when you have more than segments in your reservation and we had four so that delayed us a bit as they tried to figure it out and eventually just checked our bags to narita japan the lounge that jal uses in guam is absolutely terrible its gone down hill drastically in the last years that said once we got on the airplane things went well the crew was so friendly and caring they seemed to genuinely want to be helpful food was pretty good quality nice champagne and even better sake flying them long haul today and looking forward to it,4
im a frequent international traveler base out of shanghai and flying to japan in particular to times a year and this is my second bad experience with them in a row and i will no longer fly jal again if you dont fly much and are not fussy about where you sit fly them they provide good service on board as well as good food with great entertainment i however always asks for certain seats when i fly and with most airlines would give me these seats when they are available but with jal i just always seem to get lies after lies about the availability of these seats i would rather have them just tell me a reason why they cant have these seats than to have them lie about them over and over again about how they have been reserved and after boarding seeing obvious non frequent travelers many chinse where i fly out of have never even been on a plane would not even care where they sit let alone preselect these siting in these seats that i specifically show up early to get well no more jal is never the cheapest i fly them hoping to get a little better service than others if i dont even get the normal service i get from other cheaper airlines why fly them,1
the seat room was larger than a few of the other airlines and the inflight movie selection was fine the attendants were very polite and accommodating our dinner was nice and we were offered both a western and traditional japanese meal choice but breakfast was very traditional and i couldnt come at mushroom soup for breakfast,4
was rather vary when my flight booked for ba was confirmed to be on a code share partner jal as previous experiences with baa code share from usa have been more than disappointing jal was absolutely brilliant service comfort and attitude of staff would now consider jal for this sector o my next trip,5
boarding was efficient and departure on timeseats had extra leg room spaceseat could recline a little and was comfortable for a short haul flight lounge near the departure gate was very convenientlounge food was excellent with wide choices and for alcohol drinkers a fantastic variety to pick from on a self serve basismany plug points for laptops and cell phones cabin service was excellent and flight entertainment channels very goodcabin was clean and had ample luggage spacetoilets were sufficient and very clean food provided was ok nothing greati would have preferred less fried food and more of their pickles insteadi love the plum winehaagen das ice cream was a welcome choice though i would have preferred japanese green tea ice creams captain spoke good english and we arrived ahead of time,4
attendants were thoughtful and careful to passengers would recommend to fly again i thought to food on board coming home was better than the food going there somehow,5
the staff on jal are amazingly helpful polite immaculately presented always professional the seats are comfortable lie flat with added foam mattress available the food drink choices are varied substantial,5
i fly to the philippines once or twice each year and i always fly on japan air atleast three quarters of my flight the service of the crew is always very professional and to me stars japan air is by far miles above all usa carriers hands down the take great pride in serving you making sure no matter what fare you bought you are comfortable if you fly to asia and have the chance try japan air jal you will have a great experience and a good flight,5
great flight and service from staff there is always something very unique and special about flying with jal love it so much and highly recommend it,5
decent flight took off and landed on schedule bags arrived quickly nothing to complain about all good,5
aside from emirates i rate this as one of my other favorite airlines and why impeccable service love the boeing dreamliner seat configuration and yes the bags allowance kgs each good for shopaholic like me in terms of food always order the jap style to try different small dishes only thing which is lacking amenity bag which is made of a small string pouch with some moisture mask and socks ya perhaps its not really a long haul about hours but still if it is an overnight flight should consider a better kit other than that always a pleasure to fly with jal,5
if flying internationally buy your domestic segments from out of country for best prices then get to the airport early and buy an upgradeonly yen for business and yen for first first is a dream separate security use of great lounges fabulous meal onboard for less than usd a segment well worth it just the meal and drinks are worth the price but the comfort and ease of priority checking loading etc make it the best way to pretend you are always a front of bus type,5
japan airlines has the worst customer service period they never answer their customer service lines im tired of calling and waiting over minutes for a response their online website is down and their land building will be out of power this weekend hope their flight is better because everything else is pretty embarrassing for an airline that touts itself as being one of the best so sad,1
i traveled extensively internationally before retirement and this trip rates as the absolute worst travel experience of my life our flight to tokyo connecting city to bangkok left with an initial hour delay this was ok as they contacted us and forewarned although this put our tokyo connection in jeopardy we arrived in tokyo with enough time to make our connection as everything was delayed due to a snow storm this is where things began to go south btw it was a total of we boarded the plane and then sat onboard hours while it was deiced x at the hour mark we were informed that all flights were cancelled and the airport was closing we were not allowed to disembark for another hours approx am i realize an airline is not responsible for weather but this is when jal really failed upon disembarking we were given a sheet of paper with phone numbers to rebook ourselves in the morning we along with thousands of others slept on the floor not jal issue however in the morning we all discovered the phone numbers given did not work more so when jal opened their ticketing windows they flatly refused to service anyone on a cancelled flight and informed us that they were taking care of the passengers booked for that day first they would not help anyone hundreds of people they realized the self rebooking numbers werent working and still would not assist we were informed that perhaps that evening or the next day they would be able to assist cancelled passengers in the end we booked a flight with thai airways for latter morning to bangkok at a cost of for a one way from tokyo to bangkok needless to say i will never fly jal again and will urge anyone who hears of our nightmare to do the same,1
we used avios british airways frequent flyer points to redeem for a jal one world partner flight on the tokyo haneda to sapporo new chitoise sector of our japan itinerary for the rest of our trip we used the ana tourist travel pass highly recommended jpy per sector jal also do a tourist pass but they dont fly the ishigaki leg we required but there were no travel pass tickets on the date we required on jal or ana i remembered that you can redeem avios on jal and there were reward flights available for the bargain avios and tax yes you read that right tax you can check reward availability on the ba website when logged in to your executive club account we couldnt check in online as it was a reward booking and there was a moment of anxiety at checkin when the agent was concerned that miss as a prefix in japan means child and this was not a valid adult ticket but this was resolved largely to our ignorance as we dont speak japanese the had seats across and was full there is a camera on the inflight screens so you can watch takeoff and landing live from the nose using avios made our itinerary and our budget possible,4
amenities on the airplane and food is always great this trip it felt like the crew catered more to the japanese speaking travelers dont know if its because they have trouble speaking english upon arriving to narita they did not offer us a disembarkation card to fill out although we saw them give to others we just thought it was a form only for non foreigners on our way back to hawaii wish they were more knowledgeable about the custom declaration form when asked a questions she had to go find out and came back with i thnik so i think maybe next time we want to go to japan we will try another airlines,4
after many flights using lowest price as a bench mark tried jal and what a difference service a plus nice food drinks includedheadphone too good selection of free entertainmentnew dream liners very quiet good leg room larger washrooms checking even in long line ups super fast and stress free will use them in future as the price was very similar to chinese line with zero service on same trip last year,5
flight for this destination with a stop over in narita airport tokyo the flight was well priced and the service was friendly and professional the first leg was a hour flight leaving after midnight and it was pleasing to not be given a full meal after take off a snack packwith treats and water was issued and coffee and tea etc the breakfast was a large spread with a main course along with fruit yogurt salad and a croissant and coffee etc in all a comfortable flight with a good range of tv and movies and a pillow and blanket,5
upon entering the aircraft my impression was that the crew was not enthusiastic about service before departure we in business class got a tiny plastic cup of champagne or sparkling wine then we got a towel that was wet and cold after takeoff it took minutes before we were asked what we would like to drink twenty minutes later i had to call and ask then another ten minutes i had asked to get dinner served quick but it took more than three hours before i could finish the main course skipping dessert in order to sleep the contrary to my request i was called three hours before arrival in order to have breakfast upon my complaint the answer was that the cabin had to be cleared before arrival on a ten and a half hour night flight i could sleep for four hours,1
excellent from start to finish very efficient check in business lounge boarding friendly staff only hic cup food average,5
bkk checkin handling by tg thai airways and supervised by jl staff the checkin was smooth and fast bkk sakura lounge spacious lots of seats with power point to recharge battery food and drinks were pretty good beef curry stirfried chicken with holy basil leaves gapao were very popular they tasted very nice there were also restrooms in the lounge inflight ber sky wider economy class bulkhead seat was spacious with lots of leg room meal servicesupper had fried rice with grilled salmon a bit dried and light taste soba noodles were very nice service from cabin crew were excellent overall very very good,5
this was our first time on jal we fly regularly to australia and wanted to have a change of stopover rather than singapore or dubai so stopped in tokyo for three nights i cannot recommend this enough tokyo was fantastic jal business class was actually quite a bit cheaper than ba or emirates so we were nervous of what to expect we were delighted with everything staff are delightful the flights departed and arrived exactly on time business class seats were far better than both ba and emirates the food was fabulous especially from tokyo to sydney jal is definitely our preferred airline for london to sydney and we cannot wait to experience kyoto on the way back,5
travelled business class tokyo narita to australia sydney good business lounge check apart from the australian slob in shorts thongs excellent onboard service amenities food check so why not the seats comfortable but surprisingly narrow im cm kg sufficiently so as to make it difficult to sleep in my preferred position no not transversely not a problem in a daylight flight but this was an overnight flight,4
ca checked my name before offering a more relaxed seat mr so and so would you like to have more room by moving from f to say b it helped not only me but also other people to enjoy more leg room and space i was able to sleep almost flat using seats,4
i used the jal to fly back to vietnam twice last month in january the first time was good and without any hicup the second time was not so well when we reached tokyo japan there was a snow that covered about less than inches both the airport and the airline did not know what to do and decided to cancel out more than flight include the one i was on i had to seat inside the plane from pm to am next morning there were more than people stranded at the airport and the jal did not provide any information any rebooking information and any accommodations to those people lots of them missed meetings family emergency business meetings and even charity groups missed charity works i was willing to purchase another ticket but unfortunately it was on saturday and no tickets available all other airlines also ran into same situation there was not much communication between customers and the airline counters either we were literally begging for information communication and tried to get on another flight by standing by options it was a nightmare and was not a good experience at all,3
i was startled with the food they served us i had to spit them out so grossed i love japanese food but boy what they served us presentation wise was really good the taste was awful i had to asked the fa a bowl of udon noodles that also wasnt good i starved myself on that flight my hubby didnt even eat at all after he saw me making faces when i tried them food no offense jal just didnt like what you served us,3
i usually use jal if i have flight after jal bankruptcy it will be better for example how to communicate with passengers some information and any service for passengers airplane is kept in clean id like to recommend anybody to use jal if you need to have flights,4
i was recommeded to fly jal and it did not disappoint me at all infact it set new standards for both in air and on ground service it would great to have better movie selection as most movies english were quite popular once only and it would be nice they can put some japanese movies with subtitles,4
you always get your moneys worth with jal my recent flight to singapore was no exception premium economy is a very attractive proposition comfortable enough to work and relax good quality headphones to enjoy the wide selection of movies tasty food miso beefand of course pleasant service my only gripe would be with online checking this is supposed to save time so why do we need to go to the check in counter to get a stamp on our boarding pass,5
i have flown jal many times before and have always found them a great airline the economy seats are very roomy and comfortable the selection of things to watch on your personal screen is excellent the staff are very friendly and welcoming which all helps making your flight pleasurable my airline of choice for flying to japan would be jal,5
this flight comes with only one meal breakfast so you can go straight to sleep after takeoff its quite comfortable seats are arranged from left to right on the b staff noted my birthday and prepared a small treat,5
this is my first time taking jal to japan and simply love it until this trip my previous trips had always been on singapore airline due to the timing and also the use of my krisflyer points of late using points to redeem a trip is not worth as much as it should be and decided to try some other airlines instead to my surprise jal is not only cheaper but still offers great timing and great economy class seat timing i like to fly in late at night and reach the destination early morning so that i dont have to waste a day of my precious holiday there similarly i like to fly out late at night to save you guessed it a day of my precious holiday jal has that great economy class seat great leg room great recliner seat inflight entertainment screen is huge i suspect that im going to be a jal fan for a long while whenever i fly to japan,5
when i pay times the cost of economy i expect a little more a larger seat first boarding some nice refreshment or a meal allowance for heavier luggage or more luggage etc the staff members at jal on the ground and in the air were all very nice but oddly business boards in the last zone with general boarding fist zone was special needs and anyone with children so that was already ⅓ or more of the plane then zone is those with recognized status i forgot what zone is but after that is general boarding so already you dont get any special treatment the seats were slightly larger than economy and my lb suitcase was permitted there was a lot of activity with the attendants so i figured they were preparing some food for the hours in the air but the only thing they did was give everyone on the plane tiny paper cup of juice coffee or tea there was nothing else re entertainment there is none but wifi was free that was nice cost of flight was about rt and length of flight about hours each way ill have to try a different airline next time it was disappointing,3
we were treated royally from checkin to arrival in tokyo and then bangkok there was great food service and comfort throughout the almost hours of travel we look forward to the return flight back to san diego,5
beautiful new boeing crew were amazing super friendly prompt and efficient aircraft was spacious and nice atmosphere mimicking a night flight during the day with the window tint and dimmed lights it meant pax could sleepmakes the flight go much faster,5
friendly helpful ground and cabin staff centre bulkhead seats with lots of legroom clean boeing with pleasant cabin layout ontime departure but minute arrival delay owing to changi airport airspace overcrowding,4
our first experience of japan was on our japan airline flight to kushiro and it exceeded our expectations the staff welcomed us in english and constantly checked if we needed assistance thankfully they also announced all the inflight messages in english for us which we deeply respect since we were the only english speaking passengers on board i highly recommend jal domestic and will be flying again very soon,5
we have been a fan of japan airlines for a long time almost thirty years in economy class the service is professional the food is good and the seats are comfortable because of our gold status on american they have provided upgrades to us in the past that even american has not this was our second experience with their business class we had flown from dallas to narita in business class as well on both the flights the main meal was superb and the rest of the options for food and drinks were tasty and nicely served i was surprised though that for such a long flight they only have one scheduled meal and rest is whenever you wish you almost wish they had another lighter scheduled meal the sky suite gives a fully flat seat with extra cushion bed provided if needed the planes are relatively new models and are fairly quite compared to our business class experience in other airlines this is still far better,5
we cant fault jal the checkin was effortless the staff are very friendly and attentive and the food is probably the best inflight food we have had love the warm face towels they hand out so you can freshen up the plane was very clean and the seats were comfortable would definitely fly with jal again,5
comfortable seat for an hour or so long flight j class cabin a drinks service was offered and was offered a refill on a no ife available,4
a lot of other airlines could learn from jal we travel a lot and when it comes to long haul flights we fly business jal definitely has the best service and kindest people,5
wonderful flight in business class individual suite seats first class lounge at the airport great service this was the first time flying jal and we were very impressed,5
flew japan airlines from seoul gimpo airport to tokyo haneda on economy simple efficient flight on a saturday took hours to reach tokyo from seoul gimpo polite service with a simple japanese dinner nicely served only drawback about jal is check in is only allowed hours before flight which means you have to store my luggage somewhere if you arrived in gimpo early,5
ontime flight efficient and friendly service business class flight included service to the sakura lounge sakura lounge offered charging stations at each seat food offerings were heavily japanese as opposed to international offerings,5
from start to finish i cant fault this airline the staff are always helpful the food is good and the plane is clean we have now traveled with them several times and i would highly recommend spending a bit extra and go premium economy i take an ipad with movies etc on it as the movies are mainly catered to japanese people which you would expect there is always plenty of food and drink during the flight i will always use them,5
although a short flight of minutes there is time for a free hot or cold drink as always with jal the flight was on time the plane is a flying west from tokyo to osaka if the weather is clear you get a fantastic view of mount fuji from the plane for the best view get a window seat on the right side of the plane if flying from osaka to tokyo the best to get a window seat on the left,5
the flight was on time the economy seats on jal are very good with enough legroom only a short flight but enough time for a drink of tea coffee or juice no charge landing at narita was on time and smooth this flight now uses one of the new gates at narita terminal so it is a long walk to get out,5
having not flown to japan in economy before i was a little worried about leg room as i am over ft tall i was pleasantly surprised upon sitting down and was even more pleased when no one was occupying the middle seat in flight entertainment was pretty good with a nice selection of films good quality audio and screen worked well food on the flight out was good and bad on the way back staff where polite and the plane was clean certainly better a flight than i thought and would use it again for future trips to japan,4
remember the days when airlines actually catered to their customers some years ago well neither do i because i was only then and as much as i though those days were long gone and they pretty much are its so refreshing to actually come off a hr flight and honestly say it was enjoyable i have to admit i find it hard to sleep on any plane but the middle seats in business are the ultimate in isolation from anything around you just put up the adjacent partitions and voila also jals meal service is great offer choice of either western or japanese menu and after the initial service you can order anything a la carte anytime up until hrs before landing directly from ur personal communication device the movie selections could be better and more numerous but not a problem on this overnight the service from the extremely friendly and accommodating flight attendants could not have been better see my separate review of aa flight over to japan for a harshly contrasting experience,5
this was the return flight with jl and we found premium economy to be a good experience im a larger build guy and did find the bottom of the seat could be uncomfortable after a few hours however the food and service was of a high standard and as good as any other airline in this class also there was good space for personal articles and inflight baggage though the entertainment service was a little limited other then movies english shows were limited,4
would fly again great first class service and excellent flight friendly stewardesses good entertainment an enjoyable long flight,5
excellent service after traveling on delta from the us to india flying with jal in economy felt like first class the staff is great they really made us feel welcomed the food was delicious the seats were comfortable spacious and clean definitely helped on a hour flight this was my first time flying with jal but i look forward to flying with jal again,5
i have visited japan many times for last years this is the first time to fly with jal from chicago to narita in tokyo i get used to the service of other flight companies i was so pleased and happy by kind and pleasant services by all of attendants even though it took over hours i felt the flight was so quick definitely i will choose jal next time,5
have flown jal many times and always been happy with this airline however this time i found the dreamliner premium economy seats uncomfortable and the foot rest was awkward to adjust my husbands would not lower at all the worst aspect though was the awful food which was served as an initiative to give young chefs an entree into the world of commercial cooking i could not eat the thick vegetable soup accompanied by a hard roll which was served for breakfast the dinner was luke warm and tasteless it seems they were trying to serve western food instead of sticking to their own specialities of noodles delicate sauces and small dishes i would think hard about using this airline next time on this route the problem is the opposition has two night time flights and this only has one would consider for flights to uk via japan as service is usually excellent planes on time clean and reasonably priced,3
it was very convenience for us to go to tokyo from our town nanki shirahama airport was small but very clean and easy to move around they have a good restaurant onsite,5
my wife and son and i recently returned from our skiing vacation from hokkaido with jal we did not get seats together although it could have been arranged by the flight crew if they wanted to the premium economy seats are very uncomfortable they also land from syndney in narita and you connection is from haneda which is an hour away by bus i dont recommend flying jal if you can avoid it,2
from leg room to food choices to cabin service this is simply the best economy flight we have flown did a recent trip to asia and returned hong kong to tokyo to boston via jal the food was particularly good the closest to restaurant quality we have had and the stop at the amazing international terminal at narita airport was a real experience the only way to go from tokyo to boston,5
we just came back from bangkok via tokyo to the us what an experience flying with japan airlines i had forgotten the feeling of respect confort and proper manners while traveling on a flight everything was perfect actually more than perfect the sense of being treated special as if you were the only passenger in the plane every employee dedicated their entire time to make you feel confutable made the trip a pleasure absolutely amazing japan airlines looking forward flying again with jal,5
i caught jal flight from singapore to tokyo hours duration and me and my family loved it the service was great especially i have a yrs old boys with me and they were considerate in very detail the crew reminded me to take my boy to bathroom as the plane is going to land this showed they put customer in their priority the airplane food were good seats were wider and had more legroom than other airlines can offer we were in economy class the plane is b i do recommend to catch jal if you intend to go to japan you wont disapoint,5
the service and flight attendants a cleanliness of the plane immaculate food was very good with a japanese touch in flight entertainment excellent best part were the seats plenty of room and lots of legroom,5
out of the two japanese airlines ana and jal i still find that jal offered good inflight service for a decent pricefor sgd for two way flight it a bargain the legroom for the economy class is spacious enough food is good in my opinion and the inflight entertainment especially movies were good a mix of s movies and to the latest the flight attendants were friendly and go out of their way to make sure your flight are comfortable the only gripe i have with the airline is their customer service it seems like no one manned their call center,4
flight sydnrtsyd economy classexcellent customer service comfortable seatsgood selection quality of food and drinks,5
we flew round trip to tokyo on japan airlines and we had excellent service and a great flight our flight attendants went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and to offer us samples of japanese food and wine,5
tokyo to manila economy class b all staff were amazing very accommodating and hospitable the seats were great and there was a good amount of legroom the inflight entertainment had good movies selection although theres always room for improvement especially with those monitors nevertheless it was always great flying with them and my number one go to airline,5
i book tickets for a family trip april via expediacom website before the flight i had to cancel trip after conversation with an expedia customer representative japan airlines agreed to give me credit for next trip and this information has been posted on my expedia account because of this japan airline credit i missed many chances to buy cheap tickets from other airlines few days ago i called expedia to book tickets using my credit after waiting hours of conversation between expedia and jal customer representatives i was told that i have zero credit,1
checkin at first class counter was excellent as was separate security counter for first class and emerald one world customers lounge was small very clean with comfortable seats limited food salmon sushi curry puff or miso soup with tea coffee soft drinks or whiskey and beer one english language newspaper single copy was there on the day boarding was pretty crowded with no priority queue for f and j class seating was standard domestic j class with no av only service offered was coffeeteacold soft drink with not even a biscuit for less a meal this is really a bus service with no frills in the air,3
i travelled to south korea and japan weeks ago and i have to say jal was excellent the flight attendants were so professional and kindthe food was great and the leg room spacious considering it was economy sectioni look forward to flying japan airlines in the future,5
absolute worst customer service and experience with this airline on my honeymoon and paid for an upgrade on the way to my destination and halfway was downgraded they blamed jfk for not properly communicating the upgrade was only halfway why would i pay for an upgrade to only receive half of it and even the half that i did have had no wifi on the flight and it was a hour flight either way we got the runaround with a few different people at the haneda airport most notably was an incredibly rude manager masami ohashi i was shocked when she said she was a manager because the way she spoke and handled this was incredibly unprofessional so rude and i felt extremely disrespected i was interrupted nonstop by no no no no solution unless you pay more we spoke with other staff members at haneda and bangkok and they promised to accommodate us on our returning flight but then when that time came they said oh sorry we cant the flight is full for those seats meanwhile we saw open seats on the plane just terrible lying to customers to save the money we paid and avoid refunding it very cheap horrible experience i will never ever fly with this airline again dont use them if you want to avoid the worst headache and rude customer service i would give zero stars if i could,1
i took the direct over the night flight leaving haneda at night and arrive san francisco early afternoon business class cabin including the sakura lounge in haneda is fabulous the only disappointment is the sakura lounge in san francisco airport this has not changed for decades but the facility and the service they provide is far from the satisfactory level of that of other leading airlines 出張で羽田夜発サンフランシスコ昼頃到着直行便をビジネスクラスで搭乗した搭乗キャビン羽田でのサクララウンジは期待通りの満足を得られた食事睡眠仕事環境どれとっても遜色無い 予想通りだが唯一の不満はサンフランシスコ国際空港のサクララウンジのショボさ米国全体に言えるのかも知れないが他国他強豪のラウンジのレベルに比べてとてもじゃないがビジネスクラス向けとは言いがたいレベルである,4
on december i booked and paid online for a roundtrip ticket for my mom outbound from hochiminh city vietnam to san diego ca on feb and return on may unfortunately for some personal reasons a few weeks later i had to call them for rescheduling our flights onto feb and april after at least hours waiting on the line an operator answered my phone and told me that i had to pay extra for rescheduling including changing fee and the rest for difference in fare i agreed with that cost because i know the ticket price was no longer the same logically the price must raise up day by day however i checked the current price of my mom flights on their website a few days ago i was shocked knowing that the price at that moment is only which is lower than my actual payment and even cheaper than our first booking pricethey really know how to disappointing their customers i booked months earlier and accepted the possibility that i may have to pay more for rescheduling because i didnt want to buy tickets when the price are already raise up however it turned out to be my silly decision that really doesnt make any sense to me jal has really brought me into the feeling that my family was tricked by the brand that we has been supporting for years,1
on th jan me and my brother were supposed to take flight from fukuoka am from singapore through transit at haneda am around considering we bought our ticket through jal main site we didnt think much of the transit time as we had done so multiple times in the past though this time we noticed there was staff waiting for us to gave us a monorail ticket to domestic terminal we managed to get out of immigration and luggage at am around which is min slower than my previous trip and would proceed to interchange counter to drop my bag usually however this time they want us to take monorail to domestic with our luggage we got to station at am and board the train on am we approached the reception counter at around and after some phone by the staff we were asked to push our checked in baggage through security to go on plane as cabin luggage however as we got to security our swiss army knife that usually accompany our checked in baggage were not allowed to go through and we were asked to abandon them which we are not willing due to the price of them and hence we do not board the am flight to add insult to injury we were told we could only be put on stand by without any promise of when or if we could get on to any plane we decided to find other way to get to fukuoka after another attempt at their ticketing office which result in no ticket so we wasted more money and lots of time on our first day to japan where jal effectively left us in lurch at haneda airport the final blow by jal was on rd day of the trip the same day im writing this where i went online to check my reservation and noticed it cannot be selected and my brother reservation just disappeared im with their jal mileage club which makes me think our tickets have been cancelled and effectively not only leaving us at lurch in haneda but also in japan with no ticket to get back to singapore there were of course no email about cancellation of our return ticket or any form of notifications at this moment we are stuck in japan with no ticket to get back given that all fukuoka seats were full that day my gut says its jal elaborated way to seat bump passengers for their more prestigious members unlike david dao incident if we were allowed to check in our baggage we would be on plane if swiss knife army an issue the staff could keep hold of them till we alight and we could board the plane im currently reaching our to jal on my rd day to check on my flight status before i escalate the situation accordingly my advice is avoid jal at all cost the slight edge of their company recently over ana due to ana silly baggage policy few years ago which they have since fixed had made them complacent avoid avoid avoid,1
in the second leg from saigon to tokyo to vancouver with jal excellent service with reasonable leg room food in second leg muncher better than first but the barbque wasnt working will certainly fly with them again by the way they ran out of ice cream on second leg of trip not thats bad,5
flight staff were extremely helpful and welcoming and all spoke english flight leaves early and arrives early with a long night for those who have trouble sleeping the two stages are of equal length unlike the alternatives through the middle east and south east asia which involve one particularly long leg we arrived refreshed and ready to start the day with no sign of jet lag unlike previous trips there is a long stopover in tokyo where you are required to collect your luggage and transfer by road between airports however when you arrive at haneda staff are ready to take your luggage straight away so you are not required to hang on to it till checkin opens haneda has a hotel adjacent to the departure lounge where you can have a meal and catch a few hours sleep after airline checkin this means you can sleep until minutes before departure we left sydney on the sunday a week before christmas and were very pleased to discover that the monday morning flight is not popular with travellers the plane was only about a quarter full particularly in economyevery set of four seats was occupied by just one person sleeping across all four how often do you see that on a flight to europe,5
it started hours late with no notifications and they have hours to call email or text then after getting in flight tokyo to bangkok with inches of snow sat on ground hours at which time they cancelled and made us wait hrs more to deplane with very lame excuses after that no customer service and thank sue from american for rebooking when we finally boarded new flight they were hours late loading cargo or whatever thats the short version ill spare you the other nasty smelly parts,1
during the recent tokyo heavy snow on january i was flying home on a jal flight jal loaded up our plane and then several hours later unloaded us at midnight with minimal explanation the captain was almost unintelligible and then washed their hands of us at narita airport once we were hustled back to the check in part of narita there were literally no jal staff there to offer and advice or assistance to the thousands of their customers who they had unceremoniously tossed off their planes the only help we received was the advice that there were no hotel rooms and a poorly worded piece of paper which gave a range of phone numbers for us to call none of which worked because they were closed for the night apart from sleeping on the floor of the airport which i get the bit i dont get why the next morning should have been bedlam and chaos the few jal staff who turned up after their refreshing nights sleep had no idea they were clueless about what we should do next they kept referring us to a reservations number which wouldnt answer it was a farce and everyone was openly laughing at the incredibly poor service that jal provided i am convinced that jal lost many many thousands of future customers that night i finally got through to that jal number almost hours later and was offered a flight back a week later via singapore i just laughed and asked whether it was an early april fools day joke by that stage i had given up on jal my experience with qantas was the complete opposite they were at pains to help and got us on a flight the next day home in short they were fantastic the complete opposite to jal still havent heard a peep from jaland if course never will it makes you wonder about the culture at jal that they literally abandoned their passengers at their home base for half a day without any help points to the fact that the airline and its leadership have severe problems the reason i am writing this is in the hope that someone from jal reads this and understands that their performance that night was completely unacceptable for my part i will never ever fly on jal again,1
its impossible to get through the phone with jal i have been on a call for more than an hour calling from north american line unbelievable if theres any issue on line its impossible to get through so tiring so exhausting kal picks up the phone at least within min this jal airline is terrible on customer service centre,1
i cannot say enough good things about japan airlines for the wonderful customer service i received on a december flight near the end of a hour layover in toyko my husbands name was called from the gate while he was away taking a walk when i grabbed all of our bags to run over to find out why i mistakenly left my brand new ipad on the chair black cover on a black chair i didnt see it while rushing i only realized it was missing right before the plane took off i told a flight attendant who was very kind and helpful throughout the flight to work on helping me find it i cannot thank her enough another airline person met me when i got off the plane to get my information and i soon received a follow up email and several after that to follow up we arranged for the item to be flown to ho chi minh city where i was able to pick it up a couple of weeks later again with the help of a very nice employee i hope we get to fly japan airlines again between that and providing my husband with a very nice glutenfree meal he has celiac disease it was an exceptional experience,4
fly singaporehanedachitosehanedanaritasingapore had to transfer at haneda before continuing to chitose on domestic flight clear signs were given had to clear immigration and claim baggage when at haneda onwards to chitose staff were courteous and attentive they will bow before flight commences will definitely consider fly on jal besides other flights,4
our family of adults and children flew premium economy from sydney to paris via tokyo excellent service by onboard crew great access to airport lounges limited movie options ordinary food but quite comfortable inconvenient transfer from sydney to paris via tokyo as overnight stay required and hour bus to change airports which we had to arrange ourselves our last flight from tokyo to sydney was cancelled due to the snowstorm on promised hotel and food vouchers when disembarking after hours on the plane instead all hotels were full understandably with flights cancelled left with a sleeping bag water and crackers to spend the night in narita airport i wasnt too concerned and was willing to put up with a sleepless night to avoid unsafe conditions i assumed we would fly out in the morning on the same plane it seemed logical atrocious communication and followup service nobody to speak to for hours we were told that our flight was cancelled obviously and wed have to call a number to book another flighton the public phone or use for those without international roaming hours of waiting no answer on the number given no ground staff to talk to we were fortunate that we booked through flight centre who were excellent and got us on a qantas economy flight days after our original flight which jal covered they wouldnt however cover our accommodation or other expenses we also had to get from narita to haneda another saga of train changes with kg of luggage due to more delays and cancellations others at the airport who booked online directly with jal were left with no assistance and hours of waiting without information or food i am unaware of how they managed after we left the queue of hundreds of people with no one attending the desks weather issues are an understandable force of nature being dropped by an airline like a dirty dish rag is disappointing and unacceptable this airline is excellent when all runs smoothly but terrible when things go wrong ill never fly with jal again,1
fantastic service staff amazing especially c who i fell in love with usually travel business class but had to sit with the riffraff this time lol however the experience in economy with jal wasnt too far off,5
if you want to enter the plane with all the flight crew courteously bowing to greet and welcome you on the flight take jal if you like bento meals take jal if you love love love green tea and kiwi juice take jal if your flight to be on time fly jal,5
i have take this particular flight a number of times if you can get to the airport early and take advantage of the sakura lounge flight left largely on time and after about mins drinks were served food was pretty good and plentiful drinks were served quickly the seat is a full flat bed which is most comfortable for this kind of over night flight i slept after dinner and woke up a couple of hours before landing when i go back to sfo i will most certainly be flying with jal,5
so i paid extra to upgrade from economy to premium economy because i have leg condition and cant really sit long and during the layover i was called upon and the flight attendant asked me if i can give up my seat and swap seats with a family with a baby and i said sure but i paid extra money to get this seat because i have leg issue is it possible to give me a bump up and the attendant looked at me very surprised and replied sorry not possible but if you want you can pay another extra money to upgrade to business class and that is another each person i was like seriously what kind of japanese logic is this i dont get it i ended up saying i will think about it and later i convinced my wife to give up the seats and take the swap with the other family but jal told me it has been taken care of so i dont have to okay i was shocked and embarrassed again by their sarcastic smile what the hell was it wowimpressed never jal again,1
the us airlines american and united in particular would do well to take a long hard look at jals approach to service and passenger wellbeing not just on the flight but before and after as well bottom line didnt want to leave the plane,5
great airline with a good business class layout from ny to tokyo go for the window seats good food helpful service,5
every jal flight for me is pleasant because of the courteous staff service is one of the best ive experienced this particular flight used a b and the seats were very comfortable inflight entertainment was beyond my expectation truly pleasant hour flight,4
we knew this flight was going to be long but what we didnt know was that it was also going to be uncomfortably warm for of the flight what i do not understand about these enormous planes is why you no longer get an air vent above your seat at one point i was fanning myself with the emergency card and the flight attendant came over and assured me that they had turned on the ac if they did it was off again within the hour the service was friendly the food was very mediocre in flight entertainment options were nice being on a hot sweaty plane for plus hours was awful,3
first and foremost nothing beats leavings from haneda rather than narita it is close to the city centre and is less busy when travelling international if you are flying to bkk this particular flight is excellent leaves at midnight and arrives during the early morning therefore you have the whole day to enjoy the aircraft was a b with new economy seats therefore you have a bigger entertainment screen and more leg room the only downside is the food its not very tasty hope this review helps,4
jal premium economy experience is excellent starting with access to jal lounge were you can quietly sit and enjoy food and drinks prior to flight staff advise when boarding commences so you can go directly from lounge to the plane premium economy seats and surrounding space is spacious and comfortable cabin service is friendly and efficient food and drinks plentiful would definitely recommend jal flight to tokyo,4
a simple error in name cannot be corrected after hours on the phone and delays it seems that i will have to cancel and book another ticket due to the delay it will undoubtedly be more expensive and they will charge me around cancellation fees most reputable airlines give you h to make corrections but not this airline they will screw you over while make things as inconvenient and vague as possible,1
good inflight service and entertainment flight meals were impressive loved the themed breakfast set it was too cute,4
my son won a free return ticket to japan and the whole family bought a ticket to travel together with him from penang we took mas and the arrangement was very good where our luggage were check in direct to narita even the airlines were different our flight to japan we smooth there was no delay in departure the stewards were very helpful and friendly we requested for muslim food and they complied child food also served for my years old and she also got a gift from jan our agent arranged for special upgrade to premium economy on our return flight the leg room was better extra accessoriesgoodies were given and we were boarded first before the economy class passenger all in all good travel experience,4
this flight was operated by a boeing jaj with latest sky suite i business class cabin equipped we took off from hong kong international airport runway r at local time and arrived narita international airport runway r at local time i was sitting in seat a the bulkhead business class seat located in the first row of the second compartment no welcome drink was provided prior departure it was standard procedure in hkg nrt route lunch was served at around minutes after take off overall the service is just average it is definitely not up to par the flight was smooth however the cabin of boeing was relatively noisy when comparing with airbus a or boeing,3
caught plane from sydney going to japan hostesses were very friendly and helpful lots of leg room between seats good food it was hot and very tasty very attentive staff would definitely fly with japan airlines,5
we traveled on an aa ticket and were able to get window and aisle seats in row on a my son needs a lot of leg room so we were quite happy with the seats it was easy to get in and out of the aisle so we did not disturb the person sitting in the aisle seat the food was very good i did order vegan meals service was timely and friendly and the plane and restrooms were really clean we enjoyed the hour flight,5
absolutely first class from start to finish impeccably dressed professional smiling eye contact accomodating they open on time they show respect planes are clean food is good plenty of leg room all the screens work highly recommend,5
jal surpassed my expectations great seats with loads of legroom it almost felt like business class the seats are contained within their own pod so the person in front can recline as much as they want without any impact on your space food was good and staff were excellent new boeing aircraft completed an excellent experience premium economy also gets you access to the qantas lounge in sydney if there is a negative jal flies into narita which is much farther from tokyo and the queues in narita on our arrival lasted over an hour however i am guessing that this is not a regular occurrence jal is the best airline i have flown in a long time highly recommend japan airlines,5
jal started nonstart flights again between kona and narita one of few affordable options to fly into narita at a more convenient time noon departure with pm arrival wearing a boot for a heel fracture and flight attendants allowed me to move to a front row in the cabin section entire row was empty so had lots of room to spread out and stretch out my leg dinner food was good and a full meal,4
the adjustment of the light after taking off was very nice it put me into sleep sometimes it is difficult to sleep but it was easy with this considerate way of controlling the light in the aircraft their service is always nice,5
after a less than stellar jal flight from canada to narita we hoped for a better flight and got it overall the veggie meal this time was indeed vegetarian and tasty i was content with the meals quality and quantity in addition the crew were professional yet warm check in boarding and the flight itself were all flawless we arrived to bangkok without incident,5
first time on japan airlines and wasnt expecting much since i had a very difficult time getting a seat and checking in online they wouldnt allow it because it was part of an american airline booking thats their policy but i tried one more time the day of the flight and bingo i was suddenly allowed to check in and pick my seat that flight had together near the window so right away i was happy the seat seemed more comfortable than most economy and the food was excellent served with proper cutlery then the best part the toilets very clean and attractive and they had some gizmo that sprayed your private parts with warm water and i think it also dried it i made sure my husband went to use this awesome toilet i know they have them in japan but i didnt expect to see it in economy i would fly anywhere they would go unfortunately not that many places from where i live,5
from the take off to landing everything was very smooth i traveled with a puppy so i was hoping for a calm flight the puppy was well when she got to the airport food was very very good it is way better than air canada the most important part is i got haagen dazs ice cream for dessert the flight attendants were very welcoming and they even thanked us individually before the landing as long as its not too overpriced id consider flying jal for sure,5
we took this flight as a family of on the dreamliner fitted out with a shell neo product as far as i am concerned this is the best hard product for nonovernight flights the seats are comfy and spacious along with a wide screen for watching a pretty decent selection on the ife the thing that really sets jal apart is the service even though the cabin was full the staff were really attentive and made you feel valued the food was another high point am pretty sure this is as good as plane food gets,5
very friendly and helpful service i found both meals to be above average in quality and portion size than i feel is typical they also brought as all fresh washclothes beforehand the flight had been delayed due to a mechanical issue they replaced a gauge so we missed our connection in tokyo but they had booked us on a new flight and provided us with yen for food snacks upon disembarking the plane so it was a relatively painless inconvenience,5
my first leg from beijing to narita was a good experience and then on to honolulu was among my best flight experiences ever my second leg was a fivehour flight at night so i knew the crew would have some downtime as most passengers would be asleep during the twohour layover at narita i purchased a box of chocolates for the flight attendants to share and gave it to them when boarding they at first thought i wanted them to store the bag for me and i said no it was for them to share with each other now i often do this because i am usually traveling as a backpacker and i am not especially well dressed after weeksmonths on the road on this occasion it was jeans and a great wall tourist teeshirt foremost i like to do it because i know how hard they work and i want to express my gratitude for their efforts that it also removes me from the category of just another person in cattle class in their eyes is a nice bonus i am not sure if bringing a gift hit a japanese cultural button but the reaction was like nothing i had ever experienced before at different points of the flight each attendant stopped by my seat to personally thank me and chat a bit asking if i was a pilot or at least an airline employee i literally could not pay for a drink the champagne flowed all through the night even when i insisted i had not done it for any kind of reward and would like to pay after the second one their response to this was to give me a diecast b in jal livery and more champagne when you fly your three biggest tools are dont be a jerk show appreciation and empathy to the cabin crew express your gratitude before that moment at the door when deplaning,5
having flown jal several times their service is very good and the comfort levels ok they tend to have their cabin temperature quite high,4
one of the best parts of flying with jal are the flight attendants and their professional demeanor i was on a recent flight where some of the passengers were sick and they still kept their composure and smile they are excellent in working with children and infants to make sure they are comfortable and safe my only itch was with a flight attendant that took issues with one person standing up for a few seconds or two people heading to the restroom in what seemed like an emergency hopefully she had a glass of wine or two to decompress and calm her nerves the economy seats from sfo to haneda were the most comfortable but the economy seat that was assigned from narita to lax would have been tight on my knees had it been a middle or window seat i traveled with my much shorter spouse which made the trip a lot more bearable i highly recommend the premium economy seats if traveling from japan to the us since they often make offers to upgrade to premium economy at a reasonable price im not sure what happened to jals inflight dinning i made sure to eat a full meal before entering the plane on my way back to the states inflight dining was much better years ago when i flew jal what they served recently even my kids refused to eat they preferred lunch food than jal inflight dinning they couldnt stand the smell of the soup that they served the only thing that saved the day was the little cartons of haagendazs to make up for the terrible inflight meals i miss the days when flights to japan served bento box style japanese food and my kids actually ate the airplane food and never complained another negative about flying with jal is that if the flight is operated by japan airlines you wont be eligible for tsapre for that flight jal is not a tsa pre participating airline i didnt mind since my children were of the age that allowed us to go through metal detectors instead in the future we would have to book through a participating airline in spite of the negative jal offers some really good international flight deals if you want to fly with jal i do recommend premium economy seating and flying one stop to and from haneda if youre going to tokyo flying through sfo makes for much smoother traveling than flying multiple stops to lax from my experience flying with japan airlines really depends on how you customize your traveling experience it could be a star or star flying experience flying through jal was much better overall than delta or american airlines in my opinion however jal needs to work on their horrible inflight dinning selections and participate in tsa pre i would give my flight experience with jal a overall,3
easy checkin excellent flight attendants wide selection of free movies okay seats with good leg room very good meals very good flight to japan,4
i have flown jal many times for international flights and the stewardesses are topnotch with their service the service is always the best things about the japanese carriers food is always pretty good for airlines food the planes themselves are okay not wow their luggage policy is standard for international carriers decent selection of recent movie releases on the entertainment center they are codeshare with american airlines one can earn some points jal is the only airline that flies direct to san diego from japan nrt,4
it was a red eye flight from singapore to sapporo via tokyo haneda airport the crew of japanese stewardess were most helpful and polite in japanese tradition the flight from singapore to tokyo was shorter than normal probably due to strong tail wind and before we knew it we were awaken by the crew as the plane prepared to descend their food especially japanese menu is quite good for economy class though i would rate ana a shade better jal is still one of my preferred airlines,4
the jal premium economy seats are some of the most spacious available with plenty of space between seats although the recline is only slightly more than economy the seats have hard shells so you never bothered by the seat behind the staff and inflight services are very good and probably represents some of the best value in the oneworld network,4
im used to expecting perhaps wrongly that flying economy on an international flight will be a step above flying domestic economy this is the first time i have felt that this was not the case there were many substandard moments once we got on the plane service prior to boarding was quite good but i will highlight that the saag paneer that i was eating turned out not to be paneer at all but chicken ive ordered countless hindu meals in the past and theyve always been vegetarian but when i brought this to the attention to the head flight attendant she wasnt at all concerned when i asked about the next meal coming up she said mysteriously well talk then well there was no talk she simply gave me the next meal saying that she feared it also had meat in it when i tried to give it back to her she said i could eat the fruit and the zucchinitomato so i left a ten hour flight not only hungry but also will my digestive track acting up i had not eaten meat in about years and my system was reacting to it doing some research online it turns out that japan air offers a vegetarian hindu and a regular hindu but no such distinction was clear to us when we placed our special meals in general though i found the onboard service quite mediocre and will think twice about flying japan airlines again once this whole trip is over the woman who checked us in today onto another japan airlines flight was much more understanding i made an attempt to change todays meals whether she succeeds or not for us the important thing is she made an effort no such effort was made by the prior flight attendants they had a tired and removed attitude to their jobs on a positive note the inflight entertainment was varied and engaging,3
my wife and i have been traveling by japan airlines and certainly enjoy every flight for the excellent skill of the captain and his team landing is just like feather touch down very smooth catering service is a learning of japanese cooking art japanese and western meals are provided for choice however in order to get japanese meal it would be better to contact the airline hours in advance to reserve otherwise you may end up to eat the western food that is not very tasty in flight services are always top quality and attendants are always ready to serve the cabin is spotless clean including toilet that is maintained all the time the only problem is that english language needs improvement as very often it is hard to understand the announcement comfortable enjoyable and always like to travel with this top quality airline,5
the service was exceptional the attendants were very helpful and properly attired in very nice uniforms the food served was very good i would definitely fly this airline whenever i have the chance,5
we never actually took the flight contacting them prior to the flight at their request because their reservation booking codes had changed left us on hold for hours before we were disconnected another minutes and i managed to speak to someone on the day of the flight the flight was cancelled but the email did not come in until we were on the way to the airport when we arrived there there was a sign listing all the flights that were cancelled and to call their customer service department hours later i am still trying to get through for a world class airline the service is the worst i have ever experienced i have managed to book a flight through another airline and i am hoping to get a refund from jal their website is not user friendly and their telephone support is nonexistent,1
my first time take japan airline with my family we very happy with the service from ground staff to flight staff all very good service good job japan airline staff u the best,5
i dislike flying no matter what class this boarding of this flight was interesting in that premium economy passengers got on last this was so they didnt block the passageways of the economy passengers not a bad idea the flight was overnight breakfast had a japanese touch to it as you might expect there was a mug of rich broth with some pasta pickles fruit in separate little bowls a few people including me didnt eat the pasta it looked italian there was no sauce the plane was a boeing those aircraft are quite nice quieter than previous boeing i have flown in the business class seats looked unsatisfactory because they were all in little cells i was glad i wasnt in them if you were travelling with a partner it would have been difficult to converse i never use the in flight entertainment dont even turn it on i bring my own,4
the seats was spacious however the inflight entertainment was not so great movies was mainly in japanese which i think they should catered for foreigners as not all the flight are taken by japanese inflight meals wasnt that great too,3
as my first review flying jal from melbourne to tokyo jal do it again on our return leg back to australia jal really are a sensational airline to fly premium economy is really worth the extra cost it really is great food options again amazingly generous room great seating with full reclining option food service and even little things like the window tinting technology as opposed to the traditional shades as they say do yourself a favour,5
after a slight mess with ticketing once on the plane everything was very comfortable and smooth even in economy there was more legroom than the outward flight on the british airways flight to the uk the seating of is great if you are a couple traveling the plane is a newer plane and so very clean and you dont get the grubby feeling you experience on some older planes the food was actually very good the touch screen was of a good size and very responsive with a wide film selection service was excellent having gotten engaged over the winter period we mentioned it to the staff just during conversation on the plane towards the end of the flight two cabin attendants came over with a model plane and a signed postcard wishing us a happy future a small but very thoughtful touch all in all a very good flight and hours passed relatively quickly,5
this was actually two flights hawaii to tokyo hour stop then on to shanghai makes for a long trip but jal made it bearable the seats and service on both legs were good great quality food served by friendly and courteous staff the change in tokyo was efficient with a good lounge to wait it,4
food is exceptional and airplane is new with lots of feature to choose for tv music games and much more will definitely fly with jal again and again,5
what would you expect from a japanese company or airline in this case no nonsense standard of quality and consistent service thats exactly what they delivered boeing well maintained clean all in order good entertainment system and impeccable service food for inbound to tokyo was ok melbourne supplied but outbound from tokyo was impressive showcasing local chefs variety etc well done jal looking forward to another flight to tokyo hopefully haneda airport this time,5
great service friendly staff nice layflat bed on from tokyo to jkt we flew on the the seats also lie flat but i found the seats on the narrower compare to the which is interesting because they were able to put seats in the middle aisle in the yet the seats are wider the japanese food selection were too exotic for me half of the food on the plate i dont even know what they are business class lounge in lax was very nice breakfast was really good unfortunately the staff were not friendly at all at the lax lounge and they remove breakfast food before they put out lunch and the food selection for lunch was like dorm food overall it was a great experience flying with jal sakura lounge in tokyo was also very nice much nicer than lax lounge overall jal is rated up there with ana and eva air in terms of service food and seats,5
i was lured by business class fare that was about cheaper that its rivals you get what you pay for first off the from vancouver to tokyo did not have full flat bed only old fashioned pod type recliners to make matters worse they ran out of salmon dinner both ways and the only other option was unpalatable for me wine selection was modest they lay over was long hrs but the flight gets in at about pm in japan therefore not much time to go to tokyo and enjoy the city may be an ok flight if you were traveling to vancouver to tokyo and dont mid the seats good option from tokyo to delhi with full flat beds overall not worth it if you are traveling to india,3
we were taking a day cruise departing from singapore on we booked a flight from lax to nrt with a connection to singapore while at lax the captain announced that the flight would be delayed by an hour in order to facilitate a cargo transfer unfortunately they were unable to make up the loss time during the flight so towards the end of the flight a stewardess came to my wife and i and informed us that they were going to hold our connecting flight to singapore flt so that we need not worry when we disembarked in tokyo we observed a display board with the names of approximately a dozen passengers of which our names was amongst them a very polite young female jal employee handed us an envelope she didnt speak fluent english but she was able to communicate to us that there were boarding passes and bus vouchers inside the envelope she further explained that we would need to claim our bags and catch a bus for haneda airport by using our cellphone we found that there was another flight leaving from nrt to singapore in less than hours she then informed us that this flight was already filled we then attempted to explain that the delay of our flight was not the result of a mechanical or weather issue and that it was actually caused by a decision of the airline to wait for delayed cargo it had now been hours since we left las vegas and we were quite exhausted were we now expected to retrieve our bags go thru customs somehow locate where to trade the vouchers for bus tickets then find the correct bus stop wait in line for the bus to load our luggage and wait for the bus to make other stops before arriving at the haneda international terminal we explained to the young lady that we were very tired and that we held executive platinum status with one world and that we were currently traveling in business class we pleaded could you please arrange for a taxi or airport limo to make things easier for us apologetically she said there was nothing she could do to help us at this point we insisted to speak with a manager when the manager arrived he was very polite professional and spoke excellent english he also informed us that he was unable to arrange for private transportation to the haneda airport but that he would personally escort us thru baggage claim and would obtain the bus tickets and show us where to catch the bus this was a huge help and we truly appreciated his efforts just out of curiosity i asked him if we had been flying st class instead of business would they have arranged for private transportation he replied im sorry to say no this is actually very good to know my wife makes several st class trips per year to asia as does her employees there are always going to be occasional issues when taking long trips this fact is entirely unavoidable however it all comes down to how well the issues are handled frankly we believe this situation could have been handled far better than it was it just seems to me that its counterproductive and ultimately selfdefeating for jal to treat their vip travelers in this manner jal made the decision to wait for a late cargo transfer which caused us to miss our connection jal also made the decision not to pay the it would of cost to minimize our inconvenience which was also their fault on the way back we flew on cathay pacific i found their business class to be superior to jal the cathays seats are larger because the rows are as opposed to jal which were cathay also has a significantly larger library of movies and tv shows however the inflight service on both airlines was truly outstanding,2
this was a hr morning flight from singapore to tokyo narita the business section of the aircraft is in the form of configuration is good for easy access and privacy the crew serviced lunch pretty early before am singapore time before dimming the light for passengers who would like to sleep surprisingly slippers disposable were provided for a relatively short day flight light snacks were provided about an hour or so before landing the seats were clean could be flattened completely to sleep the entertaining choices including some japanese and asian movies were adequate overall this was a solid business flight passengers flying business on this flight should note that the jal lounge was not opened before the flight and they have to use a commercially contracted lounge where the coffee was good but not the food,4
japan airlines knows how to make their customers feel valued the plane was new and spotlessly clean everything worked the seats had the the little hygienic paper things on the headrest the pillows were decent and had cloth covers there was more leg room than we have experienced on american flights the flight attendants were well groomed and most respectful and accommodating real cloth towels were provided before meals i did not find the food palatable but that doesnt mean it was bad i just dont have a taste for japanese food jal compares more favorably than aa,5
this flight had the nice sky suite seats i was quite relived when i saw them i was somewhat expecting the old angled seats this was a boeing the service and the seat was great but the food was pretty disappointing i ordered the japanese menu i guess that was a bad idea to order the japanese menu on a flight originating from bangkok i barely ate anything,3
i had a whirlwind threeweek trip to seoul then to jeju island then to busan back to seoul gimpo overnight then from gimpo to haneda haneda back to gimpo then incheon back to honolulu lots of flights lots of time spent in airport lounges i have to say that the business class experience on the japan airlines flight from seoul gimpo to tokyo haneda was amazing excellent service and the food was completely edible which is not something you can say for most flights nowadays even in first class seats i have to add that i think there was only two classes of service on this flightbusiness first and economy my seat was g,5
the level of service with jal is unmatched the attendants come around to get to know you and then address you for the remainder of the fight with respect and kindness the overall flight was comfortable and without issue food was excellent and they give eastern and western options depending on your preference overall excellent flight and service,5
i tried the japanese lunch meal which was lovely each of the wines was served properly and care even the luggage came off by class which is a welcome change a pleasure to fly,5
had a chance to try japan airlines fleet last month a codesharing system with malaysia airlines and it was fantastic starting from great lounge to the food and punctuality i couldnt ask for more loved the seats too seems bigger than air asia or mas moml were okay and ife seems to have a lot of latest movies too its a good hrs flying and cant wait to be board again next time,5
lots of overhead space but i think that also is because few japanese travelers bring carry on food was delicious very impressed,5
lots of overhead space agents extremely helpful english speaking made sure my connections tofrom a usa carrier went smoothly unlike usa agent,5
love the plane its cozy what i found thats lacking is that the ammenities are not enough i have a sensitive skin but they dont provide any moisturizer but overall the food is great and the staff are wonderfull,4
stars for convenience it is nice to be able to leave from san diego without having to go thru lax service is good with helpful and gentle staff members enjoyed the cultural bow to passengers by the staff when arriving to the gate in japan seats not as comfortable or spacious as emirates but better than others good entertainment choices and movies thru the flight have to pay for wifi my party of was interested in upgrading to business class but recent upgrades to their computer systems only gave us a choice to do so at the airport upon checking in their systems were down so it took some time to find out how much more for the upgrade once price was obtained and we were going to proceed with the upgrade we were told if we did there would not be any food for us k per person and no food the staff said they didnt have any extra available for the upgraded seats we stayed in economy and food was just ok so i suggest for you to bring snacks or food for the long flight rice crackers and chocolate offered as snacks japanese beer wine and drinks made up for it but we were starving by the time we arrived at our destination on our way back we were better prepared so we loaded up on snacks and food overall convenience a plus service a plus but food just ok,3
seat is excellent because spacious leg room free wifi throughout the flight free beverages courteous flight attendants,5
flight was fully booked so it took a bit long to board inflight entertainment was really great one of the best i had ever experienced cabin crew was attentive and quick in responding to passengers main meal however was a bit awful to me particularly the icecream more ice than cream more than hours on sky and only meal was served i think it should be,4
from check in on halloween complete with costumed agents to lounge availability for premium economy the experience was wonderful we had booked the flight in february and sometime between them and the end of september my traveling companion and seating had changed and we were no longer sitting together on a two leg flight to bangkok when boarding was about to begin our names were called by the gate agent long story short the agent replaced our premium economy tickets with business class ones we were close to tears and so grateful to have the fourteen hour leg of our flights upgraded our return flights werent upgraded but premium economy was a very good experience too,5
have experienced almost no delays recently food and wines are the best amongst competing airline services between the uk and japan,5
they are on time customer service is amazing and foods are good also the price was quite reasonable after the bankruptcy they really improved the quality of the service,5
flew jfknrtcgk in march and i was very pleased with the whole experience excellent service from check in to onboard service tasty food flights were full but planes had ample legroom more than the average you see in economy class local staff at cgk were not good i am afraid the japanese lady there though was exceptional and went out of her way to accommodate and rebook me would recommend them and of course i would fly them again,4
wasnt sure what to expect when flying to japan with jal for the first time especially with kids however it was a sensation we upgraded to premium economy and i would highly recommend outlaying the extra we got to access in melbourne to the relaxing private lounge jal premium economy give you heaps of leg room generous seating great quality blankets and pillows heaps of food a little toy for the kids and excellent service we had a little complication with our seating and they handled and resolved it superbly for someone like me thats not a great flyer it would have to be the best experience ive had in the air thank you jal,5
we travel a lot and usually fly united or american so we can get membership points our last international flight on united left us with a bad taste as our seats were even smaller and narrower than ever before and the friendly skies didnt seem as friendly as they used to be so when we compared flights to jakarta we found that jal had a direct flight and was comparable in price and we decided to try them what a breath of fresh air to fly jal the attendants were amazing they were friendly and very helpful they even put an improvised vegetarian meal together for us after they found out that we had not eaten anything because we had not ordered a veg meal on time not only that but during the flight they got in touch with jal ground crew and were able to get us a vegetarian meal for our next leg of the flight that is real service the food is so much better than the stuff that the other airlines offer and instead of plastic utensils they use real flatware another thing that makes jal stand out from the two american airlines they keep the toilets clean in flight when we are on an international flight on the other airlines by the time we are half way to our destination the restroom is filthy and smells like an outhouse in contrast jals restrooms are maintained by the flight crew so they are clean throughout the flight we were were very impressed that even in economy we were treated with respect and like human beings thank you jal and your wonderful flight crew,5
one of the best airlines i have traveled on i travel quite often to japan and have taken japan airlines before and the food varies depending on whether you get a japanese meal or a western meal i actually never like their japanese meals so much the standard of japan airlines is high and the service they provide is excellent good entertainment system and they dont just service ice cream they serve haagen dazs check in and departure were very easy as i am very familiar with jakarta airport in fact check in was exceptional as the service was so nice,5
travelled overnight on both legs of the singaporetokyo trip breakfast was unappetising with the main hot dish consisting of only a soggy omelette egg and a sausage on the return flight and some cold side dish one of the criticial issues i encountered was that they changed my preferred seats twice and did not notify via email about the change even though the website stated that they will inform passengers of any change on one of the changes which was due to a change in aircraft from a to a they even separated passengers that had chosen to seat next to each other something which must have been done alogrithmically by backroom staff which showed they lacked service consideration in mind another seat change was made by the airline about weeks before the flight without warning and they rearranged our seating again this time supposedly due to a new reservation system which they were rolling out between november and december had to constantly login to their website to frequently check that our reservation and seats were in order other than that the actual flight was uneventful,3
if you can spring for it prem econ is definitely the way to go first you get to use the lounge services which helps you with relaxing a little especially before a longhaul flight the sakura lounge in nrt is definitely better than the one in hnd the one in nrt has showers massage chairs and even a masseuse food is also pretty good at the lounges seats inflight dont go all the way down but at least it props up the dangling ankles incline is good too not bad for those with back problems food is also good service is always excellent they even celebrated my birthday enroute thank you hk crew was upgraded to business otw back nothing like attentive service and free flowing of food and drinks the flat seat for sleeping definitely helps,4
we have been using jal for our trips to japan and we always get premium economy it makes such huge difference for us with the comfort of seats and other benefits that comes with it the seats are wider softer and it comes with some goodies like slippers toothbrush eye mask and several other items the food and drink options are also better and i do think we get treated better than in regular economy well the food is not excellent but it is airplane food they can do but so much from my experience i prefer their food much better than food served on other nonjapanese airlines like united or american one of the greatest benefit for us is the access to airport lounge i call them the oasis at the airports and it is such a nice way relax and enjoy some complimentary food and drinks while we wait for our flight one negative thing is that their website and mobile app are not user friendly it takes so much time and effort to check in compared to any other airlines that i flew with the app only comes in japanese language and it really is completely useless if you are not using it from japan if you dont reside in japan i with if they can change their website and app design so that it is easier for us travelers to process online check in trips to japan is a long flight and with more comfortable seats we can rest better even thought the seats does not become a flat bed like in business or first class it is still comfortable enough to get some sleep and rest i would continue for fly with jal in premium economy for sure read my full review of their food and drink offerings on my food blog foodlovergirl,4
first time travellers on jal travelled business class for sydney to narita airport japan this is not quite in the same league as emirates or singapore airlines however the cost is less and value for money is better the service is first class and the food is choice of traditional japanese or western style the seats do lie flat but if you a big person this is not for you the movie listing is somewhat limited but is updated at the beginning of each calender month overall we were happy with jal and would definitely use them again,4
we flew jl an overnight flight from narita to sydney the trip was very pleasant we went premium economy were able to sleep with the extra space the checkin process was very organised hasslefree the staff members were very professional friendly the plane was clean the service was excellent the food our last piece of japan was very good for airline food the plane was delayed leaving narita due to the knockon effect of bad weather in other parts of the country it was friday night we were kept up to date with our place on the runway via announcements the plane made up some time on the trip with the help of a tailwind although we arrived only minutes late after landing the captain made an announcement that they were humbly sorry for the delay of minutes i love japan they are so respectful considerate i would definitely fly jal again,5
the cushion seat was hard though it has better leg room no option to choose for meal unlike sq flight taking night flight departing at hrs without toiletries provided such as socks and toothbrush,3
i chose to fly jal from sydney to narita as it was the most direct quickest route i had considered jetstar thro cairns although when i investigated it was more expensive with addons less leg room service etc etc just too hard i had flown jal many years ago at that time it was nothing out of the ordinary in the days when qantas was exceptional the process to book was extremely difficult as it was during the period of the jal major it upgrade i ended up using a rd party for the st time probably last to book the tkts having said that i did phone jal to sort out our seats after the agent had us sitting apart in different rows then gave me the jal ph number after waiting mins the person i spoke to was extremely helpful sorted our seats was very polite patient the plane was clean wellmaintained good leg room good food good inflight entertainment great service we usually fly sia have done so since qantas went downhill however i will look at jal compare for our next trip as i would fly with them again,4
the trip was a delight the cabin staff were very attentive and respectful the seat was like a lounge at home but better the food was different but enjoyable the boarding and disembarkation was not rushed and the ground staff were also attentive to our needs it was a daytime flight but we had time to relax and sleep before our arrival which made the premium economy seat worth the extra money,5
the level of service offered was excellent the seat pitch and width offered in economy was great which is important for me as i am cm and the food is the best ive had on any airline i will be my consider option next time im going to asia or eurpoe,5
leading the way in service flight departures and just great service it was jal who informed us that we arrive tokyo airport and depart from another otherwise we would have lost our way service on board was excellent with such beautiful stewardesses cleanliness is also worth mentioning of course legroom with the seat ahead of you is forward is ok but when back,5
although jals online services are difficult to navigate and often unreliable in terms of booking your ticket seat selection and checkin the flight attendants onboard are sure to impress although the lack of leg room is typical of most flight today the food is plentiful and tasty my overall impression was greatly improved after having the pleasure of being served by a most gracious and attentive onboard staff i will certainly consider jal again but hope they catchup with much needed changes to online services,4
i fly to asia several times a year this time i was offered a round trip on jal for the first time in years jal used to be over the top in amenities before the realities of competition forced them to rethink their business model this flight was efficiency itself from boarding to inflight services i flew business class and the design was was different than i have experienced before on my flight you had what might be called an individual cubical where you could raise or lower a divider between yourself and the next seat over this would be nice if you were traveling with a significant other or a colleague the food was good as was the service a nice feature is that you can order from a set menu throughout the flight the seats fold out flat and i arrived more rested than usual one thing i like is that jal is accommodating on stopping over in japan as part of your flight plan something that can be difficult with other airlines in my experience an added bonus is that japan has to have among the worlds best organized airports getting through immigration and into town is made simple and if you get mixed up there are people to get you to the right service i mean it is really quite pleasant for a change if you have dietary needs let them know well in advance,4
my wife is aa platinum and it was impossible to get seat assignment prior to airport check in on line it was impossible to do it we called jal and was told we could check in online at midnight tokyo time surprise it was not possible we will see what they assign us when we get to the airport tomorrow so much for oneworld stay tuned we will update later,2
the cabin and seat in the jal is in my opinion better than the business class cabin and seat of ba the service is excellent a great choice of meals and the entertainment system is also superior jal offers a anytime to the seat service for meals that can be ordered using the on board electronic tablet slippers are provided to use on the flight all in all i really enjoyed this flight with jal,5
this is written more in sorrow than in anger i was not the traveler my son loved the flight the flight attendants and everything about it it is his nd time on jal this year i however am the unfortunate one who made the reservation the earlier trip this year making the reservation was quick and easy nice helpful people but about november th they instituted a new reservation system let me say i did it all on the phone and perhaps the system works better on line but it was a nightmare the usual wait time on the phone was close to an hour they wouldnt book the flight till they sent me a form to fill out and made sure my credit card was accepted and you didnt even know if you had a ticket or not for the departure from bangkok we never did get a printed confirmation and there was a problem with which day the flight left in all my many many years of airplane travel i have never encountered anything like it conclusion great flight but not worth the trouble to make the reservation,3
highly recommended smooth and quick checkin punctual very small delay must use the word punctual except for the absolute perfectionist good service overall except that the wifi on board doesnt work at least for me the provision of bag covers from the white box in the foreground in photo albeit not useful for me is a demonstration of jals attitude service improvement is a neverending pursuit,5
thought i could survive economy class on the short hop from tokyo to shanghai and i did with emphasis on the word survive the seats are small and legroom extremely limited the plane was packed solid i had a middle of the plane aisle seat and needed every relaxation tool available to avoid claustrophobia the food was forgettable but the seat did have personalized entertainment with both japanese and english language programming crew did their best but i got the feeling that there were not enough lids to cover all of the pots,3
if you want to feel like a god in the sky this flight is for you even my shoes got their own charriot as expected flying first comes with royal class treatment this flight has attention to details not just the wide size of seat and but ability to stretch out was very roomy flight came with a five course meal and kitchen was open anytime up till minutes before landing its top of the line treatment and best way to fly long international flights see pictures highly recommend it,5
that we could move to london via narita flying japan airlines it was only by accident that we came across jal as an option when we were looking to fly another airline to try and use our points and after arguing with other this other airline over something that shouldve been simple we decided to keep searching thanks for the push having seen that it was a reasonable price for of us to be able to fly business class via narita we thought we might give it a whirl admittedly we were moving overseas and the selling point apart from the other good reviews was the offer of a luggage allowance of x kilo suitcases each figuring that all of our belongings could squeeze in to kgs we took the plunge and booked it i have to say we made the right decision whilst the lounge at mel was a little boring we still had access to the qantas lounge so parked ourselves there for a short while the lounge in nrt on the other hand was amazing and we took advantage of it whilst we waited for our next and final flight different airline unfortunately on boarding the flight we were greeted by the staff and took our seats moments later we picked our breakfast choice and were given the option of a polite prod to wake us up gently when it was being served i wish id taken photos of the food because presentation was excellent the service was great and they have the only lie flat seat that i know of that i could stretch out on and im almost the only thing i thought missing was a high armrest but it wasnt really needed all of our very heavy suitcases arrived in perfect condition we dont think that they were dropped or thrown either because there werent any evident scuffs or bumps so id say they care there too all in all we thoroughly enjoyed the flight and cant wait to fly them again,5
flying with jal was the most comfortable hospitable and feeling home with the service they provide i love this airline and will definitely fky them again on my next trip to asia,5
the only downsize was the high temperature on the flight we didnt even use the blanket it was too much on paristokyo but ok for the return otherwise the food is really good and the legroom is better than other company i would have liked to see some japanese drama but no subtitles no roblem with the movies and a good choice,4
i went to tokyo for short business trip at end ocober we go to japan total people we bought the ticket return we go there for visiting tokyo motor show its a nice journey with jal leg room is spacious the food and beverages are very delicious and the staff is very nice and helpfull really enjoy and hopely can fly again with jal,5
the entire experience with jal and their staff was fantastic friendly attentive and the dreamliner was an amazing plane to fly on no shortage of entertainment and economy felt roomy not sure if thats the staggered seating the dreamliner has but at the end of the flight we got off the plane and felt fine,5
first time travelling international with a very hyperactive year old boy checkin was fast make sure that you do the web checkin and print your boarding pass or have it readily in your smartphone or tablet plane itself is okay enough leg room for us we are midsize filipinos food is great for both my husband and i but not so for our year old tip for those who have very picky toddlers bring your own food like for us we bought popeyes and brought it with us in the plane totally worth the carryon then the same thing from manila to the usjollibee entertainment was awesome lots of new movies the only thing that i can suggest is maybe more english speakers for the flight attendants other than that overall we enjoyed flying with jal and will fly again with them,4
we always fly jal when we can equally avoiding us legacy carriers on international flights when we can the biggest reason the sakura lounge at nrt which has the best curry and dumplings anywhere effectively a preflight dinner fit for royalty delicious and fabulous and what do they serve at aas nrt lounge peanuts thats right peanuts,5
fast efficient check in at the counters from manila to narita then from narita to new chitose and vice versa competent very cordial staff comfortable seats and im in economy great flight attendants and good food,5
thee attendants were very polite always smiling and very efficient even when we went through severe turbulence their demeanour meant that all of the passengers were calm and nobody seemed to be panicked they also looked after my friend who has ms very well escorting him to the toilet and back to his seat with no fuss also better legroom than ba flights on matching aircraft the food was also great,5
a businessclass in the normal range not espescially good but neither bad friendly service nothing special at all,3
i have flown many times with jal i have never been disappointed from checkin to arrival and through baggage claim the staff are attentive helpful and courteous i have been in economy premium economy and business class the staff are always the same no matter which class i traveled there were many little extras such as the provision of toiletries eye masks ear plugs etc the toilet areas are cleaned regularly there is a choice of either japanese or western food all beautifully presented and delicious there is added comfort in the seating with the provision of a pillow and blanket for economy and premium economy business class has semi private pod with fully reclining seat and large pillow and blanket loose fitting jacket and trousers for sleeping are available it also has a larger tv screen when traveling business or first class the qantas lounge was available in sydney and jal lounge in tokyo,5
one arrival to nrt went to business class check in counter the counter was not busy and plenty of counter available i tried to go the counter directly but stopped a female ground crew she seemed to be checking the air ticket of a pair customers she just told me to line up in an unfriendly manner when i return to line up at the back then i saw a man spoke with another male crew in japanese without any checking procedure and directly went to check in then i told the male crew about my destination and flying class he allowed me to go the check in counter i felt frustrated and disappointed about the airline for unequal treatment for customers it seems that jal to become a star airline should consider the issue generally all other crews were polite and professional the flight was operated by boeing the jal sky suite was contemporary spacious stateoftheart controller and a large tv mon the entertainment program with plenty of international selections the food and beverage was good as well thought they did not served in separate courses you can be selected wide variety of beverage including choices of sake all fa were polite and professional,4
most comfortable return flight we have experienced from europe access to air france lounge and showers at cdg and similar access at narita to jal lounge the clincher was that all sectors were in boeing dreamliners excellent pressurisation meant you arrived almost feeling refreshed only minor gripe was that movies were well past use by date will certainly fly with jal again,5
jal recently introduced new type of economy class seats i wasnt aware that jl was equipped with the new seats i was prepared to endure hours flight i am cm tall as soon as i took a seat i realised a difference i could cross my legs comfortably this new seats worth extra cost if you are taking long haul also foods are good as always punctuality is second to none,5
the crew members were really helpful as we was travelling with young children got opportunity to board first it was so relaxing our kids enjoyed on board service a they got choose the orders,5
direct flight very comfortable service good entertainment good food enjoyable i would recommend if looking for direct flight to japan,4
jal now has a flight from tokyo to san diego using a dreamliner this flight often has rewards miles seats available the service on jal is one of the best in the world they constantly clean the lavatories the food is good snacks and drinks are always available and the legroom in economy is almost as good as business class on other airlines,5
great flight and great airline the space between my row and the front one was very big very nice entertainment food and cabin crew,5
i am impressed with the ground check in service of jal the service personnel stands behind their counter and they would come out all the way to your queue point to usher your as their guest the lady is very polite and organized by reaffirming with you number of luggages and other checked in items they would opened up more counters if there is long queue all in all we are being served within ten to fifteen minutes the security and immigration check point was also seamless,4
they were very helpful with wheelchair assistance when changing airlines in tokyo to their codeshare partner american airlines in general it was a good experience,4
top notch services and comfortable seats the best flight attendants ever on the thousand of flight i have flown,5
we are frequent travellers all over the world and found japan airlines which we flew for the first time very comfortable very good service and especially the food japan airlines has invited finalists of the red chefs competition to develop good cuisine for the economy class and some dishes by two of those we could enjoy on this flight flight food does mostly not taste too much but this was delicious the time schedule was well kept,5
cas omotenashi was so good but dishes were not so good the equipment in the airplane was nice the flight time was punctual i felt good totally,4
easy flight but prebook some accommodation for arrival as this flight arrives when the melbourne domestic terminal is closed,5
as always jal offers me feeling as if i was in my home full of smile in cabin and felt warm hospitability all the time i took jals code share flight operated by american it was not so happy for example meal servisse was something as if they feed for animals,5
what a great experience the service was fantastic and it started from the check in desk all the way to the lounge in tokyo for the connecting flight the midnight departure from melbourne means a good sleep on the plane and waking up on approach to tokyo hopefully the food was fantastic both japanese and western menus i was so impressed i joined the frequent flyer program i will fly with them again for sure there is something about the japanese service just first class no matter where you are sitting the dreamliner was great the plane was clean and the seats were fantastic in premium economy well worth the extra cost as it also includes lounge access,5
excellent services from checking in boarding at gate and enjoying a pleasant flight the sakura lounge is also great it offers a wide variety of food pastry and beverages alcohol and nonalcohol im impressed the flight itself is good cabin crew are very friendly courteous helpful and really pay attention to passengers requests the seat is private and comfortable though i wish it could be a real degree reclining seat but thats ok it has a decent amount of leg room inflight entertainment is worth also mentioning they are superbly categorised and well organised you cant get bored while flying the headphones are decent with noise cancelling alternative the cabin is on par with typical japanese standards super clean and well maintained the food on this flight is awesome given the late night departure i love the way the airline communicate with passengers about the meal options cabin crew would ask you to choose your breakfast japanese or western style or you could write it down in a form they provided if you follow this option they would politely wake you up when its time and serve you the meal of your choice to sum it up im impressed by services provided by japan airlines i have few things to complain about whats not to love,5
the thing i liked most about jal is the extra space you get in economy wider seats and more legroom than any other economy seat i have been on the crew were so very friendly and attentive and were still smiling at the end of a hour flight the plane was modern and spotless clean great range of movies and entertainment on a large touch screen only thing i was not keen on was the food but that was probably just a personal taste thing totally recommend jal,5
hadnt flown jal for many years so it was interesting to reacquaint myself with this airline it was also our first flight on the boeing dreamliner that jal had in service for a number of years we werent quite sure about economy class but neednt have worried as there was plenty of leg room and even though we were against a bulkhead we could recline comfortably the service was very good and the food i thought the best i had been served in economy in quite some time overall a very good and comfortable experience i would recommend to anyone,5
the us flights from and to narita have been to a high standard until the latest flight from san diego to narita they have reverted to a lower cost amenities pack and reduced significantly the food quality in businessthis is clearly driven by cost reduction but they missed the real opportunity to streamline their boarding and checkin with contract rather than jal staff a total of ten is excessive to board an aircraft and only one flight a daybusiness class should be lucrative but cutting costs will turn people away,3
it is a nice trip from yamagata to nagoya and vice versa i could enjoy the trip and the beautiful scenery viewed through the window of the airplane cabin attendants behavior is also comfortable for me the crews technical average is in high standard and well acceptable you could choose this airlines with safety and relaxation,5
as expected japanese always have high standard of service it is very comfortable and food are great,5
the economy seats were excellent value for the money the difference between economy and premium is not worth the extra money leg room was ample entertainment good the food vegetarian absolutely terrible but you cant have everything the service was very good and we left and arrived on time in both directions the route is provided by a boeing which is quiet and comfortable the experience was so good we have booked to go again in april with jal,4
excellent flight on time as you can expect from the japanese efficient and friendly service would love to travel more with jal to japan from kl but they dont have direct flight unfortunately,5
i was on board flight jl last november it was a good flight the seat i was in was comfy enough the entertainment was upto date and recent movies were in the selection the food and the service was totally good,4
the seats were very comfortable with more than enough leg room the stewardesses always greet you with a smile while attending to your needs pleasantly surprised by the service and the comfort these are the two things that stands out for me will try to fly jal if i fly to japan again,5
was offered the chance to upgrade the sydneynarita leg of the outbound trip for well worth the expense the premium economy seats are like business class seats of a few years ago and are extremely comfortable enhanced ife leather sound noise cancelling headphones and more food choices made the leg excellent for just under hours the extra expense was worth it,5
it was a short flight as short as minutes but flight attendants are always helpful and nice to us,4
the service was very nice however the business class space is not for the big tall guy others were very nice the lavatory is super clean no funny smell at all,4
great airline with great service good seating good food good service and i have had return flights and always consistent,5
japan airlines is one of the best airlines in terms of services crew were polite and very approachable seats were comfortable and have good legroom space food was also good for brunch and much more for dinner the red u which were collaborated with young chef finalists inflight movies were up to date too we had smooth flight and jal is ontime,4
i usually fly business class any time the flight is over hours and so i was a bit disappointed that the convention provide me with premium economy and was i surprised the seats were comfortable and came with a foot rest the food was quite nice and the service excellent,5
while i havent flown japan airlines in years the flight times for a meeting in tokyo offered the opportunity to fly with jal for a late nighttime early morning am flight the service was remarkable the incredibly polite staff made certain everyone felt comfortable i was impressed with the service both on and off the plane i would highly recommend jal and plan to use again for another meeting next year,4
the seats were comfortable and floor space was generous seats only beside window the service was extremely friendly however the flight attendant did not speak english either flight as my seat was last row the back of seat could not recline on return to sydney i noted a passengers seat moved forward and back automatically reclined bathrooms very clean my veganvegetarian food option fine i would fly jal again but fly economy as i noted they had very generous leg room and the functionality of the seats was the same as premium economy i flew october just over a year ago,4
seat configuration with decent seats with good recline comfortable for a hour flight with a snooze good media programmes and decent sized screen very good headphones reasonable food same a starter economy with excellent service on time,4
i used to have a feeling that the service at jal is square and rather cold while it is true that they are sufficiently polite however the group of cas this time was suitably casual and i could enjoy my flight back to tokyo in a cozy atmosphere the ageexperience mix of the staff was also appropriate i saw,5
first time flying with japan airline my husband and i can feel beautiful japanese culture we chose roundtrip business class flight bangkok kansai airport after checkingin at suvarnabhumi airport we got a premium lane to go thrugh security checked and immigration formality we had visited miracle lounge and sakura lounge there were lots of foods and drinks staffs were helpful and polite i think its a japanese standard that i heard before the really touching japanese culture it was happened after boarding cabin crews were very polite nice smily and excellent service i tried japanese alcoholic drinking i didnt remember the name and japanese breakfast thats great im very impressive the boeing dreamliner business class seat was angleflat seat so sometimes i slided down for sakura lounge at kansai airport it had relaxing quiet zone but less choices of food no toilets in lounge area we had to use toilets in gate area instead i think it was under renovated,4
having flown premium economy with a number of airlines i would have to say that the jal flights have in all respects been the best to date priority check in use of the business class lounge service and comefort were excellent rather than those tilt back seats the aircrafts seats moved forward and back within its ridgid shell an excellent feature the whole experience was fairly close to the old style business class i just booked my next long haul flight with them,5
recently flew with jal on a business trip to japan the service the airline offers is really high quality good food selection between japanese or western meals flight attendants are very quick to respond to your requirements be it a drink or snack,5
nice and great flying with jal seat distance not so close legroom food combination nice and flight attendants helpful,4
we received an upgrade on the flight to tokyo which was a great surprise the service was very very good the return flight was premium economy not as good as business class of course but still pretty darn good first time flying with jal no complaints at all,4
this is my first time flying with jal and it is a great experince the service is very good they are very friendly and helpful the food is good but we just have one choice of meal i will fly again with jal someday,5
since filing for bankruptcy and recovering i think this airline has done a great job of improving customer satisfaction by providing the firstrate service their crew is excellent friendly and efficient their flights are mostly on time i do hope they keep up their effort even after the memories of hard times fade,4
it was a night flight staff was attentive and kept walking the aisle to check on the passengers food was japanese and ok for me,4
we enjoyed our trip and felt no stress over the travel around eight hours from honolulu to narita we got the rest in cozy jal rounge and enjoyed japanese foods and beer when got in the cabin leg space was wide enough where we enjoyed the video entertainments and good sleep for eight hours flight,5
i used miles to upgrade to business class because i had two long haul flights from san francisco to bangkok while the seating area was roomy it did not compare to other business class flights the food was good but trying to sleep was a chore the seat wasnt comfortable and i couldnt get in a proper position even though the seat reclined my initial flight from san francisco was much better but also lacking especially the airline lounge i flew korean air on the return and it was a much nicer event,2
on my way back from a trip of south east asia i flew back from tokyo to dallas in coach i chose to fly on japan airlines instead of aa both have a non stop flights on that route picked japan because of two reasons they fly a instead of a the other reason was my expectations of a much better food experience i was terribly disappointed by the food and the whole meal service neither the asian food selection or the western food offered were desirable at allthis also applied to the beverages offered i did not eat anything they offered i ate anything over the hour flight except what i had in my backpack this reminded me the lack of any food on the us domestic airlines if it was not for the airplane i would have give jl an even lower rating very disappointed,3
the staff at checkin was very friendly the staff was almost ready to let passengers to board the airplane the announcement came out that the flight was delayed due to air control at shanghai pudong airport very quickly staff arranged food voucher for passengers to buy food from designated shops restaurants for lunch after hours delay the flight was okay nothing special i fell asleep as soon as i sat in my seat when i woke up i saw a note in front of me explaining food has been served and they did not want to disturb me this was appreciated comparing with some other airlines maybe because it is economy class i felt the choice of entertainment especially tv drama series are limited,3
it was my first time flying jal i heard good things about jal and was expecting the high quality service my expectations were met the crew and staff were very courteous and helpful i had to transfer in tokyo and i mentioned that to a staff at the counter in nyc when i landed in tokyo an airport staff was waiting for me to help me with the transfer i had to go through customs get my luggage and then reregister for a domestic flightall within hour the food was nice and seats comfortable i saw the crew leaving notes for passengers who were sleeping during the food service in case they want to eat later a practice apparently common for jal and ana but something ive never seen on any other airlines in us britain spain france considering that flight from ny is hours the comfort of seats and service were very important overall recommend,5
the service on japan airline makes you feel so warm and comfortable that in the future i would like to use jal as often as possible,5
we travel to indonesia for a couple of months every year we started with jal several years ago they are terrific right up there with cathay and singapore airlines the flight time from boston to tokyothe first segment is hours they use s which are terrific air planes they comfortable from front to back way more leg room in coach then any other airline we have flown emirates united singapore cathay american southwest garuda indonesia lion air from tokyo to jakarta is about hoursthe food great along with the service by the cabin crew and their attention to detail and to peoples needs they are and have been consistently less money wise than the other comparable carriers from several hundred to sometimes near a thousand less we have booked them them the last three trip to indonesia all very good and on time they are worth a look,5
excellent in flight services departure n arrival on time checkin counter very efficient seat was very comfortable,5
admittedly we used american airlines points for this trip and are we ever glad we did we got first class domestic seats and jal business layflat seats internationally no first class on jal flights so we got to use jals excellent hospitality lounges in dallas tokyo osaka our departure airport and los angeles best onboard service ive experience in years of airline travel very gracious flight attendants tvs and unlimited japanese cuisine during the flight ordered online from our seats everything was on time with gracious presentation on the ground and in the air the only way to travel i highly recommend using jal whenever you can and especially the layflat seatsbeds,5
just returned from bkk flying jal both the outbound flights were a jfktokyo and a tokyo to bkk the was older and showed wear however i had a window sky suite seat which was very private with the divider up and the was much newer without the privacy but still lay flat seats it is the service on jal that was impeccable both flights were on time with boarding done in an orderly fashion and included bowing from the gate agents as we entered the jetway the politeness and eye contact of every employee was impressive the prepared meals were good although a bit too sophisticated for my tastes with a salmon salad and amuse bouche but the quality of the steak and flavor of the sauces was superior there was also an anytime menu with a few options the seats are comfortable and the inflight entertainment system had plenty of options the lavatories while small contained mouthwash and toothbrushtoothpaste get them while they last all business class passengers receive an amenity kit which was adequate but not stellar slippers and wireless headphones apparently there were mattresses that could be placed on seats to make them feel like beds in the overhead bins however i was not aware of them until my return flight all in all this is a great product and what distinguishes it is the service and attentiveness of the staff the price of the ticket was lower than the carriers i priced cathay qatar and i liked the connection through tokyo how many times have you seen ground staff line up and bow toward the aircraft during pushback,4
just a nice airline who keeps their aircraft spotless typically polite japanese crew wonderful legroom food good and even entertainment screens even at the airport they couldnt do enough to help what a shame about comparing them to qantas which we flew from singapore to perth in there was nothing to compare the first half to the second qantas suggest you send some of your board members and crew to experience a legacy airline who does it right you dont need to squeeze folk into your seats you dont need to throw a cardboard box at your paying customers i didnt even experience that on us airlines truly an australian tradition food in takeaway containers well done jal ill fly you again happily,4
non stop service on boeing very comfortable even when flying economy absolutely the best way to fly from san diego to narita,5
jal not a bad experience except its warm on the flight why dont they shoot in some outside air or whatever it is they do to cool the interior not the first flight with them so its not an outlier prior flights were warm also i guess its better than having to wrap up head to toe butso to get some fresh air midway through the flight i went to the bathroom and at least the vent in there is blowing out some air also the flight crew station area seemed to provide a little relief i guess the one good thing was we flew way up passed midway which was pretty cool to see also flew right by mt fuji as close as one can get i guess that was a pretty awesome sight to see check in at hnl a little long but thats almost everywhere other than that it was ok just cool the jets,3
this was one of the smoothest and most comfortable flights i flew between japan and chicago my flight from chubu international airport to narita was cancelled in the morning luckily i was at the airport before am for my am jal flight to narita the ground staff switched me to an ana flight and i could board jl for chicago right on time the flight attendants were all very nice and attentive they have class elegance and good manners as well as respect for their passengers who keep them employed i enjoyed both the dinner and breakfast which was gyudon made by yoshinoya the gyudon was quite a surprise and it tasted really good in the cabin where the air is circulated and very dry a cabin attendance came to my seat and she apologized about the cancellation of my flight from chubu to narita earlier that day she said she wanted to make sure that everything else went fine with my transfer at narita it was very nice of her to do that i enjoyed watching a few movies and listening to music on board overall i enjoyed flying with japan airlines again,5
both on the ground and in the air jal service was excellent check in both on the la side and the osaka side was brief and efficient i was not able to check on line for the return part of the trip due to computer software conversion in the us the check in at kix went very smoothly the staff were uniformly friendly and helpful the lounge access at lax was also very good the seat is not quite as tony as the dreamliner but was comfortable both sitting and flat the quality of food available both western and japanese was very good for an airline coming back on there was a special wine the just released beaujolais nouveau i very much like the dimming mechanism of the windows,4
this was my first time flying in probably about years im glad i picked jal to fly with the flight attendants were all very pleasant and helpful and the flight itself was comfortable for such a long flight the legroom was far better than i had hoped for and the food was always good jal feeds you often too which i wasnt expecting so for anyone contemplating flying with them know youll be in good hands,5
this was our first international flight experience with jal and was based on the best business class fare for the period that my wife and i were going to japan on business and pleasure it turned out to be one of best business class international flight experiences in the past years flight was on time seating was very comfortable and folded flat for sleeping attendants were great and food and drink service was excellent we returned on jal with the same results will definitively strongly consider them for our next flight to asia,5
the flight is nonstop from narita to san diego service is quite good food given that it is on a airplane is quite good food service in addition to regular meals is available most of the flight seats almost but not quite fully recline i recognize this is not the cheapest way to fly but for petes sake why cant american airlines figure out that some people will pay for more than being shoved into an aluminium tube like sausage into a casing us airlines feature only the lowest common denominator of service jal still does it right,5
we used this airline for our trip to and from vietnam we flew on american airlines until we changed planes in dallasfort worth it was all arranged thru japan airlines japan airlines treated us as first class passengers their flights were always on time every employee was very polite we really appreciated the free toothbrushes and warm towelettes we will always use this airline whenever we can,5
service was exceptional from checkin boarding and during the long flight the meals western or japanese were good and food and drink was available during the entire flight we were disappointed that the business class seats had absolutely no more privacy than the economy section there was no separation between seats or the rest of the cabin the seats didnt recline flat and made it more difficult to sleep the recliner position caused me to constantly slide forward as the seat material was slick the headphones provided were not noisecancelling or provided very little as it was difficult to clearly hear movie entertainment also cabin announcements could not be understood at all due to the engine noise in hindsight we should have saved a lot of money and flown economy,3
flew japan airline from chicago to tokyo and osaka to los angeles november and th we were very impressed by the fight captain s skill that made flights very smooth the crew were very courteous and helpful especially the flight from chicago to tokyo the meal were very good making note of the passengers who slept through the meal and making sure bring food later when they wake up definitely will fly the air line again in near future,5
great flight awesome service flight attendants are very attentive to the passengers needs i have flown other airlines and none have been as good as jal airlines i would highly recommend this airline to anyone traveling to narita japan,5
the best thing about jal is the service first of all unlike a lot of other airlines they really take the spirit of honoring oneworld status i have status on american check in was easy and we were able to get our seats changed to sit together the flight was comfortable with decent food never expect great food in economy on any airline and a lot of good entertainment options in terms of a movie selection what really set these guys apart was on the way back i didnt realize that i needed an eta electronic travel authorization to fly back into canada its a form that you fill out that normally gets approved within hours note non us passport holders now need this while flying to canada the staff at jal went into a helpful overdrive showing me how to get to the website and apply and then bringing chairs etc for us to wait while it got approved and the supervisor came in and called some special number that airlines have to contact canadian immigration to accelerate the approval this is the most polite and helpful ground staff and flight staff i have ever seen across any airline definitely added them as an option for me anytime i fly to asia heads and shoulders above the service you get on any domestic north american airline,5
japan airlines takes care of its passengers from check in to landing in the chaotic lax with many rude airport staff japan airlines made sure the check in process in quick painless organized due to their own staff organizing the process in kix we are able to check in our luggage several hours before flight time and spend the rest of the time further exploring and shopping in the airport the food is much better than other airlines and their flight attendants are much more professional,5
we flew from fukuoka airport to yakushima island for our week hiking trip the counter staff was very nice and helpful in checking us in the exceptional thing was only after we landed in yakushima collected our luggage did we find a nice note clipped to our luggage tag see picture attached exceptional experience with a nice warm and friendly touch,5
our second business class flight with this airline and they do an excellent job if we are flying overseas we do not take any us airlines as their service has been deplorable in comparison,5
superb service extremely polite staffgood food by far the level of service was the finest we have ever experienced,5
japan airlines flight from bangkok to tokyo on their dreamliner was one of the best economy flights i have ever been on everyone on board truly took care of you with such grace and kindness the plane was beautiful and comfortable and the food was very good i loved the teriyaki burger for breakfast very yummy i was definitely taken care of on this route thanks,5
the seating was very comfortable the service was great and the selection of entertainment was good,5
japan airlines is the best they cater to your every need the food is excellent and abundant the only thing was the seat on this flight it reclined to a flat position while it tilted down so much you would slide down the seat very uncomfortable i just put my seat up and curled and a slept upright,4
jal have a partnership with delta airlines and i booked on this airline since they booked my luggage all the way to austin however food and comfort level did not come up to expectations menu had limited choice of warm food,3
i actually loved the experience of flying this was my first experience with jal and it was comfortable and enjoyable the crew was as expected excellent and attentive the airplane was new clean and comfortable the kind with electronic shading of windowsimportant on a hour flight video equipment was easy to use and informative particularly the flight information and mapping food was fine and extra snacks were available and abundant legroom was fine for the class of seat if i go to japan again this was my th trip i will definitely seek out jal availability,5
as expected service was outstanding very courteous professional flight attendants always catering to every need of its passengers comfortable seats good inflight meal very clean cabin,5
jal is obviously one of the best airline on the world the service is totally satisfied both in check in and boarding and they always took care each of passengers best flight ive had,5
we were excited about our flight to japan with jal as we recall the wonderful experience some years ago best service food meals and snacks refreshmentsjust the whole experience what a disappointment when we were served tv dinner like meals both flights going and returning home both meals were western type meals the first being a tomato based pork dish served with rice veggie salad yogurt etc it was not appetizing red and white wines were good beer and sake too but not like how i remembered with a refreshment service cart being strolled down the aisle return trip meal was a hamburger wegg rice etc i took a tiny bite of the hamburgeryahk salad was just lettuce with tiny slivers of bell peppers yogurt was warm but i enjoyed the sweet roll after dinner snack was good cupcake with nuts water in a nice pouch,3
wow very comfortable product the window seat is the best option with jal business class sky suites i sat in a it was at the back of business class with windows i used the premium economy bathroom for convenience it was clean and just a little smaller than business but only feet away the only caveat about a window seat is that if you are a larger person the little alley to get to your seat is quite narrow that is the only negative i have to say about this airline product the service was impeccable the food delicious the seatbed was wide long and comfortable the tv huge the partition screen moved up completely and provided me total privacy jal has the superior product across the pacific in business class,5
they are really nice and amazing hospitality they really want you to feel as comfortable as possible best flight ive had,5
short flight from seoul icn to tokyo nrt the staffs were nice and polite the plane has good legs room there was inflight complimentary food and drinks,4
my wife and i took the domestic flight from osaka itami airport to tokyo haneda airport we booked and paid a few months in advance to get cheaper air fares it was cheaper and faster to fly than to catch the train the flight was full which meant that plenty of other passengers thought the same,4
flying business class across the pacific ocean is a big deal to myself as it doesnt happen often i had booked my flight from lax to osaka with business class and unfortunately i had done all my research assuming that jal had the same kind of seat in their lax to osaka run as lax to tokyo sky suites definitely not the case which had me somewhat wishing i had just booked lax to tokyo the shell flat neo seats do not lay flat they are at a downward angle so you slowly slide out of your seat and it just feels odd the shell flat neo seats are also not as comfortable as the sky suites on lots of other jal flights you also will not have as much privacy with shell flat neo seats as they are much more open i had a middle seat which in this case unless you know the person next to you is better than a window seat simply because if the person is sleeping or relaxing in the aisle seat and you have the window and you cannot get out of your seat without asking them to situp or reposition their bed every time you wish to use the restroom or move a bit not great still far better than coach of course but not a great choice by jal to put these in one other note about comfort and i had read this before about jal flights the cabin is kept extremely warm for westerners so be ready as for the service and food the service was great i will not say excellent because my travel companion and i many times felt like we were a bit overlooked vs japanese passengers likely just because of our lack of speaking japanese so they tended to get more service but extremely friendly service and helpful whenever they could be finally the food as i skipped most of the japanese meals since i do not love eel and other delicacies was not bad as i choose a western meal in this case steak the steak on the way to osaka was wonderful but that is about all i cared for if you are a foodie that likes fancy food then this menu is for you if you are more simple in your taste well best of luck given that i went on other jal flights after this all business class if its a choice i would go lax to nrt just to get the more comfortable seats and privacy,3
one the best experience in flight even though it was economy class the flight crew never stop treating the passenger any less i have no words to describe my experience best customer service ever in flight both way to and from i was one happy customer and when i fly to japan next time chances i would choose jal over any other airline,5
today my husband and i flew back to vancouver by japan airlines during the eight hour flight they served us two meals dinner and breakfast the dinner was designed by six red seal chefs and showed something creative and different we completed the full meal the breakfast was a japanese gyuudon meat and rice package by a famous chain restaurant yoshinoya i brought it home to share this comic like meal with our kid better than the good food service was the attentiveness of a flight attendant my husband by mistake left his i pad under his seat the professional and friendly ms inoue brought it to us personally while we were picking up our checkedin luggage i was awed by her service way beyond her duty it would not have happened if we had flown with any other airlines i possibly flew with airlines in the past but japan airlines service quality is incomparable,5
the whole flying experience with jal was great the staff were friendly courtious the planes were well kept clean tidy the meals were of a good quality best of all check in at narita was as soon as we arrived at the airport early off a cruise we didnt have to wait the desk was manned and our luggage was processed straight away,4
japan airlines is the one of nicely customer service by its ground and flight crews the flight crew is very good to its passengers unlike other us and european based airline the japanese culture is ingrained into its daily routine which is extended to all passengers food is also very good,5
i was flying on monday and returning thursday this week when checking in i handed my oneworld card and i was upgraded without asking the whole travel experience began when a young man meet me before i checked in and ended when i arrived back in shanghai this is service quality at its very best,5
travelled in their b back to sin flight was delayed for mins due to busy runaway at narita gate was located at the other end of the terminal hence a min walk after passing immigration meals were beautifully presented especially the potato salad of the adult meal leg room was good the best in y class younger daughter was given a child gift air con of this flight sector was warm i was given a ice pack to cool myself after the cabin crew saw me fanning myself in the midst of the flight cabin crew unable to regulate the temperature of the flight senior cabin crew walked through cabin and thanked all for choosing jal towards the end of the flight,5
from the check in to boarding was well arranged and timed the gate staff was very courteous and accommodating the cabin was clean and crew attended to all our needs,4
this was a charter jal flight to bangkok and tokyo but we stopped for passengers in cairo jeddah kuwait to refuel and karachi took forever and since we were on a low cost tour excursion we couldnt say much this was quite awhile ago while i was stationed on crete we actually started in chania the night before jal is a great airline with friendly and efficient staff and crew,5
from boarding to arrival it was excellent the service was always with a smile the cabin crew were very nice and polite the food was a little bit disappointing but ok great flat bed seats and entertainment system see you soon hopefully,5
travelled from itm to nrt in their b this pm unable to upgrade to their j class as flight was full many international passengers today foc wifi available mins after departure air vents and inflight map were available in this one hr flight one round of drinks were made toilets were clean legroom was good recline was minimal a comfortable flight compared to budget airlines in asia,5
always excellent service dedicated to the comfort of the passenger the lounge in tokyo is also excellent with food drinks computer stations etc at the passengers beck and call,5
we were on cheap tickets at the back of a crowded flight not usually my favorite spot however as a tall man i appreciate leg room and seat width jal had both the attendants were a mix of thai and japanese were attentive and courteous it was a night flight so food was minimal still it left on time and arrived okthat was the main thing,5
little did i know that i was being upgraded on the dreamliner from narita to jakarta japan airlines has to be one of asias best from the aircraft to the flight attendants this was a great experience the customer service level is really really good it was an hour flight after a hour flight from dfw so having a comfortable seat on the final leg of the trip was great i will certainly look to fly jal again soon,5
very nice airlines great food nice staff smooth boarding it was a short flight and everything went well,5
first experience in traveling in e on jl cabin crew made one round of drinks in this one hr flight cabin crew did not enforce to open window shades for this sector many window shades were closed due to sunny weather y class seats were comfortable,5
jal step up their service and the quality of the food service on the tokyo san diego rioute which is more competitive than some others such as the flights to australia the aircraft was a spotless boeing and the service as expected from jal the flight was over quite late departing with no explanation which was a negative,4
japan airlines has recently introduced a direct flight from melbourne to tokyo which is positive in most regards as it avoids the stop over in sydney it is a smart move as it will bring japanese tourists to melbourne but the issue is the timing of the flight from melbourne it leaves at am which is not a good time it also arrives into melbourne late in the evening also inconvenient the flight was a boeing and comfortable and the service is whay you expect on jal food service at night was zero as everyone slept,3
we started our vacation from jfk and flew to tokyo after three hour of layover we flew to singapore service was excellent seats were comfortable air hostesses were very pleasant courteous and helpful all this made the long journey not so tiresome i highly recommend this airline,5
unable to check in bags all the way to itm we managed to cut q as its the peak time at nrt airport at pm check in at the domestic counter at the arrival hall was a breeze jal managed to check in all bags and the upgrades within mins only one small shop selling food stuff newspapers near to the gate charging points available j class seats were extremely comfortable ptv and charging points were available at each seats cabin crew made one round of drinks in the one hr flight it wa worth the yen upgrade,5
travelled in their refurbished y class in their bit was capacity seat was comfortable with best seat pitch in y class ptv with usb ports were available in each seat seat had several pockets to hold small items electrical ports were available for every seats meals were served hrs into the flight with icecream metal cutlery provided light meal was provided hrs before arrival flight arrived mins after scheduled arrival time due to heavy traffic at changi airport it was the best y class i have travelled no wonder jal is one of the best y class in the world just wondering why jal is not a star airline like cx sq,5
jal is the best airline that i have flown with recently the staff are freindly and helpful with a very pleasant manner the aircraft has the best economy seats with plenty of leg room even if the person in the front reclines their seat it does not impact on you if you have the chance to fly jal take it,5
boeing business class accommodations excellent spacious comfortable with incredible toilets service friendly and attentive food selections seemed repetitive and a bit tired more humdrum than spectacular when i want a special meal though its not inside an airplane,4
flew their red eye flight on b as part of my connecting flight from toronto to hong kong boarding was on time and we were bused to the aircraft and used air stair to board the flight even though the aircraft had old style interior it was immaculately clean and well maintained leg room was pretty decent and i had the whole row to myself for this relatively long flight cabin crews were all pretty friendly and polite they served one hot meal and some snacks along the way landed in hong kong about minutes ahead of the schedule all in all you just cant seem to go wrong with all japanese carriers they are top notch in terms of safety comfort and quality of cabin crews,5
premium economy is an excellent value on japan air lines prior to the flight i was provided access to the sakura lounge at narita a large and comfortable waiting area with massage chairs and showers available prior to flight there are some light snacks and a meals available on the upper level as well a good start to a long day i had a bulkhead seat which offered spacious legroom search for this option on seatguru when booking while the seats do not lie flat there is a decent enough recline with footrest that will enable you to get some need shuteye the is the way to go on long haul flights with better air quality and dimming windows i ordered a kosher meal for the flight which was ok but there are snacks soft drinks and tea available throughout the flight bathrooms were clean and service was generally very good the only weaknesses were the inflight entertianment and wifi the inflight entertainment is a little thin on interesting material in english better to download and bring your own wifi service is spotty on the flight over it did not work north of the arctic circle overall excellent service and a very comfortable plane the price difference between premium economy and business class is significant but you are mostly paying for the lie flat seats this makes premium economy and good value,5
i am very disappointed that jal offers such generous baggage allowance of kgs but insists on a size limit for skis i have cross country skis which ways kgs for two pairs but jal charges each way for oversized bags jetstar is horrible to fly with as you feel like a stingy mongrel and here is now no price benefit with flying with them as jal and qantas are now as cheap but offering a full service jal are shooting themselves in the foot by not aggregating the total size as they do with weight i was told it would cost us each way for my skis i can buy a pair for that very excellent otherwise but this is a stupid policy and will put many skiers off using jal this will put many australian skiers off travelling to japan to ski on their air line,4
flew from shanghai to narita then again from haneda to shanghai days apart in october the first trip from pvg to nrt was pretty good used the lounge in shanghai which was ok but nothing special and shared with other airlines service onboard was good and seat was ok for the two hour flight good entertainment the flight back from haneda to shanghai was much better starting with the lounge in haneda which was amazing great food and drink selections and nice views of the planes out of the window the seat on board was much bigger than on the way out and the service was great food onboard was good and great inflight entertainment,4
lie flat seats are the way to go we used to fly coach when we were younger then the time before this we went premium economy the lie flat seats are infinitely better we had a connecting flight from haneda to okinawa the next morning so took a limo bus to haneda and stayed at an airport hotel i thought iid be more restful to break the trip into two segments with an overnight in tokyo it ended up being too much hassle from now on well take a same day flight to okinawa the lie flat seats made the intercontinental segment quite restful and stress free,4
first time with jal and delighted at check in we were escorted to the desk instead of being beckoned which was nice touch the flight was great and the service was exceptional i would go as far as to say this was the best service ever experienced on a flight i have a bony backside so never really comfortable for long haul,5
it was a pleasure flying japan airlines with friendly service and good food and clean airline they helped me with mobility assistance and were so nice,5
everyone was all smile and friendly enjoyed the bento set and haagen dazs ice cream after the main meal i asked for whiskey and the portion was generous and came with an additional cup of water plenty of leg space very comfy seat big and clear screen will book jal again when i next visit japan,4
the sakura lounge in tokyo was fabulous we spent hours there and had draft sapporbeer and food the flight was on time service was nice food was goodseats could be betterpetty uncomfortable,4
hour flight very nice experience a lot leg space amazing staff definitely will travel with jal again loved it,5
i took the am flight from tokyo haneda airport to bangkok and found the schedule to be very efficient and effective the flight departs late at night and arrives very early in the morning lessening the risk of delays due to airport congestion also by arriving so early in bangkok traffic time into the city is substantially reduced i normally allot to hour to get from the airport to my bangkok city hotel in the silom area but was told by the hotel car driver that before am in the morning travel time from airport to hotel is only hour since there is little traffic the flight is also well designed for sleep onboard the seats are older shell flat angledflat seats without direct aisle access for window seats but as i had booked the first row aisle seat my seatmate in the window seat could easily step over my seat even if it is in the bed position as there is plenty of room between the seat and the bulkhead in front the plane used is an older b with a seat configuration in business class so if you are in the middle seat in the center section access would be more of an issue as the flight departs past midnight meal service is breakfast hr min before landing rather than shortly after takeoff on boarding each business class customer is asked to fill in a form indicating whether he or she wanted to be woken up for breakfast and whether the western or japanese breakfast is chosen as a result lights are kept dimmed from takeoff until about hours before arrival i and most other passengers in business class immediately switched to bed position after takeoff as soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off and managed a bit over hours of sleep on a less than hour flight also because it is such a late departure pretty much everyone on board goes to sleep after takeoff so it is quiet in the cabin and there is little to disturb your sleep the western breakfast served prior to landing was impressively full in offering there was a duck salad and a mushroom omelette really good bun andcroissant fruit and greek yoghourt as always jal services its special brand of coffee in business class which is among the best coffees i have had on a plane my only criticism is that the coffee is not available for purchase and only served in flight on landing getting through customs and immigration was very quick as there were not many other flights arriving that early in the morning so the usual long lines at thai immigration was nonexistent and luggage delivery was quick from landing to getting into the car arranged through my hotel to arriving at my bangkok hotel it took only about an hour which is incredibly quick for bangkok overall this flight is a good choice for an efficient arrival and to get full use of your first day in bangkok on arrival prior to departure i used the haneda jal first class lounge as i have oneworld emerald status the lounge is truly superb lots of room in the lounge outlets at all seats good view of the planes docked at the gates and a great dining area with plentiful food options there was even a cook to order section where a chef made grilled special japanese cut of beef with either a japanese sauce of a truffle sauce there were two soup offering including a lobster bisque a western hot food offering of multimushroom pasta two kinds of dim sum japanese udon and curry and a selection of bite size cold appetizers including foie gras on toast i arrived very early on a connecting flight that had landed in narita airport and took the limousine bus between the two airports arriving more than hours before my flight the lounge actually is very quiet until about or pm when it suddenly fills up as haneda airport has a number of longhaul international flights that depart late at night for an early arrival at their destinations,5
jal continues to use an angle flat bed seat in business class on its b dreamliner flights from vancouver to tokyo in a configuration with the window seats not having direct access to the aisle normally this is not a problem as i always select the aisle seat next to the window seat and the typical jal business class customer is a japanese man who is not very large and can get in and out of the window seat by stepping over the aisle seat without too much problems this flight though i had a caucasian larger gentleman in the window seat next to me and he was not familiar with the jal seat configuration he had to ask the flight attendants to help and to wake me to fully convert my seat to upright before he could access his window seat as he was not used to the step over concept and as he was probably not too coordinated having consumed at least or whiskeys within the first couple of hours of the flight this need to convert my seat from bed to seat position each time he had to exit or return to his seat made sleep difficult so really given this is an overnight longhaul flight it is time for jal to upgrade this route to a plane featuring one of its more recent business class seats with a horizontal flat bed and direct aisle access from each seat difficulties with my neighbour aside the flight was fine and featured jals trademark superb service the flight attendants were most polite in asking me to adjust my seat to accommodate the ingress and egress of my seatmate were constantly cleaning the toilet after each use by a customer and even paid attention to really small details like always turning the water glass each time they brought me water so that the jal logo on the glass exactly faced the customer i had the japanese meal for both the lunch and the prior to arrival snack and both were very good featuring numerous little small bites with interesting seasonal flavours one relative weak point is the entertainment system which has a much smaller selection of movies than for example cathay pacific has on its vancouver to hk route also many of the nonwestern movies from japan korea hong kong india etc were only available in their native language and then maybe japanese so that an english only speaker actually cannot take advantage of much of the movie and tv programs lists the plane is new and the service is superb but the angled flat bed and lack of direct aisle access from each seat makes this business class offering a bit behind the times for an overnight flight where undisturbed and good quality sleep is a prime measure of success,4
booked my flight with japan airlines seats actually have room on the hour flight from melbourne i never felt like i was crammed into my seat cabin crew was real friendly and the price of the ticket was reasonably priced will fly this airline again,5
flew from heathrow told at the airport i had not checked in online even though i had confirmed seats online and had also been advised i had checked in after a very frustrating time trying to fathom the worst website i have ever come across we had a flight from london to helsinki via ba then joined jal who immediately informed us they had changed our seats premium economy too i was astounded and complained but was not fully understood i did not want to cause a scene as the flight attendants looked suitably embarrassed and did not really appear to know what i was going on about i have checked in again for the home journey and i will not be changing my seat again be warned jal i am so angry about the situation but know that complaining will i imagine fall on deaf non understanding ears,2
we went from the usa to the philippines round trip with japan air the flight itself was a good price and the movie selection and food were decent the seats werent the most comfortable but they were also fairly decent and the flight attendants were friendly what really bothered us is the mobile checkin we had hours in lax before our flight so we tried checking in online to get our seats reserved the mobile site would not allow it so we decided to wait at the gate until an attendant arrived so we could check in hour before the flight started boarding the attendant arrived and when we checked in they put us on opposite ends of the plane it was our honeymoon so we were not pleased to spend hours apart for the start to our vacation luckily the airline was able to make some changes and put us together moments before the airline began boarding which we greatly appreciated at the end of our vacation we didnt want this happening again so hours before our flight we attempted the mobile check in again this time it let me put my information into the check in services but could not locate my name or reservation number highly displeased that we are having so many issues with our checkin with this airline hope it gets resolved,3
jal overnight to australia served wagyu beef sirloin which was absolutely the best airline meal ive ever enjoyed appetiser of salmon gravlax was also exceptional great to see that some airlines still do value business class travellers and arent cutting costs to the bone instead focusing on higher quality and good service lieflat beds were good for the age f the plane hard to beat the a lieflat experience on other airlines and the entertainment package was very good i will certainly fly jal again after this experience,5
i flew sydnrt return recently on jal and was utterly amazed at the level of service provided by all staff the sydney ground staff were outstanding they were genuinely lovely people who ensured that i felt special from check in to boarding on board the cabin crew seemed so much more attentive and professional than any other cabin crew i have ever seen they just paid so much attention to detail the aircraft a b on both flights was new clean and extremely comfortable the meals were delicious and they provided a selection of western and japanese choices i have flown a lot over the years and on many airlines but jal was without any doubt the best i have ever experienced i have never recommended any airline on social media before but i had never flown jal before either,5
i have flow the sydney vancouver route on japan airlines a few times i find their business class fares competitive and their service is great but there are some caveats and that probably explains the competitive pricing on the vancouver narita route jal flies the b dreamliner business class is a layout theres no staggering on the window side so it presents access issues for anyone on the window seat you need to jump over your neighbor to go to the washroom aside from the layout the other big letdown is the angled flat bed seriously what was jal thinking why put angled flat bed they have a much better sky suite version which flies on the narita sydney route among others the service is very good organized punctual always with a smile menu is limited for business class pretty much a choice of japanese or western food wine selection is okay this flight is a decent one for a daytime journey but not ideal for a nighttime flight,3
i booked tickets for my sister inlaw niece and nephew for oct departure through pricelinecom from manila to portland or they arrived early at the airport to checkin and when they were being checkedin they found out my nephew was missing a document an ecc document emigration clearance certification by all means this is our fault in our part and we dont blame the airline whats so ever this caused a delay on their flight i called jal customer service directly the man that i talked to didnt sound friendly all but i told him the situation i am in he reviewed my confirmation and told me that he couldnt help me out because i bought my ticket through a third partylike a person that doesnt want to deal with you kind a way i called pricelinecom a person by the name tris was such a great help i told her the situation and exchanged information to jal represented i wanted to rebook the tickets but jal was asking tris advice just to purchase new tickets i asked how much to cancel the tickets according to jal its pertickets for noshow they dont have proof that it was a noshow i told that my sister inlaw nephewniece did show and were on time which and we have proof i was supposed to be charged pertickets because they did show during departure but just couldnt leaves due to documentation the conversation wasnt getting nowhere i was already late to work i told tris to just cancel all reservations and i cant deal with this airline any longer jal charged me with a refund of this was my first and will be my last to book for jal according to their fares rules and restriction penalties fare rules text unless otherwise specified note rule ps in iprg applies general rules text fromto philippines cancellations before departure charge usd for cancelrefund note in case of no show cancellation charge usd applies,1
the friendliness of staff is exceptional the seats are super comfortable and very private good food with a choice of western and traditional japanese cuisine on board entertainment could have been better the choice of movies was limited a business lounge at narita airport was absolutely fantastic offering an excellent refreshment facilities a free min back massage as well as super modern and effective massage chairs to use at any time heaven after a long flight,4
great airline the service was beyond great long story but it was a codeshare for work so i switched from aa to jal i was having some luggage issues and was getting help from aa of course so i went to jal and asked and they said aa should do that and i explained how that went she took me to the customer service area from the ticket counter it was unbelievable how awesome she was i was also trying to upgrade by cash to business class without going deep into it she found my bag and said i can go in through security once i was at the gate waiting on boarding she came into the waiting area with my bag to confirm it was the right one i was amazed i said yes and she walked me down the concourse to the plane and said i will personally put it on the plane i was like great and she apologized since she was unable to upgrade me due to aa rules of course on code share i said oh well we tried after i boarded she came to my seat and said how is it i said if i knew it was going to be roomy and nice like this i wouldnt have worried about the upgrade haha she smiled and said thank you and thank you for flying with us truly first class service even in couch,5
i flew in the last days of sep gate at helsinki airport is in a lower ground farfar away and with no facilitieshad to walk upstairs to a jumbo and that was no fun a bus takes you to the helsinki airport on arrival plane to tokyo was late for hrno information given for a long timeconnecting flight to melbourne had less and less time remaining plane was circulating over tokyo several times i think people should know what is going on particularly now no gate numbers given with min left to boarding timeit was a run the info board only in japanese runningno knowing the gate number we made it with others only to wait min again on the plane that was never explained the closest area to boarding does not have coffee shopand not having time does not allow you to have a look for one not good time between long flights are essential for a walkmealrelaxation and coffee for menot to be stressed and underinformed,2
service is great the size of the economy seat is normal food is pretty good especially when the food is reload at japan in my previous trips they serve mos burger as a snack i like the dreamliner the fleet is still new and clean the only thing i do not like is the in flight entertainment which does not have many variety compare to other airlines they have a lot of japanese programs for the local,4
not a bad experience plane was on time and clean crew were courteous unlike other airlines jal does not sell seats but i was able to get good seats by calling them some hours before the flight the check in staff were accommodating they wrapped in plastic one of our bags to provide additional support jal was in partnership with aa in these flights,3
that was an amazing experience the flight attendants were friendly and cute they always said konnichiwa or arigatou in japanese and i love it one more special thing was about the meal on the plane i had breakfast and it was delicious it was delicate and was one of the most delicious meal i had ever had i will fly with jal again soon,5
i cannot say enough good things about jal over the years ive flown both business and economy many times utter professionalism and courtesy at every turn i think very highly of some competitors like korean air and cathay pacific but _no one_ does it with the percent commitment of jal the planes are absolutely pristine the passengers seem particularly well behaved and i believe that is because of the sense of absolute dignity and kindness imparted by the crew the food even in economy is excellent and immaculately presented the wifi service is bombproof and there is no restriction as to how its used as there is on most airlines what i dont get is why some of these asian air carriers are so so so much better than our domestic airlines in the usa what are we missing,5
japan airlines have the friendliest and most helpful staff on the ground and in the air their aircraft are the cleanest in the sky and the business class suite is spacious and very comfortable,5
i had high expectation from the business class of jal on a boeing aircraft but seats in the business class though reclineable to about inches but not ideal for sleeping,3
first of all i am travelling with my wife a years old kid and an infant and i am flying economy check in is smooth as we had been japan for so many times these japanese staff are constantly at it if we got any hiccup then it possible language barrier causing it going into the cabin to my surprise the economy seat wider than all flight i have taken with any other airline i feel like we are flying the so call premium economy of course the overall flight experience is very nice the stewardess gave my kids some toy and souvenir which they love it so much the food is one of the best meal i had in modern flying days and they do take effort to prep kids meal for my daughter and baby meal for my baby boy and everyone meals ends with a cup of delicious ice cream in flight entertainment yes they have bigger screen too and ipad like touch sensitivity hahaha often time people fly with only designated airline for some reason but i think as traveler we all should sometime step out of the sand box and give other reputable airline a go they might cost little more but the experience i have with jal is so pleasant this trip we had flight with jal from osaka to okinawa okinawa to tokyo and tokyo to kuala lumpur so i am here to give a big thumb up on all three flight with jal did i mention on the domestic flight they give free in flight wifi too my very first experience delightful we will definitely fly again with jal,5
early flight from paris to bangkok and the jal staff was wonderful the plane was clean and the staff was attentive,5
excellent service and seating took premium economy from jfk to hnd the seats and the legroom were amazing the menu and complimentary slippers were a nice touch as well also being able to use the air france lounge at jfk which i feel like should be advertised more and the sakura lounge at hnd were added bonuses all worth the extra money from regular economy on a hr flight,5
we flew japan air for the first time for a business trip to tokyo the service was superb the plane was new and very clean,5
this flight left me feeling very impressed with japan airlines apart from the friendly efficient service i received jal was honest and sensitive in a way that i have not seen on other airlines soon after i boarded the airplane an announcement was made that our meal would be served early because the pilots were expecting serious turbulence later in the flight as it turned out i didnt eat anything when the meal was served because i didnt feel hungry much later a flight attendant asked me again if i wanted a meal by that time i was hungry and accepted the offer the flight landed a little later than expected because the pilots had to take a detour to avoid a storm this however was explained to us in a very gracious professional manner i was so impressed with jal,5
i dont normally review airlines but yesterday we flew from tokyo to okinawa in a typhoon and honestly the service was impeccable to say it was a typhoon all of the staff from check in the constantly smiling air stewardesses and the pilot were calm happy and helpful there was a bit of turbulence but i slept through almost the whole thing fantastic also on top of this they gave us this postcard as we left thank you to everyone on flight we look forward to flying with you next week,5
i travel about time a year i board at least planes a year i travelled from bkk to japan via this airline the services is superb and flight attendants are courteous and polite the meals were okay but the drinks and speed of service makes this airline a winner,5
jal is a great airline to fly with the staff from counter staff to hostesses were all professional and friendly the aircraft was clean and comfortable and the food was tasty and well presented,5
we had the best flight to japan this summer aboard jal it was our first flight with this airline and we were very impressed we couldnt believe how much leg room there was in economy class and what great service there was too the meals were delicious there were options western and japanese we chose the japanese meals and they were scrumptious during the entire trip the stewardesses were constantly serving beverages and there was unlimited snacks after dinner the flight was very quiet and the stewardesses were very friendly we will definitely be flying with jal in the future,5
i always look forward to flying with jal and i only had the chance if i an going to japan the food and service are great and they have an excellent customer service orientation typically japanese,5
flew economy class hkgnrt on a dreamliner recently the employee at checkin at the hong kong airport express location in central was the best airline employee ive ever come acrossi had some ticketing issues that he had to call in and resolve for me and then come find me at the nearby starbucks to tell me he did so what a guy so for the goodattentive and classy personnel good food quality for a plane wine great entertainment options cleanliness on time and the was quiet and has large windows that dim electronically the downside is the legroomi would rate this flight much higher maybe stars if the legroom was decent because everything else was great unfortunately jal has not resisted the urge to cram as many seats onto a plane as possible at i notice more than others the difference in legroom i came into hkg on a garuda indonesia flight on an airbus a similar sized plane and they are massively more gracious with the amount of space given in economy class also the fact that you cannot reserve your seat easily during ticket purchase or prior to the flight departure is another downside for economy class would i fly them again maybebut only if there werent similarly priced options available on more spacious carriers cathay pacific garuda singapore etc,3
i traveled jal airlines first time when i am traveling back to haneda from kushiro airport although due to some technical fault flight was delayed more than one hour still first experience of flight interior seat quality impressed me coffee served insider plan was totally different taste and i loved it apart from it there staffs were very supportive and humble i want to travel again with jal,4
i have had international and domistic flights with jal in the past years and always found the food and service on board very good flights have always been on time with check in smooth and friendly baggage allowance is around kg plus hand luggage i found in economy class the leg room and seating on the domistic flights is even better all meals and movies on international economy flights are included in the price unlike some of our australian international airlines jal is my choice for my next flight to japan,4
very kind staff always willing to help japan attitude comfort everywhere really clean boarding officer offered freely extra legroom as im quite tall in comparison to japanese people i suppose,5
i cant speak too highly of the service and the comfort on the flight the food was excellent and i will certainly fly with jal again,5
i flew premium economy from jfk to narita continuing on to manila in economy checkin was fast and easy as i had arrived early to the airport and as a one world sapphire member was able to use the business class counter jal uses the air france lounge which is fine but the food was not replaced on a regular basis i got the feeling the lounge was doing the bare minimum as there were not any af flights departing at the time lounge access for all premium economy is a nice perk not provided by other airlines the seating was great and the configuration of the premium economy section works well there are two toilets in the front that appeared to be for business class but were also used by the premium economy section too this layout is much better than the cathay pacific layout that results in passengers walking over people in the bulkhead row or going to the back of the plane while i prefer a seat that reclines vs sliding down the combination of a larger than normal pitch and the fact that the person in front is not reclining into your space makes the hard shell seat a winner the food was fine nothing great and the service was very good throughout the flight some people may find the english language entertainment sections to be a bit limited,4
due to weather our flight was delayed i have a tendency to fall asleep anywhere and i did just that before we took off when i woke up hours later i thought my eyes were playing tricks on me i still saw tarmac and grass turns out we have been waiting for the weather to turn for the better and havent budged while we were in the air i realized i might not make my connecting flight to akita i asked the flight attendant about it and she did her best to give me updates even she didnt have more information she came back to tell me she is waiting for an answer turns out i only had hour to get past customs collect my luggage which i was planning to ship because they were large and awkward i was carrying instruments and get to the other terminal and board when i got off the plane a jal employee met me and helped carry my luggage all the way to the other terminal unfortunately the carts were not allowed so he carried them by hand i felt very badly for him but was so grateful thanks to all the staff i was able to make my flight and see my parents the same day i was so concerned i would have to wait until the next day i couldnt be more happy my reason for not giving stars is because the food really could be better there is fruit on top of somen and other odd combinations i usually bring my own food despite the food i will continue to fly jal because of the amazing service,4
excellent flight from sydney the seating arrangement was private and sleeping arrangements good the food and wine was really good and the service excellent but not intrusive,5
the business class seats for jal are the best i have ever experienced i was in a which is by the window and the design means you are essentially in your own private seat with a small passage to get into the aisle this is more like first class suites row is also in its own private cabin between first class and the galley so not many people and much more private than the main business cabin with their mattress it was very comfortable for this very long flight service was very attentive with frequent and generous refills of wine a big disappointment for me was the food a choice of japanese of western menu i opted for the western as some of the japanese options were too adventurous for me the squid for the starter has very little flavour and was very tough beef fillet was ok and cooked well considering but on small side i had better luck with the japanese beef curry which is on the snacks menu you can order anytime tasty although a little cold if the food was better this would have been best business class flight i have ever taken,4
average service for the first few hours we were not served food which i thought was not a good practice,3
our tickets were booked with japan airlines the tokyo to london return flights were with british airways premium economy i cant say it was worth the price as there was not much extra leg room i am only five foot three but my husband is six foot three so it is very important for him to have the extra leg room when the seats in front of us were put back it was almost impossible to get out of the seat the flight from sydney to tokyo was very comfortable with more keg room and decent seat recline we are sitting at the airport now waiting for our flight back to sydney it is an evening flight so it will be interesting to see how comfortable an overnight flight will be the photographs are of british airways premium economy i will update my status on japan airlines in a few days,3
great friendly service hot cloths plenty of drinks good food nothing was a problem to the staff free motel on route very lenient on cabin luggage weights,5
first before taxiing i noticed four airline staff outside the airplane lined up and started to wave goodbye the passengers and bow down as japanese do then i loved the toilet which was equipped with electronic bidet which is very clean and hygienic then noticed the windows can be tinted electronically and you can choose how dark the window you want to be as opposed to most aircrafts where you can only block the window and lastly the space between seats are decent compare to other airlines,5
jal is the model of superb customer service by its ground and flight crews the flight crew is very attentive to its passengers unlike other us and european based airline the japanese culture is ingrained into its daily routine which is extended to all passengers food is also very good with traditional nonplastic utensils,5
jal offer a premium business class service with a modern setup that feels a decade ahead of anything ba qantas united or similar midtier airlines offer jal are one of the best their inair service is friendly and attentive you feel like your service is personalized and that they are genuinely interested in making sure you have the best possible experience on top of that on my last outbound flight one of the cabin attendants accidentally returned to me the wrong suit jacket i didnt notice until i arrived at my hotel jal ground service and lost and found were amazing sending me multiple emails checking with cabin crew and genuinely trying to track down my jacket on my departure at the narita checkin desk one of the lost and found staff met me in person to sincerely apologize for this error i was left with the impression that they had gone above and beyond what youd expect from an average airline,5
travelling with a big group of family a and c only toddler and elderly were given the priority boarding kids unfortunately are not given this priority in overall i like their service and the choice for meal serving was big for toddler they served the rice cracker and banana immediately after boarding which was a good surprise that ensure the toddler wont go crying because of hunger the proper meal served was mainly assorted blended vegetable like mashed pumpkin spinach etc not to my toddler liking though but still very good effort for kids meal very nicely done up with lots of choice big serving seat was comfortable flight was punctual the only complaint that i had was the aircond the only flight that i felt warm in the plane compared to all the other airlines its probably good for fuel consumption and energy friendly but slightly too warm for passenger as we ended sweating in the plane,4
my whole family had the best experience ever with japan airlines the flight crew was so polite and pleasant we have flown will all the usa based airlines and a few international carriers like cathay pacific and klm jal has exceeded all are expectations united airlines staff should take some lessons from the jal staff loved the attention to passengers even if they are economy class we traveled with family members who have food allergies they were so attentive and careful with the meals we will fly again with japan airlines thank you for the most flight experience ever,5
ive had the privilege to experience different j classes of various carriers and i have to say jal tops the cake from the gracious helpful staff sumptuous meal and comfy seat jal has really created a high bar when it comes to business class i originally started my trip from seoul to narita on a but my review is about the flight from tokyo to los angeles on board the transiting at nrt was pretty painless just had to go through security make sure laptops are out and no liquids more than ml once past security i made my way to the tranquil sakura lounge definitely try their curry with rice i prefer the design of haneda with its open floor and plenty of natural lighting narita is a bit of a dungeon compared to haneda but i digress after some rr i made my way to the gate jl boards families with tots and those that need assistance afterwards first class fc and diamond members are welcomed on board then business and economy i soon settled into seat k window in the primary business section theres a forward biz section just behind fc a flight attendant came by to introduce herself and served champagne and offered reading material the skysuite is exemplary once the partition goes up its like youre in your own cubicle in a good way although there is a seat next to you you still have aisle access for comparisons sake british airways has a similar layout but youre not afforded your own aisle access and gasp have to hurdle over your facing neighbor the screen is quite large and there is also a handheld remote to control content the seat is upholstered comfortable and has a massage feature the seat also changes to a fullflat bed and an airwave mattress topper is provided the inflight entertainment ife is quite extensive and contains new releases as well as classic movies once airborne the smiling fa s quickly commenced service unlike us carriers i feel like fa s on most asian carriers like their jobs and want to provide utmost service i describe it as a white glove touch they never seem hurried and pay attention to the detail like ensuring the jal logo on the wine glass is facing you if youre keen at all definitely go for the multicourse japanese menu our menu started with tofu and a dish of tuna followed by a bento of japanese appetizers then the main course followed beef tongue and cod along with rice and miso soup my fa kept offering wine i had to politely decline once dinner wrapped up the fa advised me i could order anything off the handheld device i think its really great you can order anytime and not have to flag an fa or ring the call attendant button the snack menu is quite extensive as well go for the ramen and pork cutlet sandwich sadly before i knew it i could see the california coastline and we began our descent into los angeles overall i was quite impressed with the whole flight from the crew food bed and ife i will certainly consider jal for my next trip to asia,5
my first experience flying jal international more than hours of flight delay in japan we had to take the last connected flight instead of arriving at pm i arrived home at am the next day although they gave a food voucher of yen that is hardly compensating domestic osaka to new chitose and new chitose to tokyo they served you cup juice or plain water thats how the service i will never fly jal again,3
i transferred from ba to jal in hong kong it was relatively short flight compared to ba but its service was far superior to that of ba only the problem is that seat pitch is small so bigger people jal is not comfortable as it should be,5
fly with boeing dreamliner for the food and service i gotta say jal never let me down 日航夢幻客機商務艙座椅舒適度不在話下可以調色的窗戶展現科技實力但最愛的還是貼心親切的服務以及好看又好吃的餐點 精緻料理搭配清酒紅白酒啤酒都完美,4
seat size is acceptable meal serve only one prior to arrival early morning as it was a midnight flight for those who fly jal midnight flight should have taken dinner before boarding otherwise you could have felt hungry throughout the flight,4
this is my first time taking japan airlines even though it is the short distance from taipei to tokyo i still enjoy the good flight experience because the comfortable seats in economy class and homelike space and the flight ticket is not as expensive as i thought now that makes me rethink to treat myself well to relish quality as well as good price even if most people prefer to fly by cheap airlines,5
chose a day flight to avoid jetlag did not expect to sit for hours with all the blinds down and the lights off only had my reading light spent time at the back looking out of the tiny window as we flew over northern russia as the inflight entertainment was rubbish,2
flight was on time checkin slick cabin crew friendly comfort soso food not bad we chose a day flight depart am tokyo arrive lhr pm especially to avoid jet lag a technique that has always worked in the past however the airline insisted of keeping the blinds closed and the cabin lights off for pretty well the full twelve hours of the flight sitting in aisle seats we could do nothing about this apart from spending much time at the back where there were a couple of tiny windows the point of choosing a day flight is to have a normal nights sleep before have a very long day travelling then go to bed at the destination resulting in minimal disruption to the body clock passengers do not need to sleep for hours during the day westerly flight to the usa do not adopt this procedure why on earth does the airline act in this ridiculous way my cynical guess is that it keeps passengers from making too many demands on the cabin crew also the inflight entertainment consisted of a few childrens films and some awful science fiction dreadful,2
good flight good service of course few space for legs but better than many other companies food acceptable good entertainement,4
jal is the best airlines i have ever flown the level of service surpasses every single us based airline the cabin crewwas so attentive to our special diet needs as well as to my yr old daughter the only downside is that they partner with american airlines so when the international leg of the flight is over and you transfer to domestic the level of service basically goes away,5
our first trip to japan we flew jal im so glad we did checkin was seamless easy our japanese experience commenced as soon as we boarded the plane being greeted in japanese quickly given a lovely warm hand towel on the way over we got bulkhead seats allowing lots of leg room but even on the return in a normal seat the seats were still comfy with good leg room offered the meals were tasty filling often having choices between japanese or western food snacks personally i was happy to dive straight into japanese flavours cuisine service was fantastic with nothing being a problem for the extremely professional staff i found the choices of movies entertainment good as well the dimming of the cabins after our meals was great allowing a peaceful rest if so desired staff assisted me in learning some key japanese phrases pronunciation which i was really grateful for we look forward to travelling to japan again in the future will not hesitate to go with jal great flight great service great food very friendly staff thankyou,5
excellent service at the airport and in flight kind attention even in small details free wifi is another plus,5
stewardess speaks english with the director of cabin attendants division but the young ladies except the director was very afraid to answer important sensitive questions regarding food ingredients i must say service is fine but the quality of ingredients for food served are not made in japan what meaning does this kind of choices means for jal not promoting own countrys products or just saving cost or simply blind to the fact that passengers have no say,4
the legroom was actually better than the american airlines we took on the return trip to the usa from narita we felt the cabin overall was clean especially the bathroom was very clean on a very long flight kudos to the flight attendants for constantly maintaining cleanliness of the bathrooms i dont think any other airlines flight crew do this and it is really appreciated i wish other us carriers could be more attentive to such details as well overall flight attendants were very kind patient and pleasant as a customer it made us feel we could reciprocate to be respectful as well,5
i flew tokyo from bc several times by jal and appreciated the excellent service food entertainment and cleanliness on this international route i tried the domestic route from narita to fukuoka and found their services standard as good as international route specifically tsuchiya the stewardess,5
have flown many airlines in years but never one that will not let y pre book your seats if youre coach ticket does not have a certain designator not allowed to choose a seat nor even allowed to seek out a seat from jal reservations in the us they should note that at the time of your acceptance of a booking as well as all internet companies selling a jl ticket that you cannot reserve a seat until day of boarding if your ticket designator blocks y from a pre reserved seat designation because of price buyer beware,2
great service comfortable seats meals plus snacks free entertainment movies and games free luggage check in for each passenger lbs each crew so pleasant hot towels foods was served with real utensils all our needs were taken care of including tooth brush socks and tooth paste,5
the japanese know how to treat well their customers it was a long flight and usually we get tired and bored during so many hours inside an airplane but the jals crew didnt want us to get bored and they were coming all the time to offer something to drink or to eat even during the night they would pass in the aisles very silently with a tray with water or juice just in case you were awaken and wanted to drink something the meals were very tasty and very fulfilling even if i was flying economy the crew was very solicitous and always smiling it was a great flight,5
have been flying with them all the time never been disappointed with their attentive services their services are getting better considering their competition with ana sushi served at their first class lounge in nrt is one of the best lounge foods,5
very polite good service clean and not too expensive cost will choice again if have a chance narita airport are nice to look around but business waiting room are poor,5
this is my preferred airline and i am also jal mileage collector so i always chose this airline over others where they fly if not my preference will be one of the one world members airline usually good ontime departurearrive to the destination easy check in unlike others very generous baggage allowance too and usually connect well for domestic flights or other international connection flights in flight service great selection of movies games music from personal screen in front of your seats good selection of complimentary beverages are always helpful for long flight business class seat is exceptional and personalized attention to detail service is fantastic they even come to your seat and make a bed with real good quality pillow and comforter not to mention food drink selection quality quantity are perfect economy class functional well designed seats usb charger bottled water holder etc good polite service not like many of nothing american airlinesthere are no bad attitude to the guests however i feel quality of service and quantity of food has gone done slightly compare to previous years i use this airline yrs for last yrs there were few incidents that encounter over the years with them but at the end they usually make it right for the guests and overall still consider good flight experience i have no hesitation recommending this airline,4
we have flown this route actually its flights with a stopover in nikita hotel accommodation included in ticket times over the last decade and have found it a perfect way to make such a long trip from australia the flight from sydney to tokyo is under hours and a business class or premium economy ticket gets you into the qantas lounge in sydney and the sakura lounge in nikita tokyo after a good nights sleep in one of the airport hotels and a leisurely start to the next day the nikitaparis flight is hours flying with the sun so you arrive in the afternoon paris time and if you can force yourself to stay awake for a few more hours usually you can get another good nights sleep and wake early to start your holiday jal offer both western and japanese meals and the food is excellent portion sizes are just right not too big and you can eat as much or as little as you want as they do a set meal and then have an anytime menu the staff are all lovely so polite and charming the seating pods are comfortable and if youre lucky enough to score a window seat they are completely private when you raise the screen between seats in business class they stretch out completely flat and there are mattress pads blankets cardigans etc available they usually have a good range of movies and games,5
youve seen those headlines passengers bribed coerced beaten and dragged off of planes people sitting on the runway for hours on endless delays kids and babies booted off seats that were paid for etc this type of thing would be unimaginable for a serviceoriented country and culture like japan theyd probably commit seppuku before being portrayed in the media in any of the above incidents i kid you not just look walk into a starbucks mcdonalds or any store supermarket in tokyo excellent service is common in japan from the low to high end japan airlines comparatively is more than competent boarding and exiting is well organized in a low key manner the staff greet and thank you as you embark and disembark the seats are not squeezed in to maximize profits as it cuts off circulation for people over ft food is awesome with some local flavor dishes minus the third meal on long flights that is a more a snack c hotdogs for me the attendants are all smiles and attentive asking if you need blankets pillows extra snacks drinks long periods cooped up in a confined space is much more bearable with good movies tv selection or just play games on your own ipad or nintendo switch overall japan airlines is a rare beacon of light in todays airline industry one that still treats its customers well coupled with the japanese propensity for service its a win,4
as good as it gets in economy class flight crew maintained a constant smile and was very helpful unfortunately after i got to jfk i had to fly jetblue to jacksonville they were terrible they made the cabin freezing cold and then wanted to charge for a blanket and they make you watch advertising the whole flight unless you rent headphones to watch movies,5
great flight great food and able to catch up on movies i have missed would fly again cabin was very comfortable and first time i have experienced the windows that dont have blinds but have the tint adjust surprisingly this was very effective and i was able to catch some zzzzs as well love technological advances,5
i have a theory always fly the airline of the country i flew japan airlines from jfk to tokyo on the beautiful the interior was stunning with low lighting tinted windows that dimmed as to adjust time zones replaced by the standard shades the super comfortable sky seat was like a cubicle with flat beds and a big tv monitor partitions went up automatically i never saw my neighbor the entire flight it was like a private little room i ordered the japanese dinner which was superb and the highest end sake the fight attendants were young and impeccable my one complaint was the bar which only had half a bottle of wine a bottle water and some crackers the entertainment system should add more english movies over all excellent i almost didnt want to get off the hour flight,4
this was our first trip to hawaii from bangkok and we were thankful that jal made the trip pleasurable and with very reasonable and competitive fares business class check in was smooth and the lounge in bangkok was excellent unlike the lounge for the national airline which is always over crowded the first leg to narita took about hours with a hour transit which was perfect to get down and stretch our legs and it was another hours to honolulu narita airport is a fun place to walk around do some shopping for snacks and have a delicious meal but the food in the plane was high quality as well and offered japanese of course as a choice most importantly i found the service by the air hostesses to be excellent there were no male stewards im not complaining and im thinking perhaps its a japanese culture reason inflight entertainment was good with decent choices of new movies no problems at all checking thru our bags to our final destination and upon arrival our bags arrived at the baggage claim without issue overall i would definitely fly jal again,5
even if economy class a seat of ss was very comfortable a seat size of cm pitch long and cm wide is larger than other airlines before and during boarding i was satisfied with staffs service,5
the plane was very clean and fresh smelling stewardesses were professional polite and friendly inflight entertainment was good in one of our domestic flights there was free wifi the food was very tasty and they catered to my partners dietary needs well they did rounds to make sure we were well hydrated toilets were quite clean too the seats were comfortable and the legroom was sufficient on both international and domestic flights only thing i dont understand is why our luggage did not go straight to sapporo we had to remove our luggage at haneda and check it in again for sapporo,4
very comfortable flight with attentive cabin crew the breakfast was appalling breakfast i could see what they were trying to do with a different type of breakfast burger but by the time it had been heated and served it was just horrible to look at and to eat as a general rule just dont eat airline food,4
made this flight last october this was a very comfortable flight ample space and service was excellent food outstanding and you could choose different courses in short a pleasurable experience,5
as a frequent traveller on the paristokyo route i favor jal over ana and af mostly for the consistency of their service quality which i have experienced in business premium and economy class it is not flawless but dependably satisfactory meeting expectations in each class of service seating is comfortable food and beverages are tasty and servings are just right drink refills and tray removal can be slow at times but staff is usually courteous and gracious the size and quality of audio selections are a plus even though english descriptions are scarce videomoviesspecial programs are abundant and wideranging,5
i have flown jal to canada and back several times now and am never disappointed the new dreamliner is comfortable as are the other planes flying this route boarding procedures are efficient well organised and on time cleanliness of public areas is superb i am especially happy that the toilets are kept in really good condition for the duration of the flights staff are consistently helpful and friendy the meals are very good and the japanese menu offers a lighter but filling meal suited to time spent in a seat my only minor gripe is that the entertainment available is limited compared to some other airlines i have used but this is not a reason not to choose jal i thoroughly recommend this airline,5
we flew bc from bnehkgnrtnrtsydbne in may and i have to say it was me of my favourite flights yet attention to detail is great we slept well and arrived refreshed in both destinations my husband has flown bc from bne thru to bos via japan on many occasions also and cant fault them,5
hadnt flown with jal in a while and i finally flew with them again during my recent trip and i wasnt disappointed the flight attendants were polite and service was good airplane food usually isnt something to be raved about but i thought the food onboard was quite good,4
its my first time to fly jal and it was very good all in all seat was comfortable with good space the entertainment tv has plenty of channels and movies to choose from food was great the flight attendant was okay didnt encounter any rude or unfriendly ones minor negative factors were the rough touchdown when we arrived at tokyo narita i am not sure if weather played a role with it and another one was that my miles asiamiles werent credited for the flights after checking the ticket type it should have earn miles i didnt report it via missing miles anymore because the process was a bit tedious overall i would definitely consider booking with this airline again especially for flights going to japan,4
everything about this airline is meticulously superior to any us flagged carrierthe customer service at the gate the service during the flight the number of flight attendants the food quality the attention to details that focus on passenger comfort one prime example there were disposable toothbrushes and toothpaste available in the lavatories on a flight that lasts hours that is a very welcome amenity,5
in the usual japanese style the flight boarded on time the boarding process was calm easy and efficient we departed exactly on time and the flight was the most comfortable short haul domestic economy flight that i think i have ever had in years of flying leg room was excellent even for a cm plus passenger the seats were comfortable and the plane was clean and even the floor was spotless we even had free wifi unfortunately the flight was too short to enjoy all the luxuries of the flight i normally hate flying but i really enjoyed this flight,5
i booked my flight by my mileage account from website of jalbut wrong name is on my ticket that i received before boardingits so dangerous,3
the service was great and the plane itself felt bigger than most i have been on before will for sure fly japan airlines again bathrooms were really clean,4
this is jal youre talking about so imo youre almost never going to have any serious qualms about the level of attention and care in their service the movies were up to date i managed to snag an exit row seat and the food was good but not very filling for me one minor quip i watched the english version of the minions movie inspanish something was wrong with the system there finally they were pretty strict about the dimensions of my bike box just a smidge over the cm and i wound up paying jpy i usually get away with it but these people play by the rules,4
overnight flight to sydney boarded last together with other economy class passengers premium economy seats are slightly wider than economy seats are in a shell so can slide forward but not completely just a little bit more and it would have been a comfortable flight couldnt get any sleep as we got seats next to the restrooms that flushes noisily food was same as economy premium economy gets champagne choice of entertainment was ok flight attendants very attentive,4
its quite a pleasant trip with jal from checkin boarding cabin cleanness crew curtesy to food flavor the only thing annoying is high frequency of flight announcement in or languages,5
my wife i flew from boston to tokyo and then on the next day to sydney the service on both flights was excellent the staff were so courteous and looked after us well i had flown on the dreamliners before and never cease to be impressed by their smooth flying and fast service between destinations certainly would not hesitate to fly with them again,4
seat was good and the space was reasonably wide tv screen was large ans i could enjoy the movies food was also good far better than jl fly to san francisco a pair of mules was also equipped which was not for jl to sfo since it was high season the ticket price was extremely expensive,4
have flown premium eco with a number of airlines the whole experience from ease of booking to pre flight and in flight service was the best by far the only minor gripe was that the seat was a little firm but with the seat capsules you werent disturbed by the person in front or behind reclining their seat as it all happened within their capsule it more than made up for the firmness of the seat changing flights we were only charged a each but this was our choice so considering what some of the low cost airlines charge it wasnt too bad ticket price was very competitive in fact cheapest at the time for us flying this way to europe is the best when you consider the time spent in the air to get to your destination as compared other routes efficiency of cabin staff and cleanliness of plane and japan in general is very good,5
happy with japan airlines although were not impressed with the mandatory stop over in tokyo the flight itself was good with comfortable seats good service the food was a bit hit and miss what we were not happy about was the hotel we were taken to on the way to europeit was very ordinary on purchasing our tickets we were advised the stopover included dinner bed breakfast plus transfers upon arrival at the hotel we were advised no meals were includedreception staff were helpful phoned the airline to no avail i eventually had to speak to the airline and after much discussion they reluctantly agreed to cover meal costs all this took around an hour to sort out was quite annoying we still have had no reply from japan airlines as to why this happened,4
i could reserve exit row seats for my wife and me where we did really enjoy our stay in the flight smile of cabin attendants added our stay more comfortable,5
you can feel that everything is crafted with japanese zen style service is very good i will take jal into priority when fly to japan,5
the stewardess are very friendly with a lot of complimentary offerings to make your flight the most enjoyable,4
the overall flight experience is above average especially in premium economy is it that much better than other international flights that is debatable my upcoming trip to japan is going to be on delta airline package price became a consideration premium economy is my choice,5
the flight attendants provided personal business class service to their economy class customers the food was also better than i have experienced on some business class flights,5
the cabin crew were reliably helpful and spoke excellent english their service was efficient and quick the food quality was medium to good depending on what was ordered i had the asian vegetarian meals which were fine but not good enough to look forward to the regular meals seemed more appetizing the selection of films was excellent the flight departed and arrived on time i would definitely recommend this airline,4
jal was one of the very few airlines that provided metal cutlery and serviette that was large enough to cover the thighs the food was well prepared with salad hot main and dessert the service was good and the seat had sufficient leg room the rest rooms were cleaned regularly with supplies refilled as comparison cathay pacific gave me a pie that passed the expiry date qantas cutlery worked like toys that could not cut anything and the serviette was just slightly larger than a tissue paper for air canada i became hungry hours after the main meal luckily i got a lot of snacks with me but you need to be careful about one thing with jal do not choose the flight with connecting domestic flight provided by jetstar not only you need to pay for everything drinks snacks on board of jetstar the choices were limited and the service was below satisfaction,5
japan airlines make details count from boarding the plane finding your seat with eye mask sandals noise cancelling headphones i am talking about economy seat the flight departed on time if you fall asleep while the serve the food you will find a sticker in front of you telling you to call the attendants when you wake up so you can get your food lavatory had tooth brushes available and cotton swaps so next time i have an intercontinental flight i will make sure i look for japan airlines or anything else rather than airlines in us,5
we flew on the new dream liner series the seats were standard business seats but very comfortable we chose the japanese food option it was great the service offered by cabin crew was excellent i can highly recommend this airline to any travelers,5
outbound to narita was dreamliner and inbound on although the dreamliner is a much newer plane i much preferred the as it is definitely more spacious and comfortable i didnt quite like the way the seat reclines in comparison to the conventional seats on the apart from the wider seats on the much have been said in forums about the less dry cabin conditions but on this approx hr flight it would not have been an issue however i have to say the dreamliner is a much quieter plane and more high tech although the is obviously older the condition is still good in terms of person to person contact experience i would say jal is very good from the word go checking in was pleasant enough on both ends cabin service was also very good,5
took a flight from sin to jfk with a hr stop over in hnd was initially concerned that i could not make the flight if the gates were far apart on that day we just had to go up the escalator and the new gate was there whew on the flight staff left snacks at the galley along with bottles of water during the overnight portion snacks were nicer than the meals they served too dry,4
while it is clear that the airline had upgraded its seats in economy to provide more space the lumbar was permanently fixed in a position that i could not bear for the long flight then i needed to fly from tokyo to singapore this was a very uncomfortable round trip journey on the same style of aircraft all other aspects of the flight were perfectly fine,3
i chose jal simply because of its schedule we had not travelled on jal before as we are usually quite faithful to qatar or sia therefore we did not have high expectations for jal economy class imagine our delight when the service was excellent the staff were pleasant and efficient best of all the food was of exceptionally high quality the servings were large the menu was varied and the salads were fresh better than most other airlines in economy class we will definitely fly jal again,4
from the moment you board the flight you are greeted by warm and attentive crew in typical japanese style the proffessional manner in which you are greeted and taken care of is simply the best that i have experienced on any airline the business class seat is private and comfortable try to avoid the middle seat as my partner found it rather boxed in your ability to order using your personal seat device makes it much easier and your meal is prepared and served prompty i would fly jal long haul when ever i can,5
we flew bostontokyo narita on a and tokyosingapore on a both flights on business class were excellent with the famed japanese hospitality in evidence a comfortable mattress was provided for sleeping on the flat bed but no pajamas i was in the window seat with complete privacybut the space lacks storage surfaces vegetarian cuisine was average and inflight entertainment was not as good as some other carriers,5
jals business class is always better than the average of all airlines especially fb attendants attitude seat comfort as well as cleanness,4
the service from the time we checked in until we arrived at narita was excellent really enjoy flying with jal,5
jal has great staff from check in to baggage pickup flight attendants are great service conscious and always super courteous airplane is a great plane to fly with comfortable seating seats are fixedreclining is within the shell flight has on board wifi as well as adjustable table trays only nuisance is difficulty with internet check in and seat selection however check in clerks were great in making adjustment since i wanted seats side by side another issue might be heavy use of japanese language with more englishkorean might be considered however i would use jal again,4
from start to finish we were very happy customers in sydney we were able to take full use of the business lounge at qantas as part of our ticket price which was excellent and full use of the business lounge in tokyo before our flight home as is typical with japanese people we were shown kindness and care during our flight i love the warm moist towels to clean your hands before meals and the attention of the flight stewards was really appreciated nothing is too much trouble the food was good for airline meals and the plane was very clean we loved our flight and japan so much we re booked to go back there again two weeks after arriving home,5
i actually had two other flights with jal during the course of my trip and they were all excellent the only issue was the internationaldomestic connection aa at bostons logan airport where it was unclear that we were to drop off our bags after clearing customs at this side counter that seemingly was marked for airlines other than aa and jl it seems logan does international to domestic connections differently than other airports other airports have an obvious baggage recheck place they did have a list of people making connections and their baggage though so presumably they were looking out for people,5
excellent flight and services i am frequent flyer with japan airline and have enjoyed travelling with them several times a year i would definitely recommend them without any hesitation food beverages drinks hospitality and flight checkin are excellent,5
flight was delayed flying with american airline from lax but attendants are very helpful in transiting and gave airport restaurants voucher due to the delay feeling welcome and appreciated,4
excellent flight excellent service by attendants good food warm and fresh they are on time or landing early passengers are treated with the highest regard fares are reasonable and overall jal is comparable to cathaypacific and singapore airlines and much much better than emirates for food and service we go to indonesia every year this has become our airline of choice after flying emirates singapore cathaypacific and united,5
its well worth the extra money to fly this route in pe the seats are great the service is fantastic and you get lounge access,5
very pleased with jal easy checking in and lounge available for business class passengers flight personnel very attentive food very good and both asian and western menus available seats can be adjusted to lie flat so comfortable for hour flight,4
myself and family always fly with japan airlines between vancouver and japan after several subpar experiences with air canada years ago since then we are nothing but pleased with the level of customer service from bookinginquiries to the staff on board japan airlines makes flying long haul economy bearable and often times enjoyable meals offered are often more than adequate in taste and portion size would highly recommend this airline,5
not to generalize but ive noticed that many of the asian airlines tend to be a little skimpy on their cocktail service small pours and its quicker to go back to the galley and ask that said the seats were comfortable but not true lieflat beds angle flat the great food with a lovely presentation decent inflightentertainment system with enough english language titles to keep me amused,4
when i first purchased the ticket through the aa website i didnt realize it was a codeshare with jal until a few days before my trip when i was reviewing my travel paperwork having flown through narita in the past i expected the long flight to be an ordeal to forget about and nothing more instead i was quite pleasantly surprised by the excellent service and equipment there was more than enough leg room which i often have trouble with the food was great and the inflight entertainment offerings made the trip much more enjoyable than i could have anticipated i would definitely recommend flying jal,5
nice service udon noodles are delicious champagne is wonderful super friendly fa i do really like their angel smiles spacious seat for average person,5
my first time flying with them on this route as expected their service amenities and food are solid but not to the point where impressed considering them usually getting rated higher than many others i expected more their seating arrangements the type of jet all normal but not a flight attendants werent as attentive as they used to be,4
my wife and i veteran travelers nations decided to tour vietnam viet nam the real name and a bit of cambodia siem reap angkor wat we looked at options including using our ff miles on american the price to fill in to mile each on american was stunning so we picked jal we also know that asian airlines are noted for better service and it proved true again we had a codeshare flight elplax a sixhour layover its good we had united club coupons from our son and his wife hours to tko hours in tko and hours to han all the reservations checkins and flights went very well in tko we took a break to make block prints of hiroshiges famous wave picture on the way home ee retraced our route this time with a hour layover in tko oof again we had united club coupons we had one interesting episode trying to get from what i recall was terminal in tko to terminal to get to the united club for about hours before returning to terminal were we officially in transit on the interterminal bus and not entering japan it took about officials of various levels to figure out that it was okand it was the shuttlebus driver who made the decision again the flights were all fine,5
tokyo to boston is a hour flight i am i flew economy this is a recipe for disaster fortunately japan airlines makes this flight eminently tolerable the is a great plane to fly the legroom was sufficient the food was plentiful and tasty the entertainment options were varied most of all the flight attendants are extremely accommodating why cant us airlines provide the same level of comfort that foreign airlines provide,5
the flight with united was smooth very attentive flight attendants beds were comfortable and food was superb ditto for jal i would fly with both airlines again and again,5
this is something that really put me off from travelling back to japan especially via haneda the flight was unmemorable with that cabin crew simply looking at your face as if saying maybe if i go away you will stop asking me something and i could not wait from leaving that kind of environment worse as i was flying business class on an almost empty flight which was delayed i could not believe when reaching haneda airport although being the first to leave the flight and reach security i witnessed lots of people could not understand if they were japanese or from nearby countries who were joining the security queues together with friends thus coming in front of me from what was originally an empty queue i moved queues times as this kept occurring and i did not want to travel at midnight in a new city which i did not know the security guys kept asking people to open their suitcases as if expecting to find diamond rocks and asked me the same then kept patting my kg suitcase as i tend to travel very minimalistic everywhere and only stopping when he reached my underwear bag i could not believe these people are so intrusive and worse the security guy a very tall slim guy in his s asked a tiny japanese girl to check my body i said that i do not mind to check my there in front of everybody so she decided to pat my body absolutely everywhere i was shocked as this did not happen to me in any other part of the world worse than security people in third world countries i told this story to so many people and not one single person told me of a similar experience clearly this show that important security guy wanted to warm himself up by telling this kind of story and what he is capable of doing at work this was truly shocking and sickening to me no wonder it put me off from ever returning to japan should this airline move their hub to a different location i might consider visiting tokyo again as no woman would want to encounter such rude uncivilised and primitive people with such huge issues at work affecting people who simply travel the world thus contributing to the economy of that country,1
flew for the first time in jal business class although it was just a short flight of little more than hours the experience was very very good the flight attendants are as in typical japanese service very attentive to details and very courteous to the passengers the food was one of the best business class meals i have had in a while although the seat was not the newest layflat type but it didnt matter for our short flight in all a very memorable experience and will surely fly jal again in the near future,5
having flown economy in various other international airlines on transcontinental flights leg space and seat wdth in jal seems to be bestinclass food choices could have been better and their code share with aa doesnt translate to the same levels of comfort in aa economy overall a good flying experience,4
the title says it all this is the first time for me flying with japan airlines and definetely will not be the last their stewardess are courteus and so keen on serving its passangers i never had a flight where the steward go round and round offering different kinds of drinks each hour during the flight i think japanese culture is essential in jal and we can see it directly on how we are served their economy class is on of the moat spacious for boeing it was like flying with airbuss great experience and very reasonable price,5
even in economy class jal offers more leg rooms than any other airlines i was surprised by how comfortable the seats were and very attentive service flight crews provided food is nice and unique they offered some local delicacy on our flight i would certainly fly with jal again and highly recommend to others,5
great service again from jal very attentive staff food selection is great flight was great toilets are spacious seat in premium economy is great plenty of room would fly jal again,5
dreamliner is a great place plenty room service is great movie selection was good food was great loved the mos burger for breakfast a little strange but still nice great airline with great service wouldnt hesitate to fly again on jal,5
great direct flight from cdg to haneda clean airplane cost me only euros not expensive if you compare with the prize of ana and af in this routethe food was good personal cabin very nice i watched great recent moviesthe seat was confortable im only m so i didnt have any problem concerning the legroom i will fly again with this airlines,5
on an extremely long flight it is important that you feel comfortable and on our hour flight from chicago to narita we felt just that the flight attendants were very accommodating and spoke excellent english the seats in the economy class were comfortable and spacious it was nice that jal gives their passengers free pillows blankets headphones and complimentary meals considering most other airlines make you pay for such things the in flight movie selections were excellent they had wonderful vegan meals provided to my boyfriend and i at no extra charge overall a very positive experience i look forward to flying with jal on my return to japan next year,5
one of the best airlines i have travelled with their flight attendants are one of the most friendliest around we were well looked after on our flights nothing was too much for them and they went out of their way for my daughter my daughter wasnt too keen on her kids meal the attendant noticed this and made another meal especially for her the food was tasty and beautifully presented the seat was very comfy would definitely fly with them again,5
no no no said the flight attendant in the galleybacking away from me with her arms crossed meaning no i actually said dont panic because of her actions and the look on her face her backward steps took her to the end of the galley where another female attendant appearedthey spoke in their native tongue with the initial attendant voice being high pitched and indicating by arm and hand gestures a person injecting themselves into the arm joint i was distressed what had i done here am i a year old bald short man who has a history of blood clots and i had just injected myself with clexane a blood thinner in accordance with medical advice on long distance flights i recapped the needle in the toilet stepped out and asked the flight attendant whether they have a needle disposal container with the capped needle lying in the palm of my hand i couldnt believe itanother flight attendant also in the galley then looked up at the fuss responded very politely that they cannot take needles would i like a plastic bag i declined but told him i am a long term recreational traveller and am really distressed at how the attendant responded i put a comment on jal face book page but they have deleted it this could be a safety issue the attendants training or the attendant needs to be reviewed how would she react in a real crisis when i said i would report the matter and wished to left alone for the last hours of the flight this was not complied with i was approached in my seat whilst in the aisle waiting to disembarki said leave me alone but another attendant approached me dispite my protests walking up the air bridge with me when i ignored her and again said leave me alone she approached my travelling companion who is japanese about my concerns shocking this is both a possible safety issue as well as the manner a passenger was treated and thereafter in my opinion harassed when i said i would report the matter really really disappointing and distressing at the timei went to jal comments complaints section they say in effect they may not reply they may reply after a short period if they do reply the reply is copyrighted to jal so here is my experience of jal business class,1
i have flown on and off with japan airlines for many years staff is always courteous and professional the planes are new and clean food and entertainment are usually what you expect from a good international airline snacks are laid out for customers to help themselves what im most impress is the amount of legroom that you get even if you are in economy class this says a lot when the rest of the industry is trying to get by with as little space as they could always a pleasant experience with them,5
this was my first experience of both jal and premium economy it covers sectors sydnrt nrtjfk and return checkin priority bag drop for online checkin but pe has priority itself the aircraft sectors one sector nrtjfk overall the was quieter and more comfortable than the the dimming windows on the didnt block light fully a problem on the south facing side of the aircraft transpacific on the i understand pe is meant to share toilets with economy but pe travelers used the business class toilets immediately in front of pe jal has switched to for sydnrt since march the seats legroom is good although still not quite stretch out and sleep for my plenty of adjustment large tray table although this is reduced for bulkhead seats due to the seat arm storage of both it and the video screen is seats across economy is and respectively lounge access a real selling point for jal pe access to quality lounges in sydney qantas narita sakura lounge and jfk air france in order of preference food and drink interesting and tasty if you enjoy japanese food certainly a cut above most economy offerings even though pe is only a couple of addons champagne and shochu are pe specific wine offerings average good range of soft drinks and beer normal barely drinkable economy and black tea as hot drinks but also green tea and miso service overall polite and attentive personal welcome by name as head of our family my wife and i chose to sleep from boarding our final sector and awoke to handwritten notes that our main meals were still available if wanted entertainment jal moove new sky entertainment is the musical sting at the beginning of everynewentertainmentepisode aaargh the selection is quite reasonable for adults and teens less so for younger not extensive but reasonable quality summary a very enjoyable experience ive already booked jal pe for sydnrtbos and return later this year,5
we had a good experience in the air france lounge at cdg with good quality food and beverage my husband had a nice shower prior boarding to freshen up after the ordeal of returning the car hire btw please check the exact return location at cdg before driving there as its in terminal and all international flights depart from terminal which requires a train transfer an interesting observation of the flight was that all cabin crew were female on both legs they were very polite sweet and carried out their duties with charm and grace ive fallen in love with the dreamliner the first time i flew them on royal brunei a few years ago the seats are so spacious and takes up the length of windows the monitor is large and the noise cancelling headphones are effective the entertainment options were somewhat quite poor comparing to what qantas and cathay pacific offer the pa also is another area where they can improve on im used to listening to qantas cx etc cockpit crew more comprehensive announcement and to struggle to hear a minimum need to know basis announcement was inadequate for me having said that the food really made up for the shortcomings this was by far the best business class food weve had and we have been flying bc on a few different airlines every year for the past years the japanese menu offer which i took came in a beautifully presented bento box and everything was delicious i would not normally eat twice when i fly but i made an exception for this one after having read the menu i was happy to wake up to the second offering again from the japanese menu we also suffered minimal jet lag coming home and i would attribute that to the dreamliner environment with extra amount of oxygen soft lighting and the light japanese food will look forward to flying them again perhaps on the direct route to and from melbourne,5
a short and very pleasant trip my wife mother and i travelled from busan to tokyo earlier this year and it was our first flight on jal what a pleasant and easy surprise i must admit that everything from the boarding to the staff and even the fellow passengers were so considerate and helpful my wife was pregnant at the time and everybody made a great fuss over her the meals was basic but palatable the flight was smooth and the landing too just a great overall experience for todays economy options i highly recommend the airline,4
i have flown with jal a few times now the seats in economy are very roomy and there is plenty leg room and i am a cuddly sort the food is very good and there is plenty of it the flight attendants leave out snacks and juice when they are having rests the entertainment variety is not as good as other carriers but is adequate i watched films on the way out to japan and on the way back i watched films plus some short features about japan i had almost exhausted the film selection by then the flight ran out of diet coke and they only gave a small plastic cup of drink at a time so make sure you take plenty of water on board the crew are very friendly and helpful on board but the bag drop was very slow despite checking in online one of the best airlines i have used but doesnt top or others,4
my first time taking jal and i loved it i must say that it is the best medium haul economy class experience for me not only are the seats comfy there is much more leg space compared to other airlines i wished they had direct flights to hokkaido instead of connecting flights was a bit of a hasdle having to pick up our luggages clear immigration before heading to the domestic terminal and i wish that the airlines website could be more user friendly the look and feel seems a bit dated for a reputable airline fare was affordable and i managed to get a good price even though i booked my tickets quite last minute no doubt jal is the best economy class airlines,5
i only have limited time to bag drop and there was no specific counter to bag drop for me running with rushing travelling is really not comfortable connecting flight without check through is the problem due to rushing from international airport to domestic flight i dont even have a meal and the flight only serving the drink without a snack,3
night flight to tokyo for next morning taking the domestic flight to hokkaido the leg room and space between the seat are big enough the food is ok and miso soup only available from sg to tkyo and not available in return trip the screen is high resolution and big the service is good but not outstanding things as i expected before taking jal,4
overall experiencejust average check in process was clumsy on line didnt work due to tech issues airport check in was complicated and had to provide ticket number even with confirmed flight i sat on the business seat was comfortable but old side of my seat was taped up very shabby ordered japanese meal even i was on the bulk head and ordered meal early minute later flight attendant told me they ran of japanese meal i guess japanese guests have priority over nonjapanese very discriminatory but not surprising entertainment system is average but big screen wifi connection was good other carriers had better headphones no usb changing option tentative service throughout the flight on demand meal was ok flight crew was friendly but seems very routine and decent selection of drinks i am not sure if i would fly jal again since so many other carriers fly to japan now overall good flight with good service but nothing that stands out against other asian carriers,3
we travelled direct lhr tokyo haneda with children superb service from the start with excellent food round the clock see below with drinks and snacks and much more as and when required the hr flight felt like a few hours no jet lag both ways excellent cabin crew standards flight smooth no issues with taking off or landing etc excellent entertainment system check in very quick and efficient haneda airport excellent clean and organised would recommend this airline and will use it again before others hope this info is passed on to all staff who work for jal as they should be very proud of the customer service delivered only criticism is the vegetarian food on the return flight and the confusion between what is suitable for vegetarians eg rice crackers häagen dazs also the gluten free and vegetarian meals were identical and the puddings were not as nice as the meat meals,5
flight was delayed and they informed us straight away provided vouchers good boarding schedule very clean aircraft very good entertainment and staff were great food was great will fly with them again,5
i travel often between usa and the asia region and have had a few opportunities to take flight with jal member of the oneworld alliance i purposely chose jal over other air carriers serving between tokyonarita airport and taipei taoyuan intl airport due to the positive experiences i had onboard its flights from the time i was at the checkin counter to the time i waited at the gate for boarding and the use of its airport lounge i observed that everything was carried out in orderly fashions by its highly trained professional and courteous staff there was hardly any rush or chaotic moments observed at the jal boarding gate area in one occasion i observed in icn seoul the jal staff workers were waiting behind the checkin counter for the clock to strike noon the scheduled time to open immediately after the clock reached they all stood up bowed to the queued passengers first and then started serving them i was very impressed how much staff workers take their jobs seriously my experiences with their services onboard have been extremely pleasant as well for each flight i had taken whether i was sitting in the main cabin or in the business class cabin i was treated like a vip flight attendants always use both hands to offer their service items and then bow and thank you before they move on to their next tasks in some occasions the flight attendants even got down from their standing positions to talk to me while i was sitting for paying attention to the details they kept themselves very busy offered service items and checked frequently for the comforts of each passenger onboard they checked and cleaned up the lavatory after each passenger has used it they folded and shaped beginning roll of toilet paper to pointed down triangle and prepared the facility for the next user the choices of the foods served are always at the high standards and presentations are elegant and artful in my own opinion the levels of the customer services the professionalism and the attention to details by jal are almost flawless there are many ways to run a good business jal certainly knows the most important element is not about how to make profits but rather about how to provide utmost services to the travelers who choose and trust the company tripadvisors reviewers picked jal as the travelers choice award for many good reasons but most of all is its commitment to serve at the highest satisfaction level it has earned customers loyalty and reputations by ways of perfecting its services i salute to jal for earning tripadvisors prestigious award and felt honored to have been served by its flight crew and ground crew several times in the past months,5
ive travelled this route many times with jal but noticed that the service and hospitality has slipped they now employ thai cabin crew who are not as well trained gracious nor are they as attentive as the japanese many times i wished theyd pick up my meal tray so i could readsleep or just move about they did not make any special arrangements for our child no childs meals were offered you have to prebook them nor was there anything given to the child to make her journey more interesting no colouring book and pencils on this flight our entertainment system didnt work and my husbands tray wouldnt fold away as the flight was full he could not change seats poor maintenance having travelled this route many times ive been looking forward to a menu change its always japanese or western but with very little choice in either style i crave a change nevertheless their flight schedule saved the day ive never known an airline to leave late yet manage to arrive early every time,2
i have flown japan airlines for more than times and never had a bad experience professional and courteous i would prefer japan airlines every time i fly to south east asia,5
after flying jal from manila to tokyo then tokyo to dallas the next day all i can say is outstanding coach is as good as first class on some other airlines good food leg room and friendly flight attendants i will always check with jal before choosing a flight again they can be a bit more expensive but it might be is worth it if it isnt too much more,5
from the preflight bow by the crew before they boarded the plane till the final thank you jal manages to provide a level of service that is incomparable in the contemporary world so many airlines could learn lessons from this organization the level of courtesy professionalism and polish of the cabin crew is simply beyond par,5
i was very impressed with japan airlines knowing i had at long flight ahead of me i did a lot of research and was very pleased with my choice the counter staff both in the us and japan were extremely courteous and friendly actually i can say that for all the jal staff i encountered at the end of the flight the flightstaff came and thanled each passenger for choosing jal two meals and a handful of snacks were very adequate and filling the meals were served warm and fresh with a good assortment of dishes the flight entertainment system had recently been upgraded a good selection of videos both new and classics games tv radio there was a usb plug for charging and a few pockets to hold charging items the seats were comfortable enough good leg room and cushion,5
i flew in economy while my wife and young daughter flew in business class the airline staff were not attentive at all as compared to cathay or ba service when my wife asked for milk for our child she was given a quarter cup of milk when she requested more she as it wasnt nearly enough she was told there was a shortage of milk which i found quite unbelievable although the majority of flight attendants were smiling and very helpful the senior attendants noted by their brown jackets seemed jaded and completely disinterested and provided the bare basics when it came to customer service i must add that the check in was smooth and efficient also the boarding procedure was just as smooth and efficient the best part of the experience was the new dream liner its a fine plane and the journey was quick and smooth the return flight was the most disappointing aspect of our three week trip to japan where we had amazng experiences in tokyo kyoto and osaka amazing sights and sounds and great customer service next time we will fly air nippon,3
this airline is doing so many things right but for someone with a decidedly western palate like myself and my kids the food is just inedible we had an overnight stopover in narita en route to helsinki checkin on both outbound and return flights was very good staff were polite and efficient again on the plane staff very friendly and efficient i do wish they would have considered walking the isles offering coffee more than once on all flights the coffee was almost impossible to getother times it was only offered down one isle and not the other plenty of green tea on all flights though so again i am maybe a bit out of step with expectations as for the food the first regular meal out of australia was ok the others on all the flights were almost impossible to eat my kids have eaten the food on thai but they refused this food they were almost without food for the duration of two hour flight and the same happened on the way back please drop the rice burger it does not even sound like a good idea and surprisethe vegetarian meal was also refused and when i tasted it i must admit it was quite inedibly awful i admit i didnt dare to taste everything on the vegetarian meal because it either looked or smelt foul i tried to pick up some snack for the kids from the free basket they have on offer how wrong can you go with potato chips right well they tasted dried fish entertainment system is reasonable and quite standard better than finnair but not as good as emirates i was once told my a professional in the airline industry to never expect anything from the entertainment system so to plan on something else and to bring my own food best advise ever jal does a good job of getting you from a to b and they have nice staff the overnight stop over worked out well staff ask you at checkin whether you require your bags for the stopover bus transfer is easy to find hotel checkin is quick the only draw back is that all the three restaurants in the marroad hotel have very japanese food surprise and not of the kind easily identifiable by naive westerners it maybe would have been ok if they could explain the menu but as nice and demonstrably helpful as they were they did not speak a word of english between them i was looking for japanese ramennoodlemiso soups japanese rice bowls of some kind gyoza sushi sashimi this left it very hard to satisfy three kids for dinner i did still appreciate the stopover and the chance to sleep in a bed needless to say we skipped breakfast my nerves were just not ready to find out what we would get i would fly jal again but would then take some sandwiches the overnight stopover and the full day return flight stopover makes it worth it japan is really such a nice place with the loveliest most helpful people and they actually have very nice food as long as you can avoid anything that is not to your taste of course the airport has a wonderful free stopover program with guides that will help you our guide really went over and above and made the stopover a really nice experience,3
i hadnt used jal for years i am star alliance kind of person however there is no ana flight from chitose to hanamaki so no choice they have comfortable leather seats and free inflight movie i actually enjoyed it,4
this was my second time flying with jal to japan awesome as always arrival time and departure time are super accurate the airliner was great and there was wide leg room even in economy class the seat was comfortable inflight entertainments food and services are great too the domestic flight from handea tokyo to kansia osaka has free wifi the crews are very friendly and they are always ready to help you the price are very reasonable for full services airlines,4
amazing service at counter at the haneda airport had requested a wheelchair in advance but didnt expect one while just checking insuch fast and courteous service they even upgraded us to their lounge which in haneda is a real treat thank you jal for the amazing service,5
bottom line this is another example of an airline company caring more about making money than making happyrepeat customers long story short i work in south east asia and travel back and forth from the states often on my last trip back to america my family and i used jal japan airlines for our round trip tickets they seem to have good reviews and ok prices so my family gave them a shot everything went well on the trip to the states but on the return flight we had a family emergency that cause us to move our flight back one month when i called jal to see what the fee would be to move my flight i was told that because of their policy we would be charged almost the same amount as our round trip tickets of course our family didnt have the budget for that so i spent the week on the phone with their slow customer service team after speaking to multiple managers it became clear my bestcheapest option was to cancel our jal tickets and only get our taxes back from the thousands we spent on the round trip i was forced to book new one way tickets for my whole family with a new airline company just to get back to my job i wont be using jal again,1
it was very pleasure flight with jal new dreamliner with high quality sistems on board such as windows automatic curtains movie ans sound system light control our seats were in economy class but they were as in normal business class wide and comfortable all inside is very clean we had food and beverages on board and always it is possible to ask about drinks or food more if you need service and staff are perfect they helped us with all our questions i was with my son yo and he could choose presents from jal company i recommend jal for everyone,5
seats were very comfortable almost simple but functional you can lay completely flat for sleeping pillows are very big and comfortable and very nice blankets amenity kit is a case designed by zero hali burton with the basics inside you also get a por of slippers screen is large a good however the movie tv selection was very limited service was very polite and informative menu delicately crafted seafood options were very good vegetarian meal was also great they have a special international coffee program and the wine and liquor selection was outstanding japan airlines in my opinion is still not as good as singapore air or cathay pacific but still better than most other asian airlines and way superior to american airlines,4
excellent service from checkin to deboarding the cabin crew were not only beautiful but were polite friendly and professional the food was standard fare for an airline seats were comfortable premium economy is equal to what used to be business class foot rests slippers eye masks noise reduction headsets etc makes a hour flight bareable jal does all the little things that add comfort as much as possible food and drink service are almost constant even complementary toothbrushes in the lavatories i will never fly on any international flight that is not an asian carrier,5
this was a very comfortable flight and the service was very good the flight crew were very attentive and helpful the meal service was good as was the beverage service in flight entertainment was excellent warm towels were a nice touch,5
just flew in from jfk to nrt on jal i was very impressed with the professional and caring flight attendants the fight was very comfortable in the suites and tge service was great the attendants had a very busy flight and always maintained a comforting smile and a welcoming attitude i highly recommend this airline,5
we booked coach premium for a little more leg room but we couldnt select seats on outbound until we arrived at the airport this may have been because we booked thru american airlines the alliance partner aa gave us the run around and we couldnt get thru to jal to speak to a person directly and and reserve seats we did both end up with aisle seats which we needed for hour flight but we were in the back of the plane other than that snafu would highly recommend jal the service was great,5
flew japan airline jal from tokyos haneda airport to kagoshima airport the flight was very clean and looked new as a south african i am so used to getting snacks on board but only juice was offered during the h mins flight the crew were friendly my destination was tanegashima island we connected via japan airline commuter air for a minute flight to tanegashima,4
being a cm i always have legroom issue and first time traveling on japan airlines i was surprise to experience my knees not touching the back of the seat in front of me service and fb lived up to japanese standard which is always excellent highly appreciated is mini bottled wine which prevent spill having limited space rather than on a cup little wasteage is better than required intensive cleaning plus time constraint on air plane definitely will fly with japan airlines again,5
the toughest part about the flight was getting seat assignments they dont open up the option until to hours prior to the flight cant remember exact timing my son and i were flying to the usa on american through narita american code shares with jal we got all our seat assignments months in advance when we booked our tickets but jal doesnt allow it they dont have an office in singapore i call their toll free number and told must wait very s onboard it was a great flight and good staff,4
checkin was a breeze handled very quickly and efficiently they were offering an upgrade from economy to premium economy for an extra a which we took them up on we werent disappointed generous luggage allowance for checked luggage bagssuitcases kilograms each service was great very friendly and professional excellent food drink comfortable and roomy seats noise cancelling headphones a big bonus bathrooms very wellmaintained and clean no request was too little or too great air hostesses walked and checked the aisles and passengers on a regular basis,5
having flown business class on several airlines jal is a solid choice the service is good and their s are incredibly comfortable the meals are enjoyable and visually appealing,4
omg friends have told me to pay the extra and fly jal i did and dont regret it at all having flown nearly every major domestic airline i can confidently say that they are all a joke first the food the food they served me in economy is better than first class meals ive had flying domestically the food that was served on jal was tasty and fresh it also looked good which is something that is hard to do second the service attentive and pleasant third the flight attendants were all dressed impeccably and anyone that has flown on international airlines knows what im talking about us airlines cant compare fourth the seats are more comfortable and even have footrests what the heck when was the last time domestic airlines thought about a small thing like that oh i forgot they dont give a crap about their customers because theyve got a captured market fifth no fees yup domestic airlines continue to rip customers off with fees but not jal i think domestic airlines dont charge either for international flights but thats only because they probably wouldnt be able to complete if they did sixth i cant confirm but i swear they handle baggage with care not a single ding on my suitcase seventh cost about the same as it would have cost me to fly to the west coast or vegas id rather go to japan no tipping save food in general cheaper and you wont find crappy food in japan eighth clean the entire plane was clean even the bathrooms this was my first time to japan but not my last ill definitely consider jal again or ana or korean air or pretty much any airline that isnt us based,5
i fly to japan often and this trip was the roomiest most comfortable and best served of any level of economy it probably helped that it was a a fantastic plane to fly in i was in k first row bulkhead of premium economy the leg room is enormous i could get out without disturbing the aisle passenger plenty of overhead bin space is available this is important when sitting at the bulkhead the seat was wide and comfortable the service was precise polite and attentive what you would expect in japan the food is good and nicely but efficiently presented teas and all other manner of drinks are offered throughout the flight overall a great travel experience and introduction to japan the flight departed almost an hour late due to late arriving plane we ended up landing within minutes of schedule so there effectively was no delay i received an email and message a few hours before the flight informing me of the delay and apologizing when i checked in for the flight entered the sakura lounge to wait was waiting at the gate lounge and upon boarding announcement apologies were given for the late departure once seated the flight attendant addressed me by name to apologize for the delay yes the service is that good,5
i love this flight the seat and the crew was spotless although i am reviewing based on a business class seat i have tried enough business class seats to know that this was one of the best i have flied on before flying they give you these eye masks and earplugs and they also have slippers on the seats which you can take home leg room perfect it even has a little area off to the end of your foot for those like me who dont want to put their bags on the carry on over head space this plane has a lot of space from little nooks to stick your phone while charging to the little side cabinet youll have where you can stick your bulky headphone case or sleeping masks or whatever it is as long as its within kg youre good food food is good all through out i ate the japanese style and my only problem there is that i did not know that the wrapped cube was my rice i thought it was dessert or something and i was finished with my food before i knew that the wrapped thing was my rice drinks they were very generous with drinks i have been on flights where they dont give you a bottle of water so you dont have to feel bad calling for them whenever youre in the middle of the flight they were abundant with coffee and tea as well staff these ladies were super helpful my uncles cane got stuck under the seat and these ladies were very helpful to the point that they had to remove all of the seats padding just to be able to reach under it restroom toothbrushes and mouthwash i love these since i forget to bring my own when i go to the restroom my only problem flight home from our layover tokyo manila for some reason the air condition was really hot and i mean sweaty hot but overall would recommend again i am reviewing based on business class seats do not take my word if you are flying economy,5
i have had some very difficult asiaus flights as far as jet lag often taking over two weeks to recover but finally found one that had minimal impact on me jals nonstop flight from tokyo to boston which leaves at p japan time and also lands at p eastern time what solves the problem is the departure and landing times it leaves at p and a good meal is served not too long after takeoff which makes it easy to fall asleep by p or so tokyo time which is a boston time this allows for a good hours of sleep by which time a breakfast meal is served which is around p boston time that leaves just a little more flight time before landing at p in boston this is absolutely perfect as youre then tired by p boston time so that you can go to bed at a regular time though i definitely was a bit tired over the next few days i never had the annoying issue of incessantly waking up at strange times once i was back i highly recommend this flight jal has solved the jet lag problem as far as im concerned,5
the business class on this flight was fairly empty but with the design of the all isle access cabin full flatbed and kind of suite design one of best business class seats i ever had the service was nice and friendly,5
this was the st time we use japan airline we were couple one child years old a kind of disappointed there was only one kind of meal which you have no choice st time ever compare to many others airline in our years travel poor meal in order the taste the quality the worst meal ever in the plane of us only eat of the meal we force ourself to eat more as the flight was hours from singapore to tokyo then transit to memanbetsu hokkaido even the snack also no good my son always like snack he dont want to eat the snack after one bite we try to find a restaurant in tokyo when return trip back to singapore as i know that we will get hungry in the plane the smaller blanket ever in the plane which only can cover upper body we try not to take japan airline in future even the service was good but the meal was important for long flight thanks for the vote if you found this helpful d,3
absolutely without a doubt the best airline to flight to japan super clean cosy great food responsive and attentive flight attendants definitely recommend,4
it was our first flight on jal for long haul route from los angeles to tokyo check in and boarding were fast and agents were very courteous the cabin was very clean seats were wider than others and leg room was good for my long legs food was decent and the crew offers a lot of drinks during the flight the passengers were very quiet i have never had a flight so quiet all in all it was a great trip definitely will fly with them again,5
bad mistake by jal staff meant that we had to change to earlier flight to catch connecting flight staff at chitose airport was a helpful but language was a struggle,3
our first trip to japan to visit our son stationed in yokosuka naval base we tried consistently to find a good fare looking at alot of flights we finally found a decent fare on jal we flew economy over and got the chance to upgrade to premium economy for the return for a minimal charge the flight over was very nice with a fair amount of room for economy the premium was really nice plenty of room and with the reclining seats and leg extension it was really nice the attendants were courteous attentive and very helpful definitely plan to fly with them again,5
the seats for the flight from singapore to tokyo was hard uncomfortable with limited decline they only serve one meal without any choice the flight from tokyo to new york was much better with soft and bigger seats there were more meal choice on this flight too ive been around and i must applaud japanese for their neat laundry usage and quietness they did the right thing to include lots of travel and food shows introducing their country this is good marketing strategy to entice and educate their foreign passengers,4
flew with them for ultra long haul route from new york to hong kong via narita check in was smooth with friendly and courteous check in agent boarding process was calm and very orderly our b was almost brand new and immaculate seats were comfy and had lots of leg rooms meals and snacks were pretty decent and crews make water and juice runs every min or so to keep the passengers hydrated all in all excellent trip i think they are almost same level as ana but ana seems to have cabin crews that are a bit more cheery and enthusiastic north american carriers have a lot to learn from these high quality asian airlines,5
its a relief to be treated courteously and even pampered a little on a long flight the other guys occasionally rise to the occasion but sometimes live up to their what do you want mac hostile reputations never on jal too bad they dont fly everywhere,4
my flight today took minutes with jal its not just the flight is the greeting at checkin the genuine feel that you are really either the only person on the plane or someone special today was my third jal flight since by far one of the best j class experience hard to beat jal,5
we flew economy from sydney to tokyo and had quite a pleasant journey it seemed like a new plane and everything was clean and in working order there also seemed to be more than usual leg room the ability to darken the tint of the window rather than having to pull the shade up or down also gave greater options the food was decent,4
jal dont have their own lounge at heathrow so use british airways which is a fairly standard issue business class lounge so nothing to write home about and a fairly ordinary start to a first class flight if you have one world emerald then id advise using cathay pacific first lounge which is very good and you can get a good sit down meal at boarding was a bit of a scrum with everyone diving at the gate once an announcement was made so no real separation for firstbusiness on board the cabin was very nice and secluded it felt like we were the only ones on the plane which was great and the seat had a phenomenal amount of space service was very attentive throughout however only one of the cabin crew spoke english well enough to understand any questions which caused issues with the food for my wife the bed was very comfortable as was the seat with lots of space and the tv screen was massive despite being quite a way from you the bose full noise cancelling headphones were also excellent the mattress was very comfortable but with the pyjamas made it quite hot as the cabin temperature was high on this flight so i didnt sleep that well due to being uncomfortable food and drinks offering for me were superb and i had the japanese menu which was great as well as a couple of the wines sake and suntory year old which i tried my wife had issues with the food as we had call in advance to book her meal due to dietary requirements which had been noted as the fa came and check with her at the start of the flight about them but not taken into account for example she cant eat fish which they acknowledged but then they brought out the starter of lobster subsequently she didnt each much at all which was a shame they also didnt have any flexibility to find food from another cabin that she could eat so we were disappointed with that part of the service she had the same issues with breakfast i tried the al a carte and had a couple of things which were nice and brought very quickly the attentiveness of the staff is indeed good but their flexibility or ability to deal with anything non standard is not i felt that like other airlines they should have more of the senior staff in this cabin rather than junior member all senior were serving business on our flight the arrival was very good and the flight overall was comfortable and the nice surroundings made the long flight time fly by the pyjamas and amenity set by porsche were very good the snack bar well i say bar every time you got up to get anything from it the attendants dived up and got it for you was good the best bit about the cabin is the exclusive part of it on this flight it had seats full but i felt as if i barely saw another passenger the whole flight it was very quiet and nice and relaxing downside was the food for my wife who had fairly simple not overly fussy dietary requirements which for the cost of the ticket id expect jal to cater for especially as we called in advance to let them know,4
outstanding customer care polite efficient flight attendants they found out it was our wedding anniversary and came up with a gift in flight we travel a lot and these were the most uncomfortable plane seats of my life cramped my knees touched the seat in front of me i am of average height very narrow seats,3
one of the most pleasant flights i have ever taken was japan airlines great plane with good seating and the crew was absolutely the nicest and most professional i have had the pleasure to observe best flight ever,5
amazing experience super good excellent service and very luxurious best business class i have traveled by far,5
i often dread a longhaul flight in any other class than business but then i traveled to japan with jal i cashed in my avios points to experience the premium economy service to tokyo and the whole experience was just a few minor points off being excellent so ill focus on what those minor points was because everything else really was excellent check in at jfk despite checking in online the check in at jfk seemed a little chaotic with the line snaking all the way back to the entrance when i arrived there was no clear signage or staff on hand to ask for assistance in determining where the bag drop line was so i stood in line for at least minutes before deciding to break out of the line at the risk of losing my place as i was traveling alone to find a member of staff the bag drop line was then pointed out to me it was totally clear the signage had been blocked by fellow passengers standing in orderly single file i guess my first exposure to the japanese queueing my bag was checked in and marked with a priority label the lounges this for me was the big benefit of traveling premium economy with jal you get full access to the lounge air frances lounge at jfk and the jal flagship lounge at narita at narita i took a shower before boarding the hour flight back ny which felt really decadent seat the jal sky premium seat is excellent this is a very well designed product fully adjustable footrest power holder for a full bottle of water great seat slide privacy screen great width and lots of legroom comfortable enough for me to sleep both on the way to and from tokyo and the best thing about it is that the seat in front does not recline into your space i couldnt offer an improvement here service including fb the incabin service was flawless with ample food and beverage being served or being made available throughout the flight all of a very good standard where a minor point gets deducted is in that some passengers with totally western palates may feel as though the options are limited entertainment this was the only average thing about the flight for me and is the only area that i felt was lacking but the plus side was that a lack of great entertainment meant that i had no option but to sleep and sleep in that great seat was easily forthcoming i intend to travel back to japan and this airline will definitely be my first choice for my return trip,5
everything was just perfectbest flight attendants i have ever seen great food new airplane good entertainment ecc,5
deciding which airline to take when going to japan or asia jal is the airline of choice yes we are seating coach class but the service tho is excellent or star whatever you ask they will provide it for you and the flight attendants walk the aisles every min to make everyone are comfortable when booking jal flight please make sure its not an american airline codeshare flight please dont fly american the service is not as good as jal american airline flight attendants just plain lazy and not very accommodating to everyone its just my opinion hope this help when deciding airline to fly to asia safe travels,5
our first time travelling with this airline and it will be my first choice next time we head to japan again long queues at haneda due to many travelers checking in various airlines from one set of counter plane had surprisingly enough leg room for my tall husband and seats were comfortable in flight staff were beautifully groomed friendly and very gracious food was very tasty and had my favourite sake to drink food and drinks kept coming throughout the flight in flight entertainment was great and all inclusive overall this has to be my favourite airline to fly with and would definitely recommend japan airline,5
jal is one of my top choice airline attendants are attentive and food is good moreover economy seat has more leg space you can check in up to kgs of luggage this time highly recommended,5
japan airlines has one of the widest seats and longest leg rooms in economy class their economy class may be even better than some premium economy class of other airlines the service was great and really fast the food although not up to par with business class quality made up for it in quantity entree salad rice crackers appetizer fruits ice cream for dessert miso soup their inflight meal was very filling as for entertainment their screens were fairly big and the choices were sufficient for the trip as a bonus japan airlines offers kg baggage allowance vs kg baggage allowance for others overall japan airlines is one of the most comfortable flights and i would highly recommend its economy class for short or even long haul flights,5
the seats were very comfortable plenty of room to stretch out and places to put things i preordered the japanese meal and it was delicious service was efficient and friendly movie selection was moderate the music selection for a baby boomer s and s fan was awful nothing i could find to listen to,4
we flew on the first flight of the day to tokyo from manila the staff were very polite and accommodating throughout the flight process and made us feel very welcoming the food was surprisingly good with a good selection of dishes and a welcome break from the usual fare on flights the flight was on time and very smooth throughout definitely on the preferred list of airlines from now on,5
my friend passed the immigration very smoothly but it took me to get out more than an hour we cannot find any reason to divide us,4
absolutely fabulous booked business class with my aa miles and the service food flat bed seat and entertainment were one of the best he flight attendants are very friendly and accommodating we also flew economy with jal and the service is excellent,5
all i can say is wow the ladies are the most amazing ladies you would never know that we were on a hour flight always a smile always helpful and always caring the head stewardess her name began with a t touched my heart she was so kind i can see why the other ladies are good the pilots were smooth flying again if going to japan fly japan air we were returning home from japan on the rd flight jl at pm,5
i really enjoy going jal now to europe when i was younger i just wanted to get there but now cant wait to get out at narita and sleep in a bed and coming back four hours at the airport is great to get out have a shower and something to eat the staff are always friendly and helpful i had to rearrange my flight dates and it wasnt a problem to do that for me the food is okay normal airline food but got upstairs seating last time which was great,5
i am frequent flier with history of over a million miles flown jal was excellent i brought along my elderly mother which they accommodated with wheelchair service when we arrived to await the jal check in counter to open the agents and their manager formally greeted the passengers in line announced they were open and thanked us for flying jal with a bow was so humbling and grateful once checked in we were taken to the jal lounge and the lounge was well set up with shower facilities sandwiches pastries soups salad curry rice etc in the back of the lounge they offered asian foods dumplings noodles veggies rice great assortment and choices drinks included juices coffee wine beer soft drinks variety of multiple language newspapers with a nice window view of the airplanes when it was time to depart the jal agent came and drove us on the little golf cart to the gate jal had already reserved special seats in front of gate for wheelchair passengers ive not seen this with other airlines once we preboarded the plane was and spacious offered slippers warm cloth first class kit casual jacket to change into newspapermagazines two meal services snacks movieaudio and headsets when your plane pulls from the gate to takeoff the ground crew are lined up and all bow to the plane and wave choice of western or japanese meals on menu japanese meals were excellent presentation and deliciousmy husband gave the staff several boxes of hawaiian chocolate macadamia candy each of the flight attendants walked over and personally thanked us and in return a gift bag of japanese snacks and personalize written thank you card we were so relaxed and enjoyed our long flight the restroom was spacious and provided toothbrushes and mouth wash jal really know how to provide customer service and we will definitely be flying again,5
this was a great airline especially if you are travelling to india the service is always so friendly and kind the staff always have a smile of their face and always address to any issues you may have flights from yvr to delhi usually have a overnight stay complimentary from jal i stayed in nikko narita and it was a fairly good hotel with a full breakfast in the morning when we reached delhi we were fresh and werent as tired as we usually are when we take different airlines,5
japan airlines is professional their employees treat customers with the utmost respect the old mantra the customer is always right rings true with them customer service is excellent from predeparture to inflight service to arrival you even get little house slippers for the long flight food was very good flight attendants very attentive and pleasant,5
for many years i had heard of japan airlines exemplar service but our experience fell short i would describe the service as inconsistent and the onboard cuisine was average a hour flight should give the flight attendants enough time to offer you more than glass of wine during dinner service we received significantly better service and cuisine on our south african airlines flight from johannesburg to washington dc,3
my wife and i flew to and from narita airport from jfk recently our carrier japan air was excellent the flight both to and from japan were ontime the air crew were friendly very professional and available throughout our flights even though our flights were long hours each way our time onboard went by rather quickly meals drinks and snacks were provided throughout we were even able to get some sleep each way to ease the jetlag we both experienced the plans were clean and comfortable i would recommend japan air to anyone requiring travel to and from japan,5
i flew to japan quite often recently and most of the time i flew with japan airline the flight timing is perfect the service is exceptional and the seat is comfortable one of the plus is that there are thai flight attendants on board every time highly recommended,5
in my opinion the best first class overall checkin and lounge were both wonderful service seat and foodbeverage are all topnotch other than some language barrier flight attendants are extremely friendly and helpful only things that were average would be the inflight entertainment options and sometimes the cabin temperature too warm,5
clean orderly fast if youre flying for the first time in japan please note that they board the plane very very quickly dont break the rules and come up and board when it is not your time they simply scan bar codes nobody checks your tickets they sit down quickly no fussing minutes to board a big seat plane,4
jal remain my first choice of airline especially if i travel to japan in flight service is good and food was great recently they also made some some enhancement to their food menu which bring the in flight food to a greater quality the last recent flight i was travelling with my year old son this is my first time travelling with baby with jal everything is good and bassinet is comfy for baby,5
spacious seat and comfortable enough for flying longhaul superfriendly and agile flight attendants tasty food and beverages clean lavatory various inflight entertainments and newspapers overall service is very good value for money i would definitely recommend jal,5
extremely clean cabin and free beverages are good jal boeing has perhaps the best available legroom for economy classes and meals were definitely superior over korean air both ground and flight crews were very kind and responsive and landing was one of the smoothest ive experienced seat comfort was actually better in older jal planes where recaro seats were fitted in another drawback jal does not have its own appat least in english and self checkin must be done through jal website only also boarding passes cannot be downloaded to wallet app in iphone,5
my family and i really had a nice experience flying with jal from jakarta to narita and returned to jakarta on the th day of our holiday trip onboard meals were good accompanied with wine,5
economy pitch is never great but this was of the inch type so tolerable our check in was quick and some care was taken to meet our requests we managed to have a three to our own flight was on time both ways and food was tolerable only real choice for nonstops and we needed to be in narita for starting our vacation,4
spur of the moment trip could not have been happier some economy seats were on the upper deck we asked if it was possible to have seats with better legroom they were so accommodating unlike others who fob you off with excuses which turn out to be untrue included was an overnight stop in japan we were able to check in and get our boarding passes at the hotel they gave us snacks to nibble on whilst in the hotel lovely experience this trip was taken in i couldnt put that in below wish they went to more places from australia,5
very roomy and comfortable inside of cabin very polite hostes meal was excellent i had best flight i ever had,5
we fly back and forth from san diego to narita once a year as we live there part of the time flying direct from san diego to narita saves us about hours in total as our only other option is to fly via los angeles for anyone who has had the most unpleasant experience of flying via lax you can appreciate why we would not want to do that and put up with the abuse that you experience at that airport rude surly hostile tsa customs and immigration staff there by contrast san diego is a breeze you are treated with respect and courtesy and the time to get through is a quantum less than lax jals food is better than average for an airline and while not as plush as it was a few years back the buffet at narita in the premium section is still good,5
good service good meal the general one great movie selection with translation to different languages was no wifi on this plane very comfortable time pm the seats are just ok,5
i had the chance to fly with japan airlines last april and i would say it has been one of my best economy class experiences ever first of all i dont think i ever saw of one the cabin crew members without a smile they were amazingly nice during the whole flight the cabin was clean the legroom was larger than what you can usually find and the on board meals were very good they even offered miso soup before every mealtime i would definitely fly with them again,4
we had wonderful flights back from bangkok to toronto with japan airlines all their seats have really great legroom the plane was not too cold and all our electronics worked tv sound etc the bathrooms were all kept clean and they took our trash regularly the staff were all very polite and was able to speak english and japanese perfectly food on this airline was amazing compared to north american airlines that weve traveled with there was enough of each option for everyone and the food was delicious thank you for a lovely experience jal,5
even in economy class service is just fantastic attendants work nonstop offering beverages snacks etc and are extremely pleasant plane is immaculate with surprisingly a lot of space for economy class decent international movie selection overall a wonderful experience for a very interesting price american carriers should send mystery shoppers to learn,5
our first time on japan airlines impressive easy and attentive checkin and boarding was fairly organized cabins were clean and kept clean throughout the flight flight attendants were helpful and pleasant seats in premium economy are far better than the same level of service on other airlines with almost pitch instead of a dinner and snack prior to arrival they served two full meals both of which were tasty remember this is airline food at and filling and plenty of alcohol was available we departed on time and landed on time what more could you ask for these days in flight entertainment was meh and the lounge at sfo was less than stellar although the lounge at haneda was excellent would not hesitate to flight japan airlines again,5
service standards impeccable but the vegetarian food offered was indifferent to put it mildly perhaps the japanese cant understand why anyone except monks would opt for vegetarian food when there are so many western and japanese meat options while the usual business class trappings are amply provided the storage in the window seat is minimal much better in the aisle seat furthermore my entertainment system didnt work,4
i fly to ho chi minh city for work periodically and the ultimate route is jal and on the way back jal flying premium economy the numbers refer to the loooooooooong flight hours between boston and tokyo premium economy seats are not much more than regular economy if you upgrade at the airport and well worth it though even the economy seats are pretty good since this route uses the gigantic dreamliner planes on this trip you leave boston at about pm eat a big meal a couple of ours after takeoff and either sleep or watch movies or work for the next hours then they feed you again then you land in tokyo a comfortable hour layover and then on to ho chi minh city you land at about pm hcmc time by which time your system is mixed up enough and traveling has been tiring enough that going to bed when you get to your destination is just right jal service is terrific the flight crew is lovely i like the food a lot especially the ice cream the wifi is the best ever i always use it for work and its never failed me totally unlike the lame gogo inflight nonsense on us domestic flights,5
this was a pleasant surprise as we didnt expect too much from an economy class flight the food was excellent service very pleasant polite frankly we couldnt fault anythingwe took off and arrived exactly as scheduled boardng and seating was smooth and efficient highly recommend this airline,5
after eating some rice that i was served special vegan meal i noticed it had a chemical like smell taste it was supposed to be plain white rice with a little saffron although it had no hot spices in it my mouth tongue throat started feeling hot i notified the flight attendant about it she suggested that i drink a lot of liquids to flush out what i had been served but the symptoms got worse after they returned my plane ticket which they requested the head of the flight attendant spoke to me i was told to stay after the plane landed they had me talk to a man who took me aside said this could not have happened the man acted arrogant i assured him that this was the last thing i needed or wanted but he just walked away acted like business as usual he said i would hear from them thru email surprise surprise i have not heard a word from them,1
as i was eating my rice which had no hot pepper for my special vegan meal i noticed a funny smell taste like some chemical disinfectant it was supposed to be plain white rice with supposedly a little saffron even after just a few mouthfuls of just the rice my mouth and tongue and throat started feeling hot and after a few minutes it felt like it was on fire i told the flight attendant after drinking an entire bottle of water when the burning feeling didnt go away she told me that i should keep on drinking liquids to try to flush this out of my systemi could not drink any hot tea because it made my mouth and throat feel worse so i drank another bottle of water my eyes started feeling irritated as well i was told to wait after the plane landed at sfo and a male im assuming a jal employee took me aside as i was walking on the ramp he immediately told me that this incident couldnt have happened but that he would have the rice tested that i would get an email from them i have not heard one word from them i could tell by his attitude that they would just deny what had happened i told the man that i didnt need or want this to happen but he just acted like he really did not care he just walked away acted like business as usual,1
japan airlines has good service and nice comfort for the business seats offering windows for one seat the food especially the bento box and the mattress you get to sleep on is nice as well,4
the business sets are arranged in an offset configuration with privacy screens that effectively give you a private suite each seat has access to the aisle so no stepping over people very ingenious layout the service was excellent the food was good and there is an ala carte menu that operates for the whole flight seat turns into a bed and they like air new zealand provide comforter mattresses which when laid on the flat seat make a very comfortable bed as opposed to the gaps and lumps of a flattened seat unlike a lot of airlines united polaris being the most uncomfortable the entertainment content was however somewhat limited a few new movies and not much else though there was an excellent large screen and great noise cancelling phones i will certainly fly them again,5
since so many airline reviews are negativeincluding some of my own i wanted to write a positive one for an airline which is exemplary i flew on the dreamliner from yvr to nrt in october roundtrip the sign that jal actually cares about their passengers is they are one of only a handful of airlines that followed the recommended seating arrangement in the plane most airlines greedily have shoved in making the cabin and aisles very cramped with the its really a nice inairplane economy environment especially combined with other dreamliner features my only real complaint with this craft is that the space in front of you was quite small and cramped especially if the person reclined i know jal has retrofit a lot of their planes with a larger economy seat and legroom so look to see if you can snag a route that has it if you fly them this plane wasnt updated just yet at the time so personal space was a bit tight the food was really solid for airline food as they basically prepared you a little bento meal with real silverware and little plastic boxes for each food service was good lots of extra teawatersoup if you wanted throughout the flight anyway if youre going to asia would absolutely recommend jal one of the few airlines left that actually cares about their passengers from top to bottom,5
i took a flight from hong kong to tokyo everyone i met was very nice everyone was polite everyone was smiling the flight was good seats were roomy and food was good i will try to fly them on longer trips from dallas to tokyo,5
after arriving at haneda airport last april we cleared customs and immigration and rechecked our bags with jal at the ground floor desk and were directed to another security checkpoint and then down to the ground where we caught an airport shuttle bus to the domestic terminal we then had to get to the farthest gate away from the bus station go figure and the plane to misawa japan eventually arrived and were boarded in less than minutes jal does not fool around when boarding folks everyone gets on and sits down right away with a minimum or folks trying to put bags in the overhead compartments in just a few minutes we were being pushed aaway from the gate and i watched the ground crew stand at attention and salute the pilots then wave at the passengers on the plane wow we were in the air in no time arriving at misawa was fun came in over the ocean to a one gate terminal on the air force base misaawa everyone deplaned in an orderly manner and in just a couple of minutes were were off of the plane talk about efficient our bags came in to the carousel in less than minutes and we were on our way to visit with family returning was even better we checked in at the desk where there were ladies working and our agent was able to give us boarding passes for the next flight but because of an equipment change in tokyo she could not do the boarding passes for that flight we went to the second floor and thru security in a breeze and sat down to wait about minutes later that same desk agent came up to me and said that she could now give us boarding passes for our remaining flights wow she had come upstairs past security to find us at the gate and then took our passports and paperwork with her back down to her desk and returned about minutes later with everything including the boarding passes holy cow thats just amazing we boarded again in less than minutes and as usual everyone sits down right away and buckles up and in no time were being pushed back from the gate again the ground crew stood at attention in the rain i might add and saluted the pilots and waved at the passengers i believe that the employees of jal are really happy people and they must really love their jobs their smiles and attitude is infectious we took off quickly and landed at haneda in tokyo after gathering our bags we took the airport shuttle to the international terminal and had to pass thru security and immigration again and then we sat down to wait for our flight this was a good time to get a bite to eat there were lots of places to get food there the airplane that had been scheduled to fly to la had a problem and they substituted an older model plane and it was just ok but not great every seat had a pillow and a blanket and headphones on it as we boarded this flight was full it was a red eye and i dont sleep on airplanes oh well service was excellent the food seemed to be never ending it was hot and tasty and the beverages free were easy to get when you asked for one there were toothbrushes available in the bathroom in cellophane so you could brush after eating ive never seen that on any other flight ive ever taken and again as usual all of the crew were smiling and seemed to be very happy so other than the less than super airplane on the flight from tokyo to la jal was tops id fly with them again in a heartbeat i actually booked my entire flight thru jal and they code shared with american airlines for portions of it phx to lax and then lax to tokyo and then from san francisco to phoenix everything else was on jal,4
from the moment we sat down we had been treated like we were in business class staff were very attentive and did their best to make us feel comfortable when my year old son cried due to the air pressure the staff came over couple of times making sure he was alright thank you for that we dont feel neglected moslem food were not that great but it was ok to keep us full,4
in total we took flights via jal in this trip the planes were all very clean there is always this natural smiles politeness from all the cabin crew food was good too fares reasonable too hallmarks of the beautiful japanese culture we have taken many airlines over the years in our opinion jal is one of the best,5
japan airlines used to be the first class airline with excellent meal and services but after they restructured they cut the flights and service became the rd class their service is getting worse and worse i would not recommend jal anymore for oneworld alliance i recommend american or cathy unless you take a business class which ok but aacx business are better overall jal needs to improve their profile the above flight was the worst sitting in the noisy cthey should not sell this seat when there are babies on board because both passengers with baby and without are suffering they should use exclusively for passengers with baby i asked purser to change my seat to give more room for baby and peace for me but she refused she doesnt care about the passengers wellbeingit is shame she as a senior crew she doesnt care about the passengers,1
we flew on japan airlines code shared with american airlaines from bangkok to tokyo in june the airplane was new the services were wonderful the staff were friendly the foods were delicious the entertainment system was excellent,5
regularly using jal for years and always fully satisfied with quality price and more than anywhere else japanese service since new dreamliner started operations on route moscowtokyo it became even better thanks to moscow office stuff i got connection to flight of another air company in tokyo cathay pacific but jal helped me to chek in luggage to final destination,5
jals quality of service has never diminished in any way i first flew with jal back in today their service is still exemplary they always go beyond and give that extra mile our flight was only hours but all kinds of drinks were provided food represents what japanese food is all about fas were always courteous and accommodating splendid indeed,5
it was our first time flying jal and the service was the best weve ever received on any airline the attendants are courteous and professional flights are ontime and the meals and extras are very nice on a long flight they make sure the bathrooms stay clean and fresh they regularly walk up and down the aisle with coffee tea juice or water all of it with a smile we will definitely fly jal again,5
id already done the hour dallas to narita flight and now was on the six hours narita to suvarnabhumi leg back to thailand i was stiff and my legs and back were aching so as the seat belt sign was off i got up and walked up and down the aisle a few times between all my sleeping fellow travellers a delightful thai flight attendant saw me doing leg stretches and asked me if i wanted a bamboo foot massage i had no idea what this was but went along with it it turned out to be a very simple device a piece of thick bamboo split horizontally to form a flat surface that was placed on the floor the flight attendant told me to step on the rounded surface with my toes then slowly move forward to the balls of my feet the soles then the heels and to keep repeating this for a few minutes holding onto the counter in the galley to steady myself it was amazingly effective almost like having an hourlong thai traditional foot massage many thanks to the thai flight attendant for making my trip so much more comfortable,5
i have flown jal twice so far on this trip tokyo hnd to nagoya and sapporo cts to tokyo hnd this time i chose j class the aircraft hndngo and ctshnd were impeccably clean the crew were very caring and helpful both flights departed on time and landed and arrived at the terminals on time i did have a choice of airlines on this trip but chose jl because i was curious about their service i was not disappointed well done jl thanks for looking after me,5
jal has a renovated lounge at bkk airport with much improved menu and it is also more spacious than the old one as always jal flight boarding and inflight services are courteous and customer focused the drinks and food menu is much better than other carriers on this route i am an american airlines executive platinum member however always look forward to flying on jal,4
this was our first and long overdue really longhaul flight so we wanted to have the best chance for comfort hence we used awards to get two f class seats and we are glad that we did thus our experience is only with the first class experience but we expect to use business class in the future one very special touch was that the flight attendants appeared to clean the restroom after every use in one case one of us went to use the toilet and someone else had just left and a flight attendant hurried over and asked that we wait a moment while she cleaned up needless to say this was the cleanest airline bathroom ever it was probably the cleanest bathroom weve ever encountered in a publicsemipublic space and airline bathroomstoilets are generally not known for their ongoing uh cleanliness as the flight continues yes f class has a lot of advantages but we wouldnt fly f without using awards given the cash price we had read that the shared f lounge at jfk left much to be desired and that was definitely true we havent flown jal outbound from japan we used cx so we cant speak for any f lounge in japan the food was quite good the flight attendants kindly arranged for us to share using the companion seat a noodle tasting with the types of noodles they also spent a bit of time helping to teach dh how to use chopsticks a bit better nice extra the f seatsbeds were great and that was a huge reason we chose f class in an attempt to get some sleep on such a long flight when we were younger we could have slept almost anywhere but no more we flew out of japan via hong kong on cathay as we wanted to compare the two f class products cx definitely has the more comfortable seatsbeds especially with the nice width otherwise both f classes provided a remarkably nice way to travel long haul and without awards the price would have been commensurately high well continue to save our awards for f class,5
this was a very expensive flight when i got on board i found out why a big plane almost empty of course we were well looked after this was jal after all and there was no real excuse for not doing it well with so few people on board left and arrived on time luggage turned up soon it actually took longer to get to akita airport on the airport bus than to fly to osaka,3
i took the first flight in the morning because it was the least expensive it still cost an enormous amount of money for a flight that took only about minutes jals service is legendary and on the basis of this flight its reputation is well deserved very pleasant check in smooth boarding nuts and juice elegantly presented not easy on such a small plane luggage deliverdd promptly the pilot woke us to tell us about the mountains we could see below and the flight attendant distributed panoramic views with the mountains named nice touch,4
flew nrtkul jun on transit from sapporo cts on jl as a frequent traveller this was my first time on japan airlines from the ground staff at the check in counter in cts to the gate managements staff and right through the cabin crew the service was nothing short of excellent they staff and crew member were all courteous polite helpful and so respectful a special mention to the crew of jljun from the moment i stepped in there was not a moment that the crew did not smile every passenger was treated equally regardless of your nationality or class of travel throughout the hour flight the crew were always visible vigilant and ready to attend to your requests the one thing that makes the jl crew stand out from the rest was the fact that their service was genuine and it definitely came from the heart they actually loved doing their job this i must say is a very rare sight on any airline the crew represented their nation their culture and their airline very well it represents a truly warm japanese hospitality the seats on the were comfortable food choice was also far better than any other economy class selection the inflight entertainment was awesome the crew also spoke english well enough for anyone to understand i have no complaints but instead i have nothing but praises for this airline its my first time on jl and will definitely not be my last this airline is highly recommended especially if you are travelling with children and elderly passengers its the small details that makes a huge difference,5
wow service is so much better than any of the us based airlines kudos jal food was average for an asian based airline,4
excellent flight and service seats are very nice the staff are the most helpful and friendly of all the aircraft ive been on bonus is that they offer free wifi on their plans too,5
flying is never exactly a comfortable experience but the jal plane seemed to have a little more space than some other airlines i have flown i think maybe the seats were very slightly wider or perhaps just a better design but very comfortable in any case the service is good and professional and the generous allowance for checked baggage allowed me to bring home plenty of souvenirs in general i find it best to pack light for japan but bring a suitcase to take home your holiday purchases,4
when booking online site doesnt tellalert you that connecting flight before return to la is to a domestic airport itami instead of international kansai you are responsible for schlepping your baggage and self for the transfer takes hours by bus costs approx yenpp just under we learned of this at checkin in haneda and tried in vain to be flown directly to kansai after minutes of discussion with supervisor of supervisor they finally said we could change to a direct flight to la from haneda at a cost of pp we said no and requested reimbursement of bus transfer costs but they refused will be writing to company if their website had made it clear that we were being sent to a domestic airport and would have to transfer ourselves to international one we wouldnt have booked that flight or that airline has anyone else had this experience with other airlines is this standard practice,3
to the seasoned traveler this will not be news but to the rookie it could be a life saver from san francisco sfo to tokyo haneda japan air lines jal flies a er that er means there is extra leg room the flight is hours and that extra inches soon becomes a blessing plus they have nice food and stewardess see also jal take it the rugged path on the hit seat popeye needed,5
i booked this and other legs of my flight to the usa on line many months ago and when i did so i paid extra for seating in the exit rows to give me extra leg room when i arrived at suvanabhumi international airport jal check in the ground crew had no record of me having made this payment and unfortunately i had only bought my eticket with me not the itemized receipt the check in operator refused to do anything about it and said i would have to take the matter up with american airlines which was the coshare ticketing issuer that was a fatuous suggestion at oclock in the morning with all american airlines offices closed for the night however once on board i explained the situation to a flight attendant who quickly fixed the situation and moved me to a vacant exit aisle seat i then sat back and enjoyed my flight from bangkok to narita with the smiling courteous flight attendants service good quality meals and refreshments and good in flight entertainment i am awarding this flight five stars but if it was up to the totally disinterested ground crew member or american airlines itself i would award a big fat zero,5
i flew from portland oregon to ho chi minh city in may i was on japan airlines for the legs from vancouver ca to narita japan and then on to ho chi minh service on the planes was amazing on the tarmac in narita takeoff was delayed by a thunderstorm the attendants were reassuring and very present in the business cabin reading materials and water was offered to everyone the actual flight was great with wonderful food and comfortable sleeping conditions the problem i had was with gate agents in narita before boarding a gate agent approached me and told me she was checking my bag i only had a small carry on bag my handbag and computer were inside of my carry on i asked her why she was checking my bag she kept asking me if i agreed with her checking it i said i would comply if it was required but i just wanted to know why i looked over at the people lined up in the business class line and they all had between and bags with them yes guy had including a laptop bag portfolio suitcase over the shoulder bag and shopping bag why was i being asked to check another gate agent came over and asked to see my ticket she then told the gate agent who had been trying to check my bag that i was in business class the original agent replied that she had already asked for my bag the other woman walked away so i took my bag laid it on the floor opened it and took out my handbag and medicine she put the checked ticket on the bag and reassured me it would be prioritized to come out first in vietnam she then took the bag away i lined up to get on the plane clutching my med bag and handbag like a character from the beverly hillbillies on the plane business class was less than full i was in a row of seats with only people in the row there were no bags in the bins over my head after i was seated another woman boarded she was in the row behind me and had no bags i asked her about it and she said the gate agents took her bag we were the only women in business class that night i dont know if that was the reason our bags were taken but i did think it when i got to ho chi minh my bag came out last despite the agent telling me it would be priortized to come out first i was thankful that i got my bag and for the wonderful in flight service,4
we travelled on jal in april from london heathrow to tokyo haneda and back i booked tickets via expedia as there were some problems with the jal website in july we called jal to choose seats and special meals which were all confirmed by telephone and documented by myself i tried to call jal several times before we were due to depart but i could not get through on the phone upon check in at heathrow it became apparent that our seats were not those we had been promised and our special meals had not been prepared we were not pleased with this additional stress on a hour flight the staff member at heathrow was very apologetic and wasnt sure why the problem had occurred in the end our seats travellers were still together so this was not a problem but our meals would be standard which we did not want we were given cash to spend in duty free for meal replacements to take on the plane they were very apologetic about the error the lady who helped us made sure that our meals halal for our return flight were booked correctly boarding was straight forward we could board with priority due to having children with us which helped a lot we were sat in rows and a b and c which were reasonably close to the toilets without being too close that we would be disturbed we also seemed to have an extra overhead storage compartment due to the way the seats were in that section of cabin leg room is generous in economy class on jal with their sky wider seats i am so was comfortable with leg room the seats are reasonably comfortable perhaps slightly on the hard side for a hour flight entertainment selection was very good in terms of international films and language options meals were served in good portions in my opinion plus i had the benefit of eating my childrens left overs haha on the way out luckily the regular meals had a fish option that we could eat which was very fortunate as i was not looking forward to cold sandwiches the whole flight we packed plenty of snacks too so we didnt ever feel too hungry i found it very hard to sleep on the flight as i simply couldnt get comfortable with having little legs strewn across my lap and not wanting to move for fear of waking the little one all our fellow passengers were well mannered and there were no disruptions upon arriving at haneda we were greeted by a member of staff with my husbands name on a placard she wanted to apologise for the problems with our meals we thought this was a wonderful touch from jal and it was much appreciated the return flight was pretty much the same as the journey out except this time we had our halal meals as promised we would certainly fly with jal again,4
i went to tokyo japan for a short vacation from april may japan is the best country ive ever been so far their food is fresh and delicious and the people are very disciplined and organized i like the cleanliness of their public toilet but of course jal is the best airline so far when it comes of their amenities and service thank you to okuda ayaka shes very nice and helpful during i dropped off my luggage going back to manila,5
as always jal never ceased to amaze me their crew at the airport is always friendly polite and helpful the onflight staff is even more amazing throughout the flight they offered water tea and juices to keep us travelers hydrated there were snacks and drinks available for your choosing by the flight attendant station which my children loved and i appreciated greatly if you have young children i highly recommend contacting jal prior to your flight to request childrens meals because they were pretty amazing my yo loved all her food as it was presented beautifully there was so much food she gave her food to her yo brother who preferred the childrens meals go figure our meals were not first class but it was delicious nonetheless and there was a lot of food i was actually surprised to see there was a good amount of leg room in the economy cabin we love to fly jal and we will continue to fly jal,5
as per usual had an excellent experience start to finish great checkin left on time plenty of room excellent entertainment and food and superb service cannot recommend enough,5
i visited japan in march flying japan airlines in premium economy class i traveled in a boeing on the way to japan and left that country on bord of a jal i have tried premium economy class of other airlines but the product offered by japan airlines in this class was beyond comparison so good the personal space in both aircrafts was excelent the features of the seats and the seize of the in seat monitor really good food was delicious and many snacks served aditionally to the main meals the attention of the flight attendants reflecting the unique japaneses philosophy of service towards the clients you get even access to the japan airlines business class lounges in japan flying in premium economy class i would fly jal again for sure as the pricequality relation is absolutly worth flying in premium economy,5
traveled with my husband and year old kid from mnl to calgary it was my sons first long haul flight and i was prepared for the worse luckily he slept almost throughout the trip they had give aways for the kids to keep them entertained my son got the utensils case and a jal toy the only downside was that my son was not fond of the food that they served he just ate bread with butter and the ice cream that was served as dessert good thing that i didnt choose a direct flight knowing that my son might get bored in the plane during our lay over that was the time that he ate what i loved about their service was how concerned the flight attendants were when they see that my son wouldnt eat they would always check on him our plane from mnl to jap had a bigger leg room which unfortunately wasnt the same from jap to can going back we were lucky that we were seated right behind the business class area since it had a bigger legroom i also noticed that their lavatories i forgot what route it was were more spacious,4
my husband and i went to japan last year for a week and loved the experience japan is a great place to go and we chose a japanese airline really recommended,4
i flew on boeing for the first time i had requested seat b but c was allocated for me as i bought this ticket as a qantas frequent flyer as it was right behind the kitchen it was quite noisy they didnt provide a glass of drink before taking off and no bottled water was given to us so i asked my small bottle from qantas to be refilled japanese flight attendants were very polite and cordial but i wasnt sure about their safety standard it was very bumpy between beijing and tokyo but the seatbelt sign was not on and flight attendants kept on serving qantas would have stopped im sure when taking off and landing some of the chinese passengers took off their seat belts and moving around but there was no warning announcement,4
first time on jal i was on a late flight past midnight but was hungry since dinner was some time ago but there was not meal service as i think the airline feels that everyone would want to sleep at such a time ok i tried to sleep toodrinks were served on a tray before they turn the lights off come time for breakfast it was dismalthere was no choice you either take the rice breakfast or nothing at alli was looking forward to a good japanese breakfast but the food is just not good as i was famished by that time i ate everything except for the products the cabin crew were very accommodating and service comes with a smile my return trip was much better there was meal choices and food tasted much better i would say it is probably the catering services in singapore that contributed to the bad breakfast in both cases jl and jl the flights were delayed jl was delayed because the incoming flight was late in arriving the return flight jl was delayed initially by an entertainment system issue we waited mins then it got further delayed with some other technical issue another mins wait finally got to board and was then informed that there is some other issuesso we waited on board for another odd minsand was informed that now they need to replace some partsonly took off hours lateri am surprised that most people were quiet and took the delay in quite well we all just watched movies or slept while we waited it out not too great an experience for a first with jal,3
i received a free upgrade to business class it was really nice the seat is comfy i recommend ordering the japanese meals the bed is an angledflat bed but i was still able to sleep the tv programs are limited though for english speakers i recommend bringing an ipad with your own movies,5
the smiles on the faces of the flight attendants cannot hide the contempt they have for their customers id rather just be treated badly than to have someone fake like they care about my comfort during the meal service i was giving the wrong meal i pointed this out to my flight attendant seat k she smiled at me walked away and never came back to correct the situation upon collecting the meal you think she would have inquired as to why i had not touched it nope she took my plate and walked away yes i know im one passenger in a full plane and in economy class no less even still this one employee of jal made my entire flight a miserable situation more than likely i will never fly jal again service your customers with a smile and just an once of compassion,1
in typical japanese fashion the service and interaction with all jal employees was without flaw the flights to and from tokyo departed ontime the flight arriving in nrt was deplaned onto the tarmac which is a rare these days and a bit of a pleasure for those that enjoy aircraft as i do the only complaints that i really have with this trip is the comfort of the seat while the legroom is great the actual seat is a human rights violation in terms of comfort and the crew kept the cabin temperature far too hot if you are a little cold you can put on clothing or use a blanket but if you are too hot there is no escape and it was miserable all of the people in our group had the same gripes one other small complaint was that they served soup for breakfast i actually found it odd but tasty but the other couple didnt care for it and lastly departing from terminal that jal uses at narita is not nearly as nice as terminal which offers much better and more choices for shopping and eating and the observation deck is also much more enjoyable on that side,4
great simple check in no hassles about cabin bags when they xray your bag before checking in security check staff will help with lifting on and off planes clean and comfortable and both boarding and getting off are super fast wonderful polite and helpful staff and even the ground crews bow when you depart and arrive good manner still exist here one of the last places on earth jal leave on time tell you how long to departure and are very clear about boarding procedures all too often a sharp contrast to australian airlines one of my favourite airlines,5
jal leaves nothing to be desired they have covered every inch to enjoy a long flight my husband and i live in the us and visited japan for my husbands first time the trip was very enjoyable and a large part was due to the wonderful treatment from jal they have slipperseye maskstoothbrushesblanketspillowsgamingdelicious foodeye refreshenerhot towelsalcoholhot tea and on and on and on the attendants are top notch and very helpful in every way the plane is so very clean there is a plethora of showsmoviesgames and etc to view while on a long flight the lounges are fantastic as well filled with delicious food drinks and alcohol they were so great with our luggage the restrooms were always clean the staff for jal is so helpful that even when they are not on the plane they assisted us it is completely service oriented any chance i get i will take jal and i will certainly recommend jal to anyone,5
very happy to recommend jal in view of our current flight from sydney to narita the version of we flew on had a seating configuration which seems to give heaps more room than the configuration the food was good if a little too much too regularly staff were friendly helpful and attentive and the new touch screen entertainment system is great although some newer movies would be nice maybe new releases,5
you can expect good swervice on jal and this flight was no exception the aircraft was a new boeing so it was as comfortable as they getthe food service fro and tow sydney is not up to the standard you can expect if you are flying from narita to europe or the us where competition is tougher qantas does not better and perhaps worse and this is something jal might look at overall a good flight,4
flew jal return sydnrt for the first time last week great experience yes website etc is a little outdated but service onboard was amazing i had over and return both had the roomiest economy seat i have ever sat in so relaxing cabins very clean and bathrooms cleaned regularly by crew food was good and service was very attentive it seemed like the crew genuinely wanted to be there always smiling etc neither flight was full and crew were attentively moving passengers once boarded to ensure everyone had a spare seat next to them that wanted very thoughtful,5
this is our third time we have travelled japan airlines because their service is consistently excellent the cabin crew offer every comfort consistently looking to make your trip a great experience and the selection of food is wonderful i think the highlight of travelling with japanese airlines is their staff they are they epitome of wonderful japanese hospitality and service,5
could not have asked for more us airlines need to learn from their foreign competition on how to treat their passengers jals excellent service started before we even boarded the flight premium economy passengers have access to one of their lounges nice touch on board the service was nonstop and attentive the seats were comfortable and the selection of amenities extensive food was excellent with numerous choices well prepared and nicely presented a delightful treat was their udon in the sky the best tasting cup of udon on the market just prior to landing each of the flight attendants assigned to our area came by and personally thanked each of us for flying jal a real thank you,5
i had a remarkable experience with the airline both ground and cabin crew are hospitable transit in narita was smooth would highly recommend jal for a smooth travel experience,5
the seats are ancient degree uncomfortable worn out to the point you can feel where the previous passengers cheeks wore out the seat and impossible in which to sleep jal is woefully behind in its business class seating on this route and should not be able to charge business class prices for this seat it should be premium economy,1
my first flight with jal was a very nice experience plenty of room even in the economy class excellent service and very attentive personnel,5
i usually fly ba first but i thought i would give jal first class a try because the japanese normally do things particularly well the jal cabin is a pleasant enough place to be although im not overly keen on their frequent use of brown for the decor its not an offensive colour but it does make the cabin look a tad dated i didnt find the seat anything like as comfortable as bas equivalent which i find to be one of the best its not awful but i found towards the end of the flight it felt a little firm im also not a fan of the vinyl material they use for the seat covering dont get me wrong i wouldnt have liked to see leather seats but i think a fabric covered seat is better for a long flight thes a lot of space around the seat and loads of cubby holes to keep your stuff in they also give you very nice amenities which are much better than on other airlines additionally you can relax in a the porsche design pjs they give you sleep comfort was good and the cabin temperature was ok but perhaps verging on the side of being too warm a choice of mattress topper is offered firm or soft which is a nice touch although i found the pillows to be much too soft food was average wine excellent im vegan so im used to being disappointed by airline food and this was no different i dont know why the fancy chefs these airlines hire for their premium cabins cant come up with some more creative vegan offerings best part was the service which was simply outstanding the crew were very friendly always immediately on hand to helpthey really couldnt do enough and anticipated my every whim i think it was probably the best service ive experienced in the air rivalling even cx who i rate pretty highly overall a very pleasant flight if the seat was a little better it would be up there with the very best,4
it was my first time flying with japan airlines the service is really very attentive and the plane is really very clean us carriers have a lot to learn,5
super flight and lovely staff food was fantastic entertainment was better than i expected it to be a really great start to our holiday in japan i would absolutely book again and recommend this airline our flight home was with ba which was poor in comparison,5
we booked jal flight to japan and we flew in to osaka and depart from narita airport the flight was in the wee hours and transit at haneda airport the legroom is spacious and comfortable service crew are friendly and the food is superb from singapore to japan it served miso soup which was surprisingly good the not so good was there were no announcement when we boarded the plane and just switched off the lights assuming passengers will be sleeping due to the timing am flight the inflight entertainment was not working for few hours and only got it rectified when we were waken up for breakfast improvement needed in the communication so that passengers are aware of whats going on overall not bad experience and will list them in my preferred airlines record,4
i have maybe flights with different airlines but never i got such a fantastic service the crew is so polite and so friendly they always check if everything is ok and dont just lazy around food was excellent i dont remember having icecream with any other company baggage delivery was quick boarding excellent,5
my wife i flew from honolulu hi to nagoya japan this was our first time flying with jal we found the service excellentthe ticketing agents were very professional and went out of their way to help travelers the stewardess on board our flight were very friendly all of them had a smile on their facesthe food service was excellentwe flew economy but the leg space on our plane was great lots of amenities on board personal slippers for your comfort free movies with free head sets free snacks drinks including wine or sake for dinner love it,5
we flew round trip from sfo to hnd then to tsa to visit tokyo and taipei weve been to these cities many times this is the first time we flew with jal and we certainly were not disappointed as with many of the asian airlines you will feel that you are really welcomed by all of the airline staff unlink the united airlines which makes you feel that they are doing you a big favor the seats in the economy section are very comfortable and have plenty of legroom a large tv screen in the seat back offers many entertainment choices including recent hollywood movies etc the food was delicious too although i feel they couldve put less rice and more food in the main dish but i understand that rice is the main dish for japanese so thats how it goes the restrooms are kept very clean throughout the flight they also provide disposable tooth brush for you convenience i think on jal flights most of the passengers are japanese and they tend to be more polite and quieter so you will enjoy the flights even better i will definitely fly jal again,5
excellent service i bought roundtrip tix cgknaritacgk is totally worth it but music collection from ife not good enough meal from narita to cgk is one of the best but not from cgk narita is little bit tasteless seafood fried rice,5
we had one passenger traveling with us that required a wheelchair at every layover a jal representative was at the gate ready to transfer my mom between the gates or terminals everyone was courteous and helpful one customer representative even pushed my mom from haneda international to the domestic terminal wow i was expecting him to say this is where you catch the bus to the other terminal he brought us to the domestic jal smile service center who then took over dont expect the rude treatment of delta airlines toward passengers on this carrier not expecting they would drag people of the plane here ever quite the opposite we also had a child with us and had requested a kids meal for the flight this was honored without even having to ask the attendants as we boarded the attendants had my sons information and had confirmed the request he was served his meal before the general distribution really helpful when traveling with a young child the adult meals served were good had a selection of two meat options bonus was the haggen dazs ice cream served after one of meals passengers are able to go to the mid or rear of plane to get snacks if the choose assortment of chocolate cookies and crackers available entertainment available on the flight was great a great mix of current and relatively recent movies also had option to customize audio monitor flight plan maps play games and purchase merchandise restroom facilities were clean assuming the attendants perform a sweep through every so often as the toilet rolls were always full and folded in a point also didnt smell bad from over usage with a hour flight the planes arrived and left on time throughout our various legs to final destination now im spoilt and will be expecting this level of service from us carriers,5
cant imagine jal can have a very good leg room on the plane and with very good and advanced technology entertainment system thats is really impress me that jal provide a nice plane for passengers service is really good and fast food is good also overall is stars in stead of stars,4
jal provides a good customer experience flying directly to haneda from sfo be sure to check into your flight at the first available time otherwise you might not get seats where you want thankfully when checking our baggage in the clerk was able to get my wife and i two seats together staff was attentive and friendly food was good in flight entertainment had lots of movies available in english,5
pros leg room is good enough flight attendant are corteous inflight movie is updated the st class and business class looks good cons we travel during th spring time and i understand that the weather outside is rather cold so they use the heater but heater for the whole hrs travel was uncomfortable i had to fan myself and it was hard to sleep when its too warm probably use heater on the first few minutes but do cool down the temperature after i had a migraine after my ride,3
disappointed that japan airlines has not responded after weeks of management is researching the simple facts my original post can be seen one wek ago here on atravel advisor hmm they would not sell me an available seat in business clas after requesting this at the time of reservation then check in then at the gate and on the plane when i found an available business class seat i have given them till noon cebu city time on may st to respond notification was to customer service by phone last week and here onfb linkedin and travel advisor that if i dont get a response in this reasonable amount of time i will be taking further legal action why dont they just take care of this so i can close this chapter and move forward hmm,2
very desapointed with my first flight on jal i have booked a flight from nagoya to helsinki for my family on jalpeoples i was not able to registered online i arrived at the airport more than two hours between take off at the moment to registered the steward told us that it is not possible to have seat nearb but it will tried to solve this he said the flight is full he couldnt and he propose an other solution where seat are not a nearby at all we noticed that the seats are at the middle of the plane instead in the first rank when we arrived in the plane we observed that there first places which were planed where much more comfortable that the places we have more space and when you are tall as im its important if the steward told us that we will have choose the more solutions the same we have on the flight from helsinki to nagoya overbooking so we are very desapointed with the first experience with jal and no email to contact,1
cant say enough good about the entire experience on jal nozomi bullet train drops you off a terminal for easy access to jal checkin was efficient easy and staff were very polite the sakura cherry blossom lounge for premium economy was delightful with full salad bar and delicious main courses plus desserts and free wines and a full array of adult beverages airplane seats were spacious and offered many sleeping comforts food on board was excellent they provided headphones that actually allowed you to hear the inflight entertainment but most terrific part of this flight was the amazing courteousness of the flight crew couldnt have acted more pleasantly or been more friendly or more helpful,5
top service standard crew was very friendly and professional and very helpful seats were spacious and comfortable with good legroom food was lovely and delicious and very well laid out and plated checkin was very warm and friendly and boarding was done japanese style with great precision using announcements to board in groups by seat rows punctuality was tops my favourite airline,5
as typical of japanese service checkin and boarding was efficient and courteous the skywider seats in economy were the best of any airline i have ever experienced with more leg room than needed and a wider seat also loved the folding headrests to nestle my head with neckstyled pillow although i used the pillow and blanket as lumbar and bottom rests as the seats can be deemed a bit thin on cushioning after plus hours the inflight entertainment was on one largest screens i have ever experienced including premium economy on other airlines with a nice selection of movies from hollywood and beyond meal service was pleasant with a snack of rice crackers and drink of your choice of beverage sodas juices beer and liquor dinner was served about hours into the flight with choice of fish or chicken minimally westernized japanese entrees it came with sides of a soba salad seaweed salad and a fruit mix all very high quality and crafted with care unlike those of american based airlines this was on par with meals of ba and af from europe choice of beverage including wine was served with dinner as usual with transpacific asian airlines haagen daz was provided shortly after dinner after lights out was self serve snacks and drinks by the galley this included juiceswater various crackers cookies chocolates and candies toothbrushes are available in the restrooms midway through the flight for those wanting to freshen up before breakfast the last meal consisted of a warm pasta salad yogurt and fruit overall the flight was very well serviced including flight attendants walking throughout the duration of the flight checking on any customer needs what happened next was extraordinary and confirmed what i believe to be outstanding of japanese serviceculture while deplaning in hnd we had left a small cloth satchel containing cosmetics chocolate and a toothbrush we did not realize this until we were settled in our hotel a few hours later we naturally assumed it would be disposed of along with all the other things that people leave on board airplanes so they could get it turned around for the next flight fast forward days during our checkin from hnd sfo after we were handed our boarding passes we asked by chance if they found our satchel on the plane from a flight a week ago after a brief description and confirmation of our previous flight information the agent said someone would be out with it in minutes wow and in minutes while waiting i walked by the money changer and notice a jal employee burst our a door running by with the satchel we misplaced earlier much to my wifes delight she go her bag back this is very japanese where honor and customer service are of the upmost importance executed with respect efficiency and grace domo arigatou gozaimasu,5
from my facebook post poor customer service alert on japan airlines jal i tried to buy this seat times during reservation at check in and on the plane and was told it was not available on the plane it clearly is available and with my back injury demonstrated to the flight crew with photographs and my obviously swollen feet was told so sorry by chief cabin attendant kyoko ono after my offer to purchase this on the plane not sure is this is stupidity racism japans history or insensitivity to handicapped people i have requested a call from their management twice now and have got nothing back so far if not today this gets posted in my linkedin profile with ove contacts that travel extensivelygood service from jal over the years are erased by this blunder his flight commemorated my th miles actually flown for business on their partner american airlines this is a good chunk of my actual flown miles with various carriers over my year career span still awaiting a call from jal or american airlines its now been over weeks and im still waiting to hear back from jal management yesterday i sent a message to management through their customer service contacts very weak trained that said i must wait without any commitment on a due date for their response this is to be considered my official notice that the due date is may st aka mayday universalr term for distress by noon cebu city philippines time or before for appropriate apologies and financial consideration if someone has contact info on the firm handling the united airlines fiasco please share this in case i need to take action i sincerely do not want to take my preference is to update and remove my facebook post yet they drag their feet and show further disrespect towards white people and handicapped americansthis will now go on linkedin with the same sincere request for professional resolution all the best dave kilian,2
the service standard was high in japan similarly compared to the airlines in many other countries japan airlines is a lot better the seats were comfortable the leg space was the most generous among all the airlines i have flown the service was amazing the flight attendants were very friendly and always smiling they remember the simple requests the meal was much better than most of other airlines in terms of both the portion and the taste there was also japanese beer sake and plum wine to choose from on top of regular drinks i strongly recommend jal,5
quite possibly as good as it gets in economy class all of the flight attendants were polite and provided great service the seat itself was great for economy class because jal only has seats across on the each seat was a nice inches wide with inches of pitch compare that to the inch wide seats on the same plane on american airlines with only inches of pitch the food was also very tasty and dessert was haagen dazs ice cream in terms of inflight entertainment each economy seat had a pretty big screen on the back of the seat containing a good selection of movies and tv shows in both japanese and english there probably could have been more hollywood blockbusters included by thats just nitpicking on details overall it was a great flight,5
we flew from dub to tokyo via helsinki and on the way back flew from osaka itami to dublin via hnd i thought that the transfers would be complicated in helsinki and tokyo but they were seamless the worst was heathrow so poor in regards to the service and their standards i cannot fault japan airlines they made our honeymoon special and made us feel like family they know how to be a full service airline and they are proud of their job fantastic all around and i can verify that they are one of the best in the world thank you jal,5
just experienced jal after a lapse of many years had to go to osaka to via haneda the transit experiences were efficient but lacked the expectations transit information english was incorrect suspect the company never reviewed the english version i thought the planes were old the entertainment panel and the programmes were behind the the newer competitors fundamentally old another old positive is the japanese service which was good but the linguistic skill of the announcers were similarly like before english pronunciation remains old japanese standard but this is throughout japan standard of spoken english remains archaic one great positive was the breakfast hours before landing at changi it was superb the plane landed at am minutes behind the schedule the pilot apologised what great courtesy thats japanese these make me going back there imagine when the japan tourist board wakes up,4
i fly jal every months they are my first choice wish they did hnl to bkk highly recommended they go out of there waywith classic japanese stylegreat serviceand amazing fooddrinks very comfortable,5
i flew with a of people to japan and without a doubt the flight to tokyo and the return flight was one of the best air travel experiences of our lives for me personally i can confidently state that this was the best flying experience in coach class i have ever had and i have flown a lot including many international trips the seats are compared to for domestic flights wide and have an extra of legroom due to increase pitch and a slimmer seat design one of the things which stands out is that when we were about to land in tokyo the flight attendants took the time to walk through the entire aircraft look each and every passenger in the eye and personally thank us individually for flying with them,5
excellent food comfy seats free wine excellent inflight entertainment with lots of choices of new movies easy checkin and efficient and friendly flight staff,5
best airline experience ive ever had the seats are very comfortable if you arent able to upgrade to business class with mileage we werent i highly suggest premium economy we found out about it for our return flight and the seats were roomier and the foot position was movable up and down very important on a hour flight the food is also terrific by far the best coach food ive ever had an extremely pleasant staff,5
superb customer service polite gracious and friendly fas excellent meals a choice of japanese and western food i opted for japanese cuisine which was sublime the passengers were predominately japanese who exhibited utmost respect for fellow passangers by not reclining the seat and the toilets remained clean from takeoff to landing the flight with jal set the tone for my holiday as it was a wonderful relaxing experience i highly recommend this airline to everyone,5
flown with jal many times japan hospitality is the best compared to australian airlines on top of great service you can check in twice as much as most airlines at narita airport i had a connecting flight to osaka however the staff realised for me that i actually needed to be at haneda airport quite a shock for me but the check in lady took me to the correct bus counter in the airport to get to haneda she even knew when the bus was leaving good luck getting that service from australian airlines small tip if you plan to buy a data sim card in japan for your photo you can do buy it from the flight attendants during your flight check the onflight shopping section on the entertainment system its cheaper than buying at the airport flying domestic from tokyo to osaka is also a pleasure i was really worried i might miss my flight as i had to bus it between the two tokyo airports but in japan you can check in with less than minutes from flight departure again good luck checking in on an aussie airline with less than minutes before the flight if you are flying to japan jal should be your top choice,5
flew jal home from thailand it was a wonderful flight including having to be bused from narita to haneda staff were exceedingly nice and made the flight ever so enjoyable,5
best flying experience ive had we flew economy and the seats were very comfortable and we did have good leg space the crew was so nice and attentive to our comfort the food was super good,5
on mar th i took flt out of ohare on apr th i took flt back from narita airport impressive the economy seats cloth comfortable nice tv with new cleaned headphones the selections were very good for everything except music choices bathrooms seemed very clean as well as the entire plane above average food with nice hot wash clothes offered a couple times ea flight blankets and pillows for everyone even in economy very friendly always smiling flight attendants very patient and diligent workers at counters and baggage areas i am a first time flyer on a foreign airline it beat every domestic airline i have been on in the us i see they made the top ten airlines in the world on tripadvisor after my flight i did not see ana like i read other reviews for i did like row in front of the bathrooms behind us was a crew storage i believe i could put my seat back without feeling offensive no extra noise or smell it fact most foreign travelers did not get up but usually once on the hour flight i got up or times im not a well sitting person smooth flight and landings were without any bump on the runway that impressed me i liked the crew before boarding looking at the travelers and bowing and smiling at them then turning to man the aircraft i felt comfortable as i am usually stressed before any flight anywhere i would recommend this airline to a friend and take it again myself,5
this was the second leg of a flight from lax to singapore a code share united flight i boarded in narita and thought i might want to sleep part of this leg as i was exhausted but id see how the flight went i generally wouldnt have but the first leg of the flight from lax to nrt was brutal in business class but the seats in front of me had passengers who insisted on talking to each other across the aisle the person behind me insisted on using my backrest as a leaning device every time he got up and there was a screaming child three rows over i couldnt sleep but a half hour all the way across the pacific i wasnt sure i wanted a middle seat on this flight but i was assured i was the only one in the middle seat when i boarded the plane and saw that seat oh my little tables on both sides of me the lay flat seat in the middle fully featured set up in front of me power outlet pull out drawers and ledges screen etc i settled in and i think i was asleep before we were even minutes into the flight i missed meal service but didnt really miss it i think i woke up once and headed to the lavatory and when i got back to my seat the flight angels had fluffed my pillow reset my duvet rearranged my slippers and vanished i never heard a single sound the entire flight but the light whisper of the flight attendants skirts and they whisked past down the aisle the other passengers the most polite passengers ive ever seen on any flight anywhere and remember this was just coming off of a flight with some of the loudest and rudest passengers so oh my gosh heaven a full seven hours of utter silence i didnt even really know there was anyone there unless i pulled a gopher and popped my head up over my little seating area absolutely the best service anywhere bottles of water were replaced before they were empty and i had two bottles put into my hands before i left the plane most polite flight attendants anywhere and the bit of food i ate was truly lovely i felt like i was in first class i think the only thing missing was a shower and bathrobe,5
seats are nice with noticeably more room than any american airline service was excellent entertainment was first class i will fly with them every chance that i get,5
superb customer service fas are friendly in flight meal is okay with in flight entertainment and can charge phone but why is the doraemon movie has no english subtitle overall had a good flight experience,4
food is great they serve some traditional japanese food and western food the flight is on time and smooth,5
this flight was full and left on time and arrived on time the aircraft was a new boering with the benefits that aircraft supplies food service was good and better than mostthe staff were as usual friendly and courteous they do need to do a better job in providing customers with arrival documents as none were supplied baggage collection in narita is always fast,4
its my second time to fly japan airlines on business class the flight is very nice and very smooth we had a comfortable and fussfree flight on both ways what i like the flatbed seats in business class is superb plus the pillow is very comfortable nice and smooth plane ride flight attendants are very nice and accommodating entertainment selections are good movies are current the sakura business lounge in narita is superb they have a relaxation room where you can get free massages food selection needs improvement though what i dont like the headsets are stored in a tacky plastic bag the menu can be improved they are good but i had better business class food selections in the past inflight wifi was wonky on our flight back,4
i have flown with jal twice to go to japan the cost is comparable to other direct flights the in flight service is amazing i have flown many north american airlines and there is no airline that even comes close to jal my next trip to japan will definitely be with japan airlines without a doubt,5
the service of jal is star it had the best food including japanese noodles yummy fruits etc the lavatories are clean crew are very professional if you are a oneword frequent flyer it is star,5
i was really surprised to find that the economy class seat of jal is spacious with enough leg room the vegetarian meal was also a surprise and the haagendazs ice cream was just wow the cabin was quiet and i really appreciate the plug where i could charge my phone to get me ready upon landing,5
took jal business class round trip from vancouver to hong kong and have to say the service was amazing jal has us based airlines beat on service it is a shame that they dont fly from the us to europe,5
i flew from copenhagen to tokyo for a meeting with jal however from copenhagen to paris was flown by air france under code share the flight from paris to tokyo was the best for me have been flying since the warm towel provided on board is fantastic that is only provided in business class on other airlines food and drinks quality is great i would recommend it,5
not the best in business class travel but very comfortable and efficient offered a turn down service as well speedy check in fast track immigration and priority boarding everything youd expect in sydney on the way back we had a stopover in tokyo and i guess jal would have a lot of business class passengers and didnt offer the fast track service plane was a bit worn and not the new planes theyve been operating eith previously was expecting the japanese food offering to be better and although the presentation was good overall quite bland and was slightly disappointed on the quality steak on the way back was wonderful though not enough in my opinion wife didnt even want to share her steak as i had the japanese option,5
the services of jal is very good they give cuatomers a good care they are very professional when in task their food looks small but delicous and high quality,5
caution i purchased tickets for me and girlfriend to fly from new york to tokyo on one of their dreamliners we were extremely excited about flying on a dreamliner it was a big reason why we chose to fly on jal we elected to stick with economy seating because the configuration allowed us to have a section to ourselves with no middle seat before our trip however the airline made two unilateral changes delayed the flight to tokyo by hours which impacted our plans upon arrival they called to tell us this yet made no mention of a plane change or moving our seats and with zero notice the airplane swapped out the advertised dreamliner to an older model with economy seating additionally they separated the two of us on the hour flight and we no longer are seated next to each other the flight is fully booked so we were stuck overall we are extremely disappointed and frustrated with jal and would advise caution when booking with them jal advertised a certain plane and seating chart plus specific flight times then after they received our money switched us to a worse plane moved our seats apart and shortened our vacation as others have noted jals customer service is awful they dont even pretend to care and make no effort to address travel issues they have created we made phone calls and emailed customer service the only option they offered us was to cancel our flight just weeks before we were scheduled to depart when other airlines are booked or super expensive anyways if you are going to purchase tickets on jal be prepared for disappointment,2
i flew this flight on march th the first meal was fine and then after hours or so they passed out a bunch of mush wow how disappointing when hungry it looked good but there was not much to it but my main beef is that upon arriva after nearly hours we were dumped onto a remote tarma in the rain to walk to buses for ja ostling ride to the terminal it was worse than a lufthansa intraeuro shuttle beyond that there were plenty of available spots with jetways it was a cost saving stupid decision,2
japan airlines is always good and the staff are friendly and courteous the aircraft was clean and the flight left and arrived essentially on time baggage arrived promptly as it always does in naritathe food service is definitelynot to the standard you get on other more competitive japan airlines flights such as those to london and lax where there is much more competition the food out of japan is usually better than into japan where jal rely on other suppliers overall good but business class food service could be better,3
i flew to tokyo from new york stopping in lax briefly this was a code share with american airlines the return trip was with japan airlines the trip going to tokyo was comfortable and what i really liked about it was that since i do not sleep at all on planes i read the entire time the aa plane going from lax to tokyo had an actual plug so i could plug my kindle in not a usb port but they had that as well so i was able to read up until the time we landed the return trip jal had the usb port but i had about hours left and my kindle ran out otherwise the food was good and the staff extremely accommodating i would fly jal again but it is difficult to reach them on the telephone and their website is not the easiest to navigate,4
very clean airline humble staff got an upgrade to premium economy food was really good way better than any international airline i have tasted also soft drinks and water and tea was offered all over the flight tooth brush offered too hostess were very very friendly,5
jal does a good job on this very competitive leg between narita and lax the aircraft is a standard but the food quality was a signiricant improvement over some other jal international flights when there is not as much competition service is always friendly and good the flight departed on time and arrived on time so overall a very good experience,4
i flew business class japan airlines from san diego if first impressions count the lounge they share is beyond sad and bare i should have known then we were in for a bumpy ride the seat is very small in comparison to most other major airlines their seats do not go into a flat bed and the front of the seat is lower that rest of seat so you keep feeing like you slipping down hours of this was agony on my back i just could not get comfortable the food fell below standard too if you want to order from their anytime menu you have to wait an hour after meal service which i passed on hanea airport is faaaar out from anywhere in tokyo and took us hours in a car to sinjuku i am not looking forward to flight back home being cramped on a limp seat for hours is no fun,2
jal changed the aircraft of their tokyokl route to boeing dreamliner instead of boeing in september we used our enrich miles to redeem a single trip back from narita to kl the aircraft was fitted with jal skysuite which is spacious and have a lot of privacy however as a travelling couples we were unable to sit side by side as per conventional seats as the seating arrangement is in staggering form jals bedd business class meal is always our favourite and its wasnt disappointed jal is also one of the very few airlines providing pyjamas for a hour dayflight it was a nice touch however compared to few months ago they didnt provide the face masks and eye masks for the passengers this round the monitor is of hd quality and the earphone is great the level of service is as usual top norch and the flight was smooth and pleasant its certainly much better than the malaysia airlines new a business class,5
i am writing to you to express my ultimate appreciation for the service and absolute professionalism to the entire staff at jal narita airport coming from boston on a non stop flight to tokyo i was initially worried about the flight experience not having been on a flight nearly that long hours i was amazed at the food comfort and best of all service through out the flight my economy class seat felt like first class now to the staff at narita on my return trip to boston because of delays and traffic conditions we were arriving extremely late to the airport we called ahead and informed jal of our situation and they told us they would do everything possible to get us on the plane when arriving i was sure there was no possible way i would make the flight arriving at the desk with two large bags to check in the staff quickly sprang into action checking the bags and expediting my way through security to the plane where i made my flight i salute the employees at narita airport and throughout the company for being the pinnacle of airline service and professionalism jal will be my first choice wherever i go thank you,5
the economy class in this airline is top notch good old fashion service the flight attendants were very attentive i left my back pack in one of the terminals but i wasnt sure which one i only learned of this when i was boarding the airplane i told the ladies at the gate they made some calls and within minutes my back pack was found the employees at jal told me the flight had to depart however they would get the name of my hotel and make sure it arrives at my hotel on the next flight sure enough it did great service great food excellent leg room,5
again poor connection within japan disappoints with jal the domestic flight from cts arrives in haneda one has to take luggage from this to a bus transfer for hour to narita then check in again at narita im sure its not beyond the realms of possibility to provide a smoother service for premium paying customers in addition at check in at cts the jal staff directed us to the economy check in despite explaining we were travelling in j class domestically and x internationally this caused a misunderstanding later overcome about usage of the business class lounge at cts and no application of priority labels for luggage that we had to pick up and transfer to the bus for narita the answer is one should check in at jal global counter as there is no business class counter at cts for domestic flights staff should have known this in flight service on both sectors was excellent,4
jal provides an excellent service only let down by the inability to through book luggage from international to domestic despite connection at the same airport haneda luggage has to be taken off at haneda cleared through customs then taken by hand to be dropped for the domestic flight,4
the seat is quiet wider for economy class and also the pitch between seat relatively more room the quality of food is good but the taste relatively plain for indonesian passenger overall is ok cabin attendants professional helpful and keep japanese culture traditionally polite the fleet itself quiet new and maintained well inflight entertaiment actually good but we cant tilt the display to adjust viewing,4
it has been years since my last flight with the japan airlines service is still top among other competitors comfort of seats in the economy cabin seemed to have been improved limited choices of meals but of above average quality,4
excellent service more leg room than in the past and decent food and drinks seat did get a big uncomfortable towards the end of the flight,4
i traveled on flights jl jl jl jl flight attendants were amazingprofessional charismatic and friendly made my traveling experience amazing the quality of service you get from jl is unmatched w any airlines i have ever flown on in my life one word awesomeness,5
the service and professionalism on jal is unsurpassed i flew from chicago to tokyo and was lucky enough to be on board the star wars themed bb airliner and it was phenomenal the first class seatcubby was wonderful seat folded flat into a comfy bed with an additional pad available and a fluffy comforter the flight attendants were impeccably dressed neat and extremely polite they were very attentive without being intrusive whenserving they even wore aprons with the bb robot on themit was so cool the food and snacks were varied very plentiful and delicious breakfast choices included either a traditional japanese breakfast or a traditional american breakfast will fly them again,5
was on a family trip with my wife and young kids short checkin queue in singapore and got seats in the middle in the bassinet row so lots of space there was wifi on board but we didnt try it the inflight entertainment equipment touch screen could use my kids headphones instead was good but did not have enough international options nonetheless it kept me occupied as i could not sleep there was only regular dinner option that was bad as was my wifes gluten free meal we landed on time got our luggage soon all was ok except the food and the inflight entertainment options,3
no long haul return home flight is ever primo to this i will say i did not feel good the entire trip home however i will say the seats were comfortable the leg room for me was great entertainment was great food was very japan which is to be expected just not my taste at allthe planes were very comfy but the take off and landings were very fast to the point my ears hurt i would def fly again for the service and comfort,5
the staff at boarding noticed that we had booked our family in different parts of the airplane and proposed to move us together with the added bonus of having more leg room for me at the front the breakfast was really good except maybe the croissant and we all managed to sleep during the redeye flight boarding was a breeze from start to finish transfer at haneda could be explained proactively you have to take a free bus from domestic to international airport,4
i have flown a lot of different airlines around the world and jal is now my favorite from the amazing staff to the fabulous food couldnt ask for a better experience,5
my son and i flew from hanoi to tokyo in june our seats were initially unassigned as we ticketed through american airlines but at check in we were upgrated to premium economy i have flown first class several times on domestic airlines in the united states but this was the most pleasant flight i have ever had the flight attendants were incredibly gracious warm and calm the seats were incredibly comfortable the food and drinks were outstanding and the in flight music and movie selection was first rate i will look for every possible opportunity to fly jals premium economy class in the future,5
very pleasant flight on a nice new bw food was fantastic the cabin is nice and clean me and my friend were sitting at the very back of the fight and without a question it was very comfortable,5
japan airlines has the best service available in flying courteous and caring flight attendants make you feel comfortable the whole time i wish to fly jal everytime i fly to asia,5
a wonderful and enjoyable flight home after our honeymoon in tokyo the flight was comfortable service was excellent and lunch was tasty i actually watched movies during my flight and took a short nap in between it was amazing experience to fly with jal,5
we flew from kul to nrt for a overnight flight and it was a very pleasant and enjoyable flight its our first time taking jal and we were so surprised to be upgraded from economy to premium economy we enjoyed the comfortable seats tasty breakfast and good inflight entertainment also worth mentioning their service is impeccable such a great start for our honeymoon,5
i was fortunate to fly on points in business class on dream liner seating was incredibly comfortable and food and service were excellent staff are very friendly and courteous,5
the two flights it took from chicago to hcmc vietnam was through tokyo service on both flights was very cordial and thorough the inflight movies documentaries music and flight information was extensive and spoton entertaining ground staff i encountered were also quick to respond to my requests,5
when flying between the us and japan id highly recommend japan air lines clean spacious and comfortable food is good with plenty of entertainment to make the long flight go by very fast check in attendants at narita were extremely helpful i was traveling with ski equipment sitting in economy i was only allowed checked bags skis my suitcase when i showed them my small ski boot bag they checked it free of charge wonderful customer service and i would definitely fly them again,5
flight was great business class seat private and very comfortable i do like japanese food but not for all meals was unhappy that there were not more choices being offered have been to asia on other airlines and the food choices were much better for westerners flight attendants could not have been more attentive due to food probably will not fly them again,4
this review pertains to both outward sydnrt and return nrtsyd flights jal first class was truly delightful this was our first international flight in first as opposed to business class and the difference was very noticeable both in terms of service and seat quality the privacy afforded by the seats on the er we were fortunate enough to occupy was lovely most of the time one could relax and imagine there was noone else nearby until that is one wanted a drink refill or something to eat when the staff would immediately appear i was mildly annoyed by the fact that our party of including young children were not seated together on the return flight instead seated at the four corners of the seat cabin i was concerned that our children would not be able to remain quiet without a parent seated next to them something the airline had been helpful in arranging on the initial flight and that i would need to apologise to other passengers for noise or crying fortunately as the flight was a night one they slept nearly the whole flight a testament to the comfort of the beds but i was rather surprised that the airline would not have grouped us together given that our booking was made moths in advance and the ages of the children clearly noted,5
wow our american flights were changed around because of weather and we were placed on japan airlines on our way home from the philippines i cannot even begin to tell you how much better this airline was to fly first off their coach seats are as roomy as extended leg room upgrades on americanmaybe bigger and you dont have to pay more that alone makes me respect them because they treat people like human beings instead of sardines the video screens were on then back of the seats and they were a nice size more like an ipad rather than a large phone like on american plus there are little stretchy pockets on the back of the seat where you can put your glasses or a water bottle or whatever you want to easily keep within reach super convenient and smartly planned the food was amazing i was stunned actually they kept us well fed throughout the flight and the flight attendants are incredibly sweet and attentive i actually enjoyed our super long flight we are going to indonesia in october and planned our trip in such a manner that we will be flying with japan airlines the whole way even though we are american airlines mileage members we got lucky that we could use japan airlines for the whole trip im actually excited to fly because of this great airline american and united could take some lessons from this airline company on every level sorry i cant remember what kind of plane it was,5
i actually booked this flight as an american airlines codeshare and didnt know it until american wouldnt assign me any seats months before the flight the seats in economy were the roomiest compared to all us airlines im and i had in front of my knees in regular economy i didnt get this much room paying extra on aa and i never did on united because the upgrade to economy plus price is ridiculous each seat in economy had its own power port and usb port to keep you electronic device going there was a larger than average screen to watch movies that you could start or resume at any time the food was good and beer and wine were free jal has made the hour economy flight bearable ill shop with jal right from the start next time and forego any of my aa miles because they only gave me half on a codeshare anyway,5
as with every flight i have taken with jal this was a very comfortable relaxing and enjoyable flight they were very efficient at boarding and getting the flight away on time the seat was very comfortable and spacious for a regional business class staff were very friendly and helpful and were willing to offer advice and recommendation on our destination the food and drink was of a high quality and of a good quantity for flight of a reasonably short distance it was definitely good value for money every time i have flown business with jal domestically regionally and between europe and japan i have found them to be of a very high level and would always recommend flying with jal,5
as this would be a very long flight from chicago i researched both jal and ana thoroughly i talked with coworkers and family i flew to japan for business and leisure travel in octobernovember i chose jal since they were offering a promotion with the premium economy seats jals staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful at all times seating was comfortable and excellent choice food was excellent and i was introduced to a new snack natto i saved a bag so i could purchase this product in the usa yet it wasnt available here yet so i will consider ordering this thru ebay or amazon since it is only offered overseas jals airplane was clean comfortable and thoroughly enjoyable jal also included slippers at no extra chargei would rate them outstanding,5
excellent legroom very good service and movie selection not too sure about its boast of being the most punctual but i might prefer it to other options for a flight to japan in future,5
this is my first time travelling to other country and the very first country that i travel is japan for your information im malaysian and it is just like wow impression that very first travel is go to japan there a lot of country in asean that have so much attractio but japan is my choice to start my travel agenda so in order for going to japan japan airline is one from flight that i take main thing that i reaally love of japan airline is they can serve a really great muslem meal for muslim passenger,5
food is great and never stop coming started with light refreshment and the main meal was great and later serve ice cream for desert within hours they serve around of cake and refreshment,4
pleasant enough flightand the flight attendants are outstanding there is a discernable different between how these flight attendants treat passengers in coach versus what most other and especially us based airlines flight attendants do lots of smiles very polite very respectful a breath of fresh air however there are some distinct drawbacks to jal in certain lower cost fare classes you cannot secure a seat assignment until generally hours before departure this is annoying then to secure the seat assignment online you need to know the jal booking reference code therefore if you book a jal segment through a travel agent or through another partner airlines call that provider and get the jal booking code and it will be different from the partner airlines code the legroom is significantly less im guessing inches less than say aas economy extra for short hauls okay for long hauls it would be torture no frequent flyer miles for example for most economy fares in the aa frequent flyer program even though jal is a partner airline finally announcements are nonending and say the same thing time and time again very hard to watch a movie in jal with all there interruptions having said that their selection of entertainment options is quite good,2
our short flight was delayed by about hours mainly due to tpes inept traffic controller that couldnt handle the traffic like towers from other parts of civilized world the seats were similar to us domestic business classes with probably a little more leg room and more reclining i actually slept for about an hour during the flight so that was good the executive lounge at hnd was far from our gate but with the long delay we had no problem getting to and back to the gate but unfortunately there was no first class lounge so the choices of food and drinks were quite basic as noted above nothing special about the flight or the lounge though the service was decent,3
my wife and i decided to try jal instead of our regular airlines aa for the flight to taiwan with a change of plane in haneda we had really good memories of the last few times that we flew jal on pacific crossing flights this time around it wasnt as good the service was good but the food has fallen a little from our previous flights though they still serve hot udon soup which i enjoyed the seats however were not layflat it was my fault for not checking the plane before booking as i expected all pacific crossing flights on the other hand the angleflat seats were still better than aas angle flat seats on those flights from lax to pvg we dont recommend this flight unless jal changes the configuration on its planes alternatively you should look into flights from lax to narita instead one good thing about flying jal instead of aa out of lax is that as executive platinum member of aa we have access to the qantas first class lounge which is probably the best lounge that i have ever used had we flew aa then we will be out of terminal and only have access to aas admiral flagship lounge which is not nearly as good as the qantas lounge,3
this was the first time i flew in the boeing dreamlinerand i was impressed with the overall spacious cabin and hightech feel of the plane i was slightly disappointed with the seat arrangement in business classbut found the seat to be rather comfortable nonetheless jal has two versions of the boeing the larger one has the jal suite in business class that comes with a more private fully lieflat seat flies to narita tokyo from lax i flew on the smaller version from lax to kansai airport in osaka the seat appears to be the older type business class seat in arrangement and has an angle lie flat seat as expected of any japanese airlines the service was spectacular the stewardess are very attentive and courteous prior to takeoff the chief stewardess goes to each passenger and introduces herself she does the same at the end of the flight asking for any suggestions or comments they are always cheerful and seem to really enjoy their job the food is spectacular they offer both japanese style and western style food i cant say anything about the western style as i ordered japanese style on both trips food is tasty and they give you ample amount of it the seats were comfortable but as most airlines now offer lieflat seats in business class i was surprised that jal didnt do that for all their airplanes but the seat was comfortable enough good thing was that the flight was not full so the stewardess changed my seat to a row all to myself hence i got a window seat and i didnt have to jump over another person to get to the aisle,4
my husband and i recently flew premium economy from boston to tokyo narita on jals new nonstop boeing dreamliner we were pleased not to have to make a connection on the west coast and based on jals excellent reputation were looking forward to a great flight checkin was straightforward and the flight boarded and departed on time the seats were comfortable personal entertainment options plentiful and many amenities provided the flight attendants provided professional yet friendly service for the duration of the flight since neither of us eats meat we ordered a vegetarian meal normally of good to excellent quality on every international flight weve ever flown in this case however the food quality ranged from poor to positively inedible on our flight to tokyo our main meal consisted of curly egg noodles with a tablespoon of thin tomato sauce while on the return flight we were served rice a tvp burger with a speck of ketchup that was as rubbery and tasteless as it appeared it was returned uneaten overall the flight was very good and while we had no complaints except for the food we were quite surprised at just how bad it was if we fly jal again well remember to bring along a plentiful supply of our own food,4
jal have this pretty much to themselves but they did a good job as expected flying an older boeing which was full service was as expected as was the food it was clean and left and arrived on time which is what you can expect with jal which is one of the better airlines,3
this is possibly the most efficient professional and comfortable airline i have ever traveled with they left on time boarded on time landed on time the crew were exceptional it was the fastest boarding i have ever seen check in was smooth and helpful with a great grasp of english highly recommend,5
it was a perfect experience to fly jals domestic flight all the time so just to share my most recent trip here i was travelling with my husband from tokyo haneda to okayama last weekend the flight time was about hours half of the travel time by bullet train shinkansen while the price is almost the same since both of us have joined jals mileage program we used the touch go boarding flow by just tapping the membership cards on the security checkpoint and boarding gate everything was smooth it is so amazing and convenient that you dont need to check in or get a boarding pass when boarding jals domestic flights when we entered the cabin i found jal was providing the cover bags for passengers to wrap their carryon baggage it is such great japanese hospitality every time when i fly with other airlines i try not to put my bag on the floor to avoid getting dirty our seats were at the economy class section all seats are leather seats and clean the legroom is wide enough even i put my bag under the front seat during the flight free drink was offered we liked to try something special so i chose cosome soup while my husband picked their original juice skytime not bad choices as the flight time was quite short we didnt try to sleep my husband read the inflight magazine i was excited to try their free inflight wifi on the day before i found on jals website that they are offering wifi for free on domestic flights i registered the gogo account before the flight as the website suggests it was so easy to get connected than i imagined the speed was fine i just browsed some recommendations on restaurants in okayama the flight landed smoothly and on time the weather in okayama was nice it was really an enjoyable trip with jal,5
this was the first leg of our trip to hanoi and the longest the airplane was brand new and the seats were nice and wide everything was spotlessly clean on the flight even when we landed service was great too,4
i bought my jal ticket from a third party vendor and it was cheap however on the day of the flight i decided to pay one way to upgrade my seat to premium economy it was expensive for a one way upgrade i thought i made the wrong decision but it was not a bad decision as soon as i saw my premium economy seat i thought i was in a business class my seat has a leg rest and it reclines leather seat my own lamp a couple of chargers and outlet the seat is spacious and i still have the space to place my jacket headphone and neckrest the temperature inside the plane was warm no blanket needed bathroom is relatively wider than the other airlines that i had taken the airline offers toothbrush toothpaste and slippers this is the cleanest airline bathroom that i had seen even though it was used by a lot of passengers the food was okay but i wish the airline would offer ramen and tofu ha for a premium seat i was offered wine before and during meal it was a good wine though the only thing that i did not like was the plane that flew us from manila to lax was an american airlines i know that they are partner airlines but i wish it will be jal again tickets are not cheap though but i wish the airline will offer a one day tour of japan i will take jal to my future asian trips,5
it was my first flight with jal ive heard about japanese airlines and i can confirm the service is very friendly the aircraft is super clean organized and new and the highlight beside the service was the food theyve served it was delicious for a economic class i strongly recommend it,5
while the service is wonderful what you come to expect out of a several thousand dollar ticket in business class on a doesnt happen the seats dont lie flat and are horribly uncomfortable for sleeping in your hour min flight window seats are seated next to someone else and are quite narrow tip a is a great seat bulk head so extra leg room but you will have to climb over the person next to you seats are in the sun side of the plane from lax and get quite hot see the pic i posted ask for the window stickers to black out the windows they do exist there arent any actual pull down window shades otherwise only window dimmers food wonderful watch out for shellfish if you have an allergy scallops and lobster in several meals in both the japanese and american meals the japanese noodles with seaweed are pretty good a bit salty from the seaweed but if you want to try your st noodles nows the time and juts push the seaweed to the side if you arent up for the green slime the chocolates are divine,3
i have travelled overseas many a time but to date had never flown jal this time i had the opportunity to fly on jals new dreamliner plane on my own from ny to tokyo business class the plane was magnificent in its internal set up in that despite the seating arrangement in business class in pairs the arrangement was such that the seats were set with a slide up screen between each pair of seats thus providing you with your own private area initially you were provided with a pillow larger than the standard pillow provided and a light weight cotton doing the seats lay completely flat and you were provided with a mattress to put over the seating once you were at a particular height so you could go to sleep each individual unit had all of the standard business class goodies remote control tv with a multiplicity of channels comfortable headphones your own personal lighting system so as not to disturb others the menu provided was amazing allowing you to provide from japanese or western style menu you could order when and what you wanted from the menu at any time during the flight at no particular time were you required to eat but at the mere press of the attendant button you could order food or drinks which were extensive at will the staff right from the moment you joined the check in queue to those who farewelled you at the other end were amazing nothing was too much trouble for them and you were never left to feel like your request was too much to ask for or unnecessary and were answered promptly and graciously all in all the airline and its staff were absolutely wonderful,5
i sat in the middle of persons in a row economy class the guy next to me had to stand up approximately hours due to poor leg room and space between us yet i only weighed lbs,2
this was a very average service that we experienced food was below average service was very slow only thing good was the aircraft was a new dreamlinerthe in flight entertainment had limited choices this is no comparision to ana,3
i have flown on many airlines all over the world and have experienced business and premium classes on some of the finest but jal has eclipsed all of them the cabin restrooms and personal space were all immaculate and restful with attention to such details as to make a very long flight feel relaxed and brief a supplemental mattress for sleep and earphones that actually cancelled out noise and allowed me to hear the films clearly were just two of the welcome appointments the meals were of gourmet quality i chose the japanese menu and found it varied delicious and completely satiating almost a part of the entertainment system as i explored the diverse offerings the two brands of sake offered were both of top quality and nicely complemented the repast but by far the best part of the trip was the hospitality offered by the gracious flight attendants from the moment i boarded to the time i almost reluctantly disembarked though all were faultless i must single out one okubo was absolutely splendid and went above and beyond any expectations i had of gracuoius hosting on an airline it is one thing for an attendant to smile and exercise politeness but for that hospitality to be utterly genuine and emanate from a truly warm person is quite something else while all of my interactions with this caring young woman were highlights of an already exemplary trip i was really touched when she brought me a little package of gifts for my year old step daughter okubo learned i was visiting i wish i could travel everywhere on this airline with this attendant im afraid that jal and okubo have left me quite spoiled i would not hesitate to recommend any of jals international flights particularly for any who might be reluctant to travel so far oh and lest i forget the flight was among the smoothed ever encountered even when we hit a bit of turbulence that would have gone unnoticed had the pilot not told us and lest i forget part the checkin woman in boston was also topnotch,5
jal did everything they could to ensure our holiday was as good as it could be the over and above came as a result of our flights from calgary being overly delayed thanks air canada not sure why hrs late leaving and westjet missing pilot but the jal staff picked up both parties in golf carts and rushed us to the plane which they held as long as they coould the collected our luggage from ac and wj and forwarded it to our hotel in bangkok the next day when we left ko samui bangkok airlines flights were suspended due to rain so we were hours late leaving barely made the jal flight home and they located our luggage from bangkok airways for us and arranged for it to come to calgarysomething they were not responsible for as i wasnt their fault or responsibility they did help they earned my respect for sure the flight itself was amazing staff were terrific service phenomnenal and the food outstanding will definately fly jal again overseas cannot say enough great things about them,5
terrible customer service and experience through the chinese jal service their website offered alipay as a payment and i went through purchase however it took my money and never issued ticket so i called in and rep confirmed that there was a website bug that was not really operational but could not do anything about refund or issue ticket she had all my reservation information but said that it was out of her hands and that i needed to take up the issue of refund directly with alipay she was terribly unhelpful and felt no responsibility to resolve their website blunder,1
im a big fan of jal i fly them frequently and always enjoy their inflight service their ground staff is also very helpful and courteous meals are good and the planes clean and comfortable one of the reasons i love to fly on them is that i feel like im already in japan from the moment i board the plane they are very customer focused and attentive to their guests although the cabin temperature can be warm at times if you mention it to the flight attendants they will make some adjustments to add cooler air to the cabin the only thing that i wished is that they participated in the tsa precheck program fly jal you wont be sorry,5
one word awesome felt like i am at home superb service staff food very good leg space appropriate seats quality very good comfort very good,5
i flied with this airline last year and i really love this company the air crews and ground crews are very friendly and nice the food is very yummy as well,5
the standard on jal was a lovely surprise generous legroom good service and really imaginative food they have clearly given this some time effort involving food stylist nami iijima to create the menus which are tasty fresh salads with tasty dressing wide range of fruit in fruit salads etc other airlines take note,5
the attendants on this flight were so nice and friendly even with a slight language barrier they made sure to ask me like everyone else about drinks food ect they are by far the friendliest airline i have flown i used them in oct as well and service was wonderful then as well,3
this flight was the best we had among other flights we had had from the boarding experience at narita airport to on board service esp flight attendantswas absolutely wonderful while we were boarding there was an attendant who held the sign and guided the business class group so that the line went smotthly the best among the attendants during our flight was mami ito she was very polite and made us feel like customers are kings queens indeed there was another customer who was next to us who was not feeling well and mami treated him very nicely i could tell that the whole staff flight attendants worked non stop to assure the customers were well served we were definitely satisfied with this service and would book ticket from air japan again on the flight back from tokyo to san francisco on united airlines the service was not comparable even though we were on the same business class,5
codeshare flight business travel and the flight was listed as another carrier had a very good meal entertainment options were sound years since my last trip to japan so it was nice to return on this carrier,5
from we used jal usually once a year from australia to europe until we found more competitive airfares on this recent trip melsydtyo overall we found the journey again pleasant the food sydtyo was the best airline meal we have had for years however the return leg main meal was the worst we have had for some time on any airline staff were attentive after lights out continuing to walk the aircraft with liquids for those still awake unlike an australian carrier whose staff have a tendency to disappear after lights out the airline lounge at narita was busy however a pleasant experience for us for older persons a little comfort is appreciated we have not previously used airline lounges,4
purchased business class on sale roundtrip from lax to nrt we live in san jose but the business class prices from sfo were more expensive so used reward points to fly free to lax to take advantage of the business class sale from there amazing service and amenities were a great way to start and finish our trip to japan flew a er roundtrip individual pods with lie flat seats and large privacy partitions between seats excellent space for storing items that you want at hand as well as overhead storage large screen for movies videos etc with great earphones blankets slippers and amenity kits were waiting in our seats when we boarded and cardigans were distributed shortly after takeoff we reserved western and japanese meals ahead of time but my husband and son easily switched to japanese meals for the flight home once boarded also an amazing array of dishes such as sandwiches udon bento box even ice cream available on demand during the flight up to two hours before landing the bathroom was kept spotless with toothbrush kits and mouthwash available at all times what really made the flights stand out was the serviceattentive friendly calm and well organizedwith flight attendants coming to our seats to personally thank each of us for flying arigato jal will definitely fly this airline again,5
very comfortable seat with inch pitch leg roomrated as one of the best airline in economy class service is excellent with all smiling face from air stewardess food and beverage are superb quality of touch screen lcd is very good finally the air ticket price is couple hundred higher than low cost carrier i will continue fly jal,5
this was a good service and the lounge was very good the only down side i thought was that the service was a little lax i think that was mainly due to the hostesss lack of proactivity and being a little shy on arrival in helsinki we received our bags promptly this was a long haul flight and we arrived at the other end feeling fresh and ready to go the main reason to fly business class,4
flown the jal international business class before and was pampered from start to finish got this domestic business ticket for around a yens extra and honestly could not see much difference from an economy seat except that i was asked if i wanted to wrap my check in luggage in a plastic bag when we retrieved our luggage on arrival a ground staff came rushing to help dispose of the plastic bag lounge pass was not included which was a bit disappointed but everything on the light was done in grace and perfection the japanese way,5
super comfortable seat in i have ever got for economy class and the staff is very kind and very goodfoods are very tasty and have nice smell as wellyou can enjoy the world entertainment as well with jal flights from the beginning flight crew trying to give comfortable journey to us highly recommendedcheers,5
when boeings dreamliners first arrived jal jumped at the opportunity to fly directly from tokyo to san diego which has a small airport incapable of handling the big passenger birds of yesterday but jal really screwed up the interior they chose places entertainment equipment boxes under as far as i can tell of the economyclass seats in other words jal went out of its way to cause its passengers on this route hours of pain for tall people it is impossible to sit behind a seat with an entertainment equipment box under it without pinning one foot behind the knee this causes me pain that lasts for days there are other problems the seats themselves are the most uncomfortable seats of any kind i have ever sat in they are worse than bar stools they cause me hamstring and back pain that also lasts for days also the jets interior is beginning to age and look dirty while these flights are an absolutely miserable hours they are still convenient they save time in two ways you do not have to make a stop at another airport and wait around for a connecting flight and san diegos airport gets few international flights so customs and immigration is a breeze plus its san diego the airport is right along the harbor its a beautiful place to step off a plane and the customs and immigration people are san diegans friendly helpful and genuinely happy that you are visiting their city while i cant recommend san diego enough as an international destination for anyone living in tokyo jal really needs to remodel the interior of its nrtsan dreamliner and make it not so painful one more note since jal has a monopoly on this route its super expensive if you have the time youre much better off taking united and transferring in sfo,3
like most japanese companies jal tries really hard to give good service to its customers jal tries too hard on its overnight flights from tokyo to bangkok this is about a sevenhour flight that leaves haneda airport at just after midnight the airplanes interior is brand new seat pockets fit more stuff inside them there seems to be more leg room i saw no entertainment equipment boxes under seats these hard metallic immovable boxes can ruin a flight by pinning your foot behind your knee if you are tall you will feel the pain for days after disembarking so cheers for jal getting rid of these damn boxes on its midnight hndbkk route but why ruin the effort and all that added comfort by turning up the lights two hours before arrival to feed us a meal of flapdoodle airline food let your customers sleep on overnight flights jal dont force us to eat unneeded carbs at oclock in the morning tokyo time and cause all kinds of commotion on a previously quiet flight one more note the new seats are mostly great but the bottoms curve up in the back and jab your tailbone the seats also seem to angle downward which keeps passengers sliding forward this runs from being unpleasant to annoying to painful,1
this was my first flight experience with japan airlines jal one of the reasons i chose this airlines because they landed in tokyo international airport haneda instead of narita the inflight services were nice i remembered we were served a cute japanese bento for inflight meal they also provided various alcoholic and nonalcholic beverages during the flight imo the most useful benefit when traveling with jal was the free wifi connection in japan provided by ntteast and wi wifi to use this service you need to register on jal website and provide your ticket information the wifi connection can be accessed easily by using the travel japan wifi app,4
the entire experience was a pleasure a great advertisement for japan courtesy and service all the way the best airline i have ever flown with ba and us airlines should take note,5
a very pleasant day flight check in and security were very polite and calm the seating was comfortable and the entertainment varied a worked faultlessly the cabin crew were the picture or cheerful caring polite as and the menu options wide to cater for most tastes the asian option hovered on gourmet standard well worth it and we will use the airline again,5
fly jal it might be worth it to depart from a city that has the jal boeing dreamliner if your city doesnt great food lots of seat room even in regular class seating high ceilings lots of air circulation lots of free movies lots of carryon luggage space neck pillow you wont need to bring one and blanket complimentary toothbrush toothpaste in the clean and fresh smelling washrooms quiet super friendly i could live on there for a month with no complaints seriously if possible fly jal i wrote some tips for travelling in japan,5
their is no way on earth we would have been able to afford such luxury without using miles a year ago i booked flights from cvg to ord on american airlines first class and then on to nrt first from ord jal and then on to bangkok jal biz the leg from chicago to tokyo was one of the high points of my flying experiences there are suites on the and only four including my wife and i were occupied since it was new years eve the whole plane was only about half full the fas were fantastically attentive the food especially the japanese items was over the top great you could order what you wanted when you wanted each passenger got one of the other suites made up into a bed so there was no inconvenience of having to transition between bed and chair i know i know fwp we did have to spend a hour layover at haneda at the excel airport hotel after a minute shuttle bus ride but what the heck today we flew from haneda to bkk biz on a the service was also great just not as luxurious and over the top as the hrs in first the food was very good salmon and pasta with one of the best deserts i ever had a green tea custard with white chocolate hollow balls filled with some kind of green tea syrup wow knock your socks off good the whole trip was booked with aa miles each before the aa devaluation early we used mile value booking service for each and worth every penny,5
flew jal vancouver to narita round trip jl jl both were on the b dreamliner which is a very nice newish plane with mood lighting larger windows very quiet generous overhead bins and toilets with the sprayer function common in japan unfortunately jal opted for angle flat seats on these overnight flights so sleep is not as comfortable as most other major international airline business class i find i do tend to slide down the angle flat bed but width and comfort of the seat was generally good entertainment is ok but there is slightly less selection of movies and programs than for example on cathay pacific the real strength of jal however is in the service the flight attendants are constantly working go about their duties quietly and with elegance and make you feel truly well cared for during the flight they are also constantly cleaning the toilets which on a longhaul flight makes a big difference to the comfort of using the washrooms food is also very good on jal i tried both the japanese meal and the western meal both are very strong the japanese meal typically starts with a box containing different little appetizers always intriguing and interesting but difficult to remember which is which after reading the detailed descriptions in the menu the western meal that i remember was shortribs and it was succulent and tender japan airlines also serves a special coffee in business class and in its lounges which is really delicious probably the best coffee i have had on any airline but unfortunately is exclusive to their flights and lounges and not sold i asked and it is not available as part of their in flight sales i also used the lounges in vancouver it is unfortunately just the plaza premium lounge which is open to membership subscriptions or drop ins and is crowded and not very nice however in narita i used the first class lounge as i have one world alliance status and it is a superb lounge elegant and understated as is the japanese way with two sushi chefs making sushi to order a buffet area with western and japanesechinese food massage chairs and also massage therapists for quick minute massage treatments the lounge also served high quality suntory whiskeys which are very enjoyable when one flies japan airlines whether on the ground or in the air the one thing that you can rely on is superb attentive and elegant service at a level head and shoulder above western airlines,5
i was surprised to be served hot dogs on japan airline in my flight from chicago to manila with no choice for an asian food option in flying to manila eva air and asiana both had much better food otherwise everything was alright,3
i booked my flight from tokyo to bangkok in business class and the experience was not a good one no one on business class was offered a drink or towel i had high expectations from this airline and service and i dont justified the ticket cost for their service i should flight economy for the kind of service i did experience,2
top notch highly efficient boarding process welcome towel beverage meals that would put a lot of restaurants to shame super attentive and friendly staff whom go out of their way for your comfort cabin is nice and quiet the most amount of entertainment ive ever seen on a plane to summarise this airline they took out seats from the cabin to create more leg room and comfort for passengers i cant imagine many other airlines that would sacrifice and do this,5
great experience with japan airlines jal flight from london to tokyo and return i normally select ba but ive had some poor experiences on different routes so i decided to try jal i was not looking forward to the long flight time travelling in economy however it was a super experience at both airports the staff at the checkin desk were professional and welcoming at haneda they greeted passengers from the queue taking them to the checkin desk onboard the crew were professional polite and attentive economy seats comfortable and more spacious plane and all the facilities were very clean and frequently cleaned meals served efficiently but with a personal service snacks and additional drinks available throughout the flight return flight i bought an upgrade to premium economy at the airport the seats have more space between them and foot rest seats dont recline backwards so you are not being crushed by the passenger in fronts seat also a larger tv screen special thanks to colin and federico for service on return flight both flights great experience i will definitely be choosing jal again,5
on the way back from japan the flight left about minutes late and we arrived about minutes late apart from that the service was faultless and the enternainment was very good as always on jal the crew were very pleasant and helpful flying them again for sure,4
flew back from tokyo after a crap trip over from ba contrast could not have been greater wonderful attentive and courteous service good food and a very comfortable seating flight on time well done jal you can have my custom any day,5
a very good airline check in was efficient although there were many passenger in line cabin crew was top rate and was always friendly and smiling service was incredible and this is one cabin crew that works almost all the time without rest flight was smooth with some turbulence but nothing major in flight food was good from narita to klia but the same cant be said for klia to narita leg most likely due to local caters and not jals fault overall a superb airline,5
when we boarded we were given a very warm welcome and they helped us put our luggage in the bins and guided us to our seats great take off and breakfast was above average for airline food inflight entertainment was extensive and good showing a good range of movies and tv shows crew were very friendly and cheery when we landed we forgot our passports on the plane and the crew kept hold of them and waited outside of the plane for us to return which we did we are flying with them again in jan and would highly recommend them to anyone,5
very comfortable flight even economy class and very friendly crew in flightfoods are excellent and tasty,5
jal was a short one hour flight from shirahama to tokyo on an emraer which was clean and neat and the flight service was very good as expected despite a late incoming flight departed and arrived on time and the luggage appeared within ten minutes which is a feature of jal in tokyo and haneda no food but just a cold drink but that was fine overall jal using one of the subsiduaries j airlines did a very good job,4
i was fly from kul to nrt by brand new aircraft b then transit to osaka itami by domestic aircraft b overall the journey was great and no complain at all becuase i can see how they treatserve with smile as you can see from the heart i can see quality of service here in everything from checkin until arrive at osaka my son also can choose his own like toy with is complementary from airline good job to japan airline,5
my girlfriend was very rudely refused boarding on a flight to japan a mean faced attendant stopped her at the gate and demanded she show proof of onward travel we only had way tickets since we were staying abroad for months and did not have solid plans on when we would return i was able to check in fine and had to run back to the gate to see what happened luckily we had data connection on our phones and quickly purchased cheap plane tickets to appease the rude attendant it was all very stressful and we almost missed our international flight seems absurd as we were flying business class and they didnt ask me a male anything about my onward travel plans asian cultures are known for female inequality but this was absurd the plane was comfortable but this whole ordeal ruined our experience i contacted their customer support and received some canned apology which seemed very insincere,1
the cabin crew hospitality and meals made us comfortable throughout the trip there is ample legroom for you to stretch your leg the kids will even get a selection of toys during the journey even if there is an error during your checking in just let the airline counter knows and they will sort it out for you i had encountered that my seat does not tally with my online booking however the counter is able to rectify it and solve the problem for me,5
whether its in the air or on the groundyou have to love the way the japanese approach their clients i dont particularly care if its genuine or just a conditioned way of being but i do have to say i enjoy it everyone i encountered during my whole jal flight made my trip a pleasure,4
it was hours and minutes flight from ckg to narita transit for and minutes then another hours flight from narita to jfk yet cabin crew hospitality and good meals made us comfortable nice experience in our first flight with jal hope well get the same or even better experience on our flight back home next year,4
was amazing trip also no complain becuase i can see how they treatserve with smile as you can see from the heartrecommended to all passenger traveling anywhere with this airline i can see quality here in everything around,5
great service best food especially creme brulee icecream comfortable seat nice flight attendants,5
great service from cabin crews sleep well and enjoy dilicious food especially icecream about the plane is new and wide enough space for long leg,5
travelled on jl yesterday via b with their new y class seats flight was full in classes ground technical staff bid us farewell while plane was preparing for take off cabin crew did one round of drinks it has more seat pitch i have travelled with their previous y class and felt that there was little padding in their new y class seats inflight camera was not available however foc wifi was available for mins flight arrived on time thumbs up,5
my family and i miss the am flight to haneda and were placed for standby flights we had a international flight the checkin ladies were nice the senior and other ground staff trying to help one of the ladies personally escorted us to the standby counter at the dep area my elder daughter and i were placed at the am informed at am and managed to check in all bags with priority tags while my wife and younger daughter were placed at the am flight bound for fukuoka the ground staff personally escorted with a smile my elder daughter and i to the gate running together to the gate thumbs up we made it back home thank you,5
this is the second time my husband and i have flown jal to manila philippines their lounge is exceptional service on the airplane equally so we will keep on flying this airline they make the long trip very comfortable,5
crew for this flight always give a great smiles to passenger and welcome gift are provided to child stewardess did their job very well they served verity of drinks to passenger all the times,3
flight was on time seats were comfortable and and food and drinks served were also good nice experience,4
this was a good flight on a new boeing which left on time and arrived on timeas we were upgraded from economy to business without requesting it there were no complaints and thes service was a good standard as always on jal the staff are very good,4
this airline does everything right the service is number one of all airlines the food is good and thoughtfully accessible drinks like all top airlines planes comfort and media standardly very good this airline is far superior to american delta united cathay swiss international british and several smaller airlines i have flown each in the last months emirates is better than japan except for service japan is number one in customer service i have not seen anything that comes close,5
we were unable to upgrade to j class for a fee of as the flight was full we checked in early and was informed flight was delayed for mins due to aircraft change no issues as there were several shops and eatery at haneda terminal for jal travelled in their new y class in b their tables seems to be made of a lighter material better seat pitch however the seats has little padding i like their cabin flights and cherry coloured seat belts instead of the usual black grey one round of drins were served in the min full flight the cabin crew even found my face mist bottle cap for me when i drop it on the floor impressive,5
compared to european airlines the staff was really friendly and polite the food was quite good the plane was very clean inside including toilets also check in on narita was ok the only disadvantage was rather poor movie choice,4
i was gooing from yvr to manila phillppines wen i bordede the airplane it was a litle small leg space but the it was a smove ride,3
great airline plane was comfortable and clean staff as with all japanese people were pleasant and very helpful at check in same with the flight crew no movies for this quick trip but allowed a short time to catch up on much needed sleep will look at flying with jal for my next return trip to japan,5
this was my first time flying to and from japan on jal and it was a very positive experience the service staff was super friendly and tried to do everything they could to ensure that the customers on the plane had an enjoyable flight they experienced inflight entertainment issues the entire flight home from tokyo but did their best to recover service to the best of their ability unfortunately we had seats next to an arrogant person who was demanding and felt very entitled he couldnt stop yellingcomplaining to every flight attendant on the plane about how the movies didnt work and how he wanted a refund for him and his family felt horrible for the flight attendants to have to deal with a person like this let alone him waking us up every time he would raise his voice to try and get something for free,4
jal must surely be the worlds best airline its planes are immaculately maintained and its cabins clean and comfortable as comfortable as flying can be staff are professional always helpful and bilingual in japanese and english food is a choice of japanese or european this is high class airline that is a credit to japan,5
top notch service from jal staff to and fro our international trip so much priority given to us as we were traveling with our yearold sonlove it very attentive and helpful all throughout and most of the flight attendants were super sweet to my son on the st flight from dallas to narita we had chatted with one of the flight attendants annabella about our sons upcoming nd birthday that same weekend later on she surprised him with a little gift bag filled with goodies and small toys and a personalized note wishing him a happy birthday that was sweet beyond words and meant a lot to us thank you oh flying on the magnificent dreamliner is amazing more room in general for the entire cabin and leg room at the seats and not filling like were cramped sardines in a tin can as long as we can get great deals we will definitely be flying this route with jal again,5
i flew jal business class from tokyo to helsinki the staff were very attentive and friendly the plane felt new and the interior was clean the cabin was kept very clean during the entire flight my seat was an aisle seat in the middle section in seats the layout is such that the window seat has its own little passageway so it would have been just as good as an aisle but with more privacy the access to my seat was wide open on the aisle side too wide so it felt a little too exposed there was a retractable blind blocking the other person next to me so it was private on that side there is also a foam mattress for every seat that the flight attendant will prepare so it is really comfortable to sleep and then you dont feel all the usual cracks and bends characterizing todays business class seats i had preordered a vegetarian meal and i was happy i did that the main course otherwise would have been beef tongue and something more western but the fact that beef tongue was the headline meal was a little shocking for me anyway my meal had the best salad onboard i have ever had both in presentation and quality and the attendant tailored the offering to consider other food sensitivities and preferences i had in addition to the wines fine sake was offered so it was interesting to try those the inflight entertainment is much more limited than other airlines there were not so many films to choose from screen and headphone quality was good when we arrived in helsinki this huge plane was parked out away from the terminal we had to walk down portable stairs and board a bus that would have been really miserable in bad weather i didnt like helsinki airport at all or the connecting finnair flight jal business class passengers had to queue for the security check in line with everyone there was not any express or priority line,4
after terrible flight to tokyo made by finnair and airbus i experienced great flight from tokyo part of very good experiences were because of the plane boeing which was really comfortable and spacious service was excellent food tasty and online entertainment good as well i think it was my best long haul experience in my life,5
we originally booked on another airline for this tip but then jal had a special offer of around us for round trip business class which was a rather good deal so we switched service starts at the check in upon seeing a dent on one of our luggages the check in staff offered to wrap our luggage in a plastic bag something that not all airlines will do even for business class we were offered access to the qantas lounge but we used the new cx lounge instead it was busy but staff was efficient service on board was great they dont serve pretake off drink which is a bit odd but no big deal no amenity kits were offered on this regional flight but there was a pair of slippers in each seat and one of the flight attendants came by with a tray offering eye mask and ear plugs lunch order was taken shortly after the seat belt sign went off i opted for the japanese set presentation was great and the taste was even better the seat was an angled lie flat one which is more than enough for a hrs flight ife was nice with a selection of japanese and english movies and tv programs quite surprised that they offer season of er so nice to watch an episode of the classic show jal business product seat ife may not be as good when compared to other airlines on this regional route but what they lack in hardware they make it up with customer services and catering,5
we were flying from narita airport to jakarta on our th wedding anniversary celebration trip to southeast asia on september in view of the delay of our previous flight we barely made it and our suitcases didnt aside from the good service we received on board from misses katsuyama hirose and krissamon including a nice handwritten card with wine and sweets to celebrate our anniversary they were able during the flight to confirm that our bags would put on the same flight the following day and delivered to our hotel jw marriott hotel jakarta which was the case on arrival in jakarta we were met by jl ground staff headed by miss rheta who kindly escorted us through immigration and customs helped us with the form for our delayed suitcases and provided us with a prepared envelope containing cash to cover minimum expenses toiletries essential clothing etc all of these showed the concern of japan airlines and its staff over the inconvenience,5
on our th wedding anniversary celebration trip to southeast asia on september our flight from san diego to tokyo jl was delayed at departure leaving little time to make our connecting flight from narita airport to jakarta jl sept aside from the excellent service we received from chief purser takebe ayame assisted by flight attendants koiwai fukunaga and patt takebe including a beautiful handwritten card with wine and chocolates to celebrate our anniversary miss ayame was able to confirm during the flight that we would be personally met on arrival and escorted to our connecting flight to jakarta which was the case,5
the latest economy class was more comfort than ever with wider leg space usb port wifi and new flight entertainment system etc it is fair to flight up up to hours,5
boarding was a breeze and on time all loaded up and off we were great flight plenty to do and super meals along the way crew was marvelous and supportive of all my needs,5
boarding was fast and efficient long flight but a good one great staff service and care very clean plane,5
amazed the plane was so very very clean and the staff are extremely accommodating great meals and in flight care from the flight crew,5
this is one of the best flight i have even enjoyed great service plenty of leg room and delicious food the crew was amazing,5
flew sinnrthnl and back with my husband on the er our seats in business were the jal sky suite ii type throughout service as expected was superb and intuitive the purser and attendants make it a point to address us by name bathrooms were cleaned after every use and toothbrushes packet mouthwash beautifully presented for the next passenger every five minutes or so an attendant would walk through the cabin and look to be of service the us airlines cant compare with this attention to detail dining was served in courses unlike delta business but food western japanese was not exceptional two big gripes were the actual jal sky suite ii bed hard as a rock narrow and no space to turn your feet when in bedmode will never fly with this product ever again the jal sky suite iii which wasnt available for our trip is much much better for comfort other problem was the warm cabin it was probably the warmest cabins ive ever flown in attendants obliged with turning the ac down a notch but it was still uncomfortable that said our next flight is on ana again service superb on the ground and inflight avoid the jal sky suite ii and if they could fix the warm cabins id give the airline five stars jal lounge in narita was fantastic though nap rooms wonderful shower facilities lovely spread of food massage chairs all add up to a great transit experience,4
very japanese in terms of politeness cleanliness and timeliness and now for the surprise very warm and friendly service at the checkin and inflight i dont do this often but this one i would recommend for sure well done jal,5
i had very bad experience during web check in terrible experience the web interface is so old fashion not user friendly and has missing data which i keyed in many times earlier my friend and i passengers were allocated in the centre seater by the system in fact there were still availabilities at the seater at the side i had a special meal request on this flight after dinners all passengers were given a tub of ice cream when it was my turn the air stewardess took it back and told the ice cream was not for special meal i was so surprised i then asked if she had extra without further thinking she responded no harsh and hostile the aircraft is an old the seat cushion is so worn that i hardly felt any soft yet firm support food debris was found on the floor at the sides obviously the cleaners didnt do a good job during their regular cleaning the bread served was as hard as a rock also they do not serve butter with the bread you have to ask for it overall my experience with japan airlines is not so appealing,2
requested an aisle seat on checkin but due to full capacity none was available the checkin counter staff kindly made arrangements to be upgraded to premium economy for free without me requesting to be upgraded the upgrade was a pleasant surprise and made for a very pleasant journey hours the seat has a lot of legroom and at i could stretch out as much as i wanted to without issue the seats dont recline but rather slide down and forward which is great as it doesnt bother the passenger behind there is a leg support that comes up from the bottom of the seat and also a foot rest the foot well had a lot of space so even with my shoes off and stored there i could sit comfortably the seats have a double arm rest each so theres no issues as to who gets to use it allowing for all passengers in this class to sit and move around in the seat without disturbing the person alongside food was okay and inflight entertainment was also fine controlled by either touchscreen or controller cas were very professional courteous helpful and always smiling which really does make for a pleasant atmosphere upgrade to premium economy varies on distance syd to nrt would have been yen which really adds up on a return journey but some shorter flights to asian destinations hk can be had for just yen each way which i wouldnt hesitate to pay for great seat great service and made a hour fight pleasant as opposed to bearable highly recommend flying jal and premium economy i wouldnt even bother with paying for business class if a premium economy seat is available as the extra cost isnt justified considering how comfortable the seating was,5
flew economy on this flight and as im rather tall i requested an aisle seat to allow me to stretch out as it was an overnight flight on checkin i was informed that the flight was fully booked so no aisle seats were available but should one become available theyd let me know at the departure gate just prior to boarding i didnt expect one to become available and if it did i didnt expect them to go through the trouble of assigning one to me much to my pleasant surprise i was informed at boarding one was available and was assigned it thats an example of great service by staff who are already very busy it made the flight much more comfortable the seat was a sky wider seat and one of the most spacious for an economy class ive flown on long distance at i had no issues with leg room and the usb charger was very convenient food was okay but the cas were very friendlycourteous and professional i hadnt much considered flying jal before but theyre now the first airline ill look to fly with,4
jal operate their boeing dreamliner on this flight to san diego and back and it is a good service and the best way to enter the us and avoid the lines in us immigration in lax the officers in san diego are quite civil the flight leaves at pm and gets in around pm along with all other inbound flights from the us the service on jal is at their top level and food is good although the aircraft has the older style business class seats,4
when do you know you got best deal when you are in trouble and airlines help you that is what happened to me on nov when i missed my flight cause hotel did not do wake up call i explained to jal counter staff what happened and they knew there it was nothing on my side i could do more to be on time i was given new flightbut it was explained to me that is it special case which i understand and am grateful thanks to jal i could get back home my friends missed flight as well but they were with singapore airlines but no luck since singapore airlines did not help them at all so as you can see it does make a difference which airlines you fly i fly japan airlines on top of that you get two pieces of luggage plenty leg room new planes flight attendants with smile,5
i flew japan airlines flight from chicago ohare direct to tokyo narita and then continued on jal to osaka itami i paid extra for premium economy for the hour ord nar flight the extra expense was definitely worth the price you get a little more seat width massive amount of leg room and slightly better fooddrink choices the staff on this flight were very very nice ive also flown this route on united while there staff were also pleasant they never seemed as gracious as the japan airlines ladies at the end of the flight my flight attendant stopped by every passenger and personally thanked them for flying their airline she also asked if they needed anything right before landing entertainment options were decent i thought there would be more but the options were fine several recent english language movies several music channels although most seemed to be japanese there was also a daily minute news program focused on international news im not sure if regular economy people get them but our seats included complementary noise cancelling headphones nothing extravagant sony brand but a nice amenity nonetheless i think i had unreasonably high expectations for this airline i heard that its such a great option from usa to japan i sort of built it up to be this amazing experience it is certainly a nice airline but im not sure its any better than ana i just dont know what i can say is that this airline and this flight was really nice premium economy made the flight more bearable lets me real though the trip is not enjoyable unless you have a lieflat bed in business or first class which is very expensive but by looking at the people in regular coach i think i would have been in hell had i not paid the extra money for premium economy i recommend this to anyone who is tall or overweight or who just doesnt enjoy very long flights,4
good service smooth checkin comfortable seat nice aircraft most like the service and japanese hospitality but not many kind of beverages no foodit would be nice if they could serve a sandwich or cakemuffin for the price of the ticket,3
i was originally booked on jclass japan airlines domestic business class but for roughly usd i was able to upgrade to a firstclass seat on the day of departure you are entitled to a use of their diamond premier lounge and you can enter through their first class checkin room which is connected to their own security screening area the lounge has private seating areas where you can rest or catch up on your work with minimal interruption they also provide a selection of beverages food and snacks but dont dont go overboard and fill yourself up because the first class service provides warm meals upon departure the only class of service that provides meals on domestic flights as a first class passenger i was invited to board first along with their status holders there were total first class seats all with beige leather seating and a lot of leg room the food was very beautifully presented and they were of high quality the cabin attendants were very professional and welcoming and made the short flight a very memorable one,5
the jal airfare was a couple hundred dollars higher than united and other airlines but worth it our economy seats were extremely comfortable we are short people so we had no issues with legroom overall jals economy seats were much better than premium economy on united we had two full meals service was attentive and though the flight was over hours it did not seem that long,5
pampered luxury even in business class not worth the extra expense suffer for ten hours save eight grand,4
great service seat are comfortable food is ok very good help when needed to change ticket even though we had to pay extra still very happy,5
whenever possible i try to fly topquality national airlines flew jal jl this week superb service from checkin to first class lounge to business class travel amenities are superb staff is incredibly warm friendly and attentive new aircraft too few restrooms which was very comfortable any needs could be addressed by a new handheld pad duty free entertainment meals and snacks i really enjoyed the flexibility of the service the japanese and western meal options are very nice i always prefer the japanese meal seats incredibly firm and comfortable for a restful sleep a truly grand experience and lovely trip to the us following nearly two weeks of travel,5
think about everything you like when youre on a long flight you like good food check nice customer service check inflight entertainment check theres not a bad thing to say about jal youll have the smoothest and most comfortable flight ever,5
i always enjoy flying with japanese airlines great service and very helpful staff the only drawback is difficulties with their internet pages when you do not read japanese it might also be a inconvinient to travel from narita to the hotels i tokyo,5
customer service was amazing attendants were so attentive throughout the entire flight i asked for a little taste of two types of saki the attendant brought and left me the two entire bottles seat and ife controls were extremely easy to use great flight,5
excellent service very friendly staff on board cceptable leg room for hrs jal my favorite airline,5
probably one of the best airlines nowadays much improvement since last time i flew with them years ago impeccably clean cabin great comfortable seats they even give ergonomic pillows which allows you to sleep comfortably when seated without a problem the most fantastic food selection ive ever seen fresh tasty food and great selection of drinks which they serve during an entire flight the stewardess was constantly walking with a teapot even when most passengers were asleep checking in case somebody wants fresh tea and they do not economize on food they served premium häagendazs ice cream great movie selection as well overall the best the most attentive and friendly service onboard ive ever seen,5
this flight uses a with across seating in coach american airlines uses across seating the difference on a to hour flight like this is significant i have experienced the difference personally in august i flew americans from tokyo haneda to lax and in may i flew americans between dfw and santiago chile also the flight attendants were all excellent as expected with jal if you can avoid american airlines on this route my return to dfw the following week was on this aircraft with their new across seating in the main cabin the aisles are so small that the larger flight attendants have to move at an angle down the aisles plus the usual so so service avoid aa and fly japan airlines,5
weve flown on many airlines but this one might very well be the very best we ever flown the service is phenomenal from the way they check you in it is extremely respectful and formalized it is so refreshing to have a passport returned to you with both hands and a verbal thank you the service onboard is fantastic you can see that everything the flight attendants do is to make your flight a positive memorable one the beverages are nonstop so you wont have to worry about staying hydrated legroom is not an issue you can get out of the window seat without having to ask the person on the aisle to get up because of all the legroom in premium economy even the small things are noticeable in japan the checkin agent comes out from the counter to the line and asks you to come to their numbered location and on departure the ground crew came out and formed a three person line and waived and bowed while the plane taxied out they do it right if you ever have a need to fly to the far east i would definitely say i look forward to flying on jal when we go back to china next year,5
first time flying with jal and i cannot fault them this is the most leg room i have ever had in any economy seat the food was plentiful with small dishes as well as a main course service was impeccable the flight home via frankfurt was just as good although the plane was a different set up,5
my wife and i took our nd trip to indonesia flying with an asian airline this time it was with jal we booked our trip months in advance and got an awesome rate less than round trip for both of us jal had great service entertainment and food the american airlines could learn a few things from jal my only concern was jal has a day prior to take off policy to select your seats better mark your calendar or you could forget to select your seats and get something that is not desirable on our leg from tokyo to jakarta we were asked if we wanted seats closer to the front so we said yes the plane was not full and we sat in the row right behind first class wonderful service we will fly with jal in the future,5
really enjoyed this flight lots of space and legroom drinks served regularly both alcoholic and soft food the best ive ever eaten on a plane cabin crew courteous and attentive inflight entertainment great infact i cannot fault this airline,5
wow wow wow what a surprise i have flown many airlines over airlines for the past decades in asia us europe australia nz the best domestic airline in the us virgin america was an instant winner for me when i first flew within them yrs ago in the us in asia i am loyal to qantas naturally as i am from australia you heard a lot of publicity about the singapore airlines for its sevive quality but cant be compared to jal today i flew with them about yrs ago and the service was bad really bad as bad as us domestic airlines but what surprised me is that jal has reinvent itself totally from the time we checkin i was with my parents on wheelchair to leading us into our seats incredibly nice polite service that i cannot find in any other airlines the attention to details cannot exist in todays cut throat industry wow if u find similar services level in the us or in any country i would love to know,5
this was our first flight ever on jal so far we had flown mostly on western airlines european and north american it exceeded our expectation with excellent timeliness very kind and helpful personnel food was superb with choice between japanese and western anytime we return to japan jap will be our first option,5
after a horrible experience with china airlines flying japan airlines has been a breath of fresh air they really know how to do customer service right i am pregnant and had shown a letter stating that i am safe to fly when checking in other than that i never mentioned it to anyone they gave me priority boarding when my husband and i were seated we had two middle seats with a disabled lady on one side so a bit difficult to get out of we never complained at all but after takeoff the flight attendant came and asked us to move we couldnt quite catch everything she said due to the noise but two employees switched seats with us so that we could move to two seats on one side together with more room and easier access amazing she later gave us an extra bag of snacks and repeatedly checked that we were alright at the end of the flight she even came by with a gift for your baby a little fork and spoon set in a cute japan airlines carrying case so considerate we flew back again and we were just treated so considerately by all personnel we will now go out if our way to fly jal every chance we get in the future thank you,5
it was our first trip travelling in japan airlines business class and the experience was extremely good it started from the sakura lounge the food was good and we love the curry rice and cold green tea the aircraft during that time was still the old jal has since september changed to dreamliner was was fitted with their new business class sky suite seats the seat was comfortable and fully flat even though jal didnt give any pouch but their have distributed very comfortable pyjama and toiletries like eye and facial masks the all new meal menu and alcohol selections were excellent and i would like to specially mentioned that even though it was a hour journal the air stewardess didnt stop patrolling around and attended to any request from the customers it was indeed a very pleasant flight,5
ive flown many of the airlines in the world including most middleeastern airlines and jal is the best jal is the one airline i feel cares about its passengers the service is outstanding the food is actually delicious and the seats are comfortable with tons of space in fact on the they removed a seat so its a configuration instead of on all other airlines so there is much more space all around cant wait to fly with them again,5
not only is this the only airline flying direct from bos to nrt it has the best service and equipment of the reasonable possibilities for this route the service and food is impeccable,4
what a fantastic experience comfort level was exemplary with lieflat beds and superb privacy access to the aisle is easy from any seat unlike ba the food service and inflight entertainment were superb with good levels of choice and quality the dineanytime option was a touch of class and every member of staff were friendly courteous and efficient jal jclass rocks also the sakura lounge in tokyo was superb with amazing shower and relaxation facilities,5
premium economy seat is roughly equivalent to first class seat on or md the seat does not lie flat a recline that is close to degrees leg room is very good i ordered a kosher meal for both flights and i must say the meal was very good bbq chicken and rice for dinner and omelette for lunchbreakfast salmon on the way back was very good noise cancelling headphones were a nice touch the movie inventory wasnt very good and not everything is in english probably my biggest complaint dimming windows worked well generally the service was very good probably not far off of singapore air or swiss two of my favorites the better air quality on the was much more comfortable than other planes i highly recommend the for long haul for this reason alone on departure i got a comp invite to airline lounge which was a nice touch,4
ac was totally inoperative seats are narrower than any other airline i have ever been on seat was broke whenever i leaned back it would fall back all the way the staff could not fix it after hours of this they made me move before landing because my seat was unsafe,1
ive been flying jal executive class since the service is in keeping with the same high standard one experiences throughout japan the sky suites are thoughtfully designed we all know that the japanese are experts at maximising space huge tv screens that dont need to be flipped out and replaced space for putting items where they can be reached magazine holders and somewhere to put rubbish are all very welcome on a long flight compared to most of the other business class cabins ive tried on other airlines they are far superior except for their food the menu is designed by someone who is attempting to be creative and innovative and is failing miserably there are a few nice items but most is inedible my sixteen year old son who us usually ravenous refuses to eat anything other than the rice the other problem is that they dont serve breakfast at the end of an overnight flight they serve food but i wish theyd learn from ither airlines and iffer breakfast foods at breakfast time they need to replace their caterers then theyll be perfect,4
our flight left almost an hour late am so we were not even offered a meal the service level was indifferent and prior to our arrival the european breakfast offered was very poor the flat beds are okay but nothing special the return flight from narita also left an hour late once again the service level was indifferent and i had to wait half an hour after my wife was served to get my meal even though our orders were taken at the same time i will give jal a miss for a while or until their standards have improved,3
very pleasant flight from jfk to nrt despite the long duration ontime departure slightly early arrival very friendly service good choices of japanese and western food and a nice feature after the main dinner one could order diverse food items as one wished and pretty much at any time there was some period where this service was not available the business class seats offered decent comfort and privacy and the flight attendants where thrilled by my attempts to speak japanese overall a very nice travel experience,4
the seating was old and so was the aircraft boeing and the service and food did not match the aircraft or the service from wither europe or us jal appear to set the food standard to match competition and although the food was very well presented i have had a lot better the staff are always friendly and courteous,3
japan airlines has always been famous for its good service and this flight does not disappoint even with a nearly full cabin the service is still attentive and warm food is as usual quite good for breakfast since i wasnt particularly hungry i was going to choose the western option but the flight attendant talked me into going japanese the grilled pacific saury she told me is a particular seasonal specialty it was delicious and i was glad she took the time to inform me of it the only item that could make this flight better is if jal changes the business class to their sky suite configuration nevertheless i was able to sleep a couple hours on this flight,5
after our super stay at club med hokkaido we were flying to tokyo to spend days there after a smooth checkin we had some very good food at the airport restaurant the flight was on time short smooth and comfortable my kids complained about no inflight tv but managed to keep them occupied nonetheless,4
after reaching tokyo on an overnight jal flight from singapore we took this domestic flight to hokkaido though we had checked in our luggage straight through to hokkaido we still had to do it again in tokyo that was strange it was a long journey in haneda airport to the domestic section we stopped at the lounge which was spacious but the food was average the flight was short and quick obihiro airport is small quaint seeing the snow was exciting getting us ready for our ski holiday at club med,4
it was our first time to fly jal the service was great and staffs were friendly the food and beverage was better than other airlines i will use this their service very soon,4
we were on a family holiday with friends to club med hokkaido to ski jal leaves from t in changi singapore though we went to the lounge our kids saw the play area nearby and after a quick bite we went there it was an overnight flight and though the food was tempting we all slept the service was good and the seats comfortable we landed fresh the next morning in tokyo for our domestic connection to hokkaido,4
this trip was on a jal has removed a seat to allow for wider bodies in the seats that made the hour flight bearable the service from the flight crew was amazing they were super professional i did bring a cpap machine along so i could sleep on the flight my machine caused them considerable concern and they woke me up a few times asking to look at it they finally decided it was something i could use on the plane and left me alone i did show them the sticker saying it was approved by the faa for use on aircraft but i am not sure they understood that the interface for games and movies was a bit more modern than i am used to they had a great selection i think this must have been a newer plane,4
an excellent flight with a pleasant staff at all points in the trip it was a fairly crowded aircraft but still pleasant none the less ground crew were courteous and helpful,5
i picked jal based on youtube videos i saw where their economy class seats had plenty of legroom imagine my surprise when i got on the plane los angeles to osaka and saw how cramped and small the seats were i used to be one of those people who didnt understand why passengers fought over reclining seats after flying jal i see why the woman in the seat in front of me extended her seat all the way back which took up all my personal space i literally wanted to push her and the seat out of frustration with her seat fully extended i couldnt get out of my seat to use the restroom so i had to hold on to her seat in order to get up which im sure it annoyed her but oh well also while trying to stretch i accidentally kicked the feet of the woman sitting in front of me theres not even enough room to stretch while seated unless youre a really short person i for the record am the seats were on this flight my friend and i sat in the row with seats the food was quite tasty the flight attendants were very friendly the ones who werent fluent in english tended hand me things and run away the flight attendants who are fluent in english took their time explaining things to me i really loved the fact that jal darken out the windows so that people can sleep after they serve the first meal this was my first international flight so ive never seen that done before on my flight from osaka to tokyo the seats were way more comfortable there were no individual tvs on the seats though the man seated in the row ahead of me asked if it was ok for him to extend his seat which i thought was extremely courteous there was plenty of legroom and i could extend my legs without accidentally kicking the feet of the person sitting in front of me i loved everything about jal except for the small and cramped seats on my hour flight from los angeles to osaka,3
nothing went right on our return trip from japan japan air allowed my year old daughter to bring a tripod on the plan to present at a summit in japan with no problem during our trip back not only would they not allow her to bring it on the plane not one representative of the airline understood english and we almost missed our flight because of this i repeatedly told them we were happy to leave the tripod and they could dispose it as they saw fit but they then told me i could not get on the plane unless i picked up the tripod from security either way they were not allowing me to get on the plane they separated my daughter and me and made me run through the airport not once but twice insisting i was going to miss my flight if i didnt run at full speed with my carry on luggage in tow after running for minutes straight i get to the gate to be informed there is an hour delay no one could have told the airline representative that as she was insisting i run at full speed back and forth through the airport,1
was very pleasantly surprised when we stepped into the aircraft a boeing first up it was maybe half business class and the other half economy with a small premium economy section secondly the economy configuration which was of the configuration was great it meant more width in the seat also this flight has the biggest legroom i have ever seen was just on an emirates boeing a couple of weeks before this flight and although quite good emirates does this jal was heaps better food was good too with great service do try their sky time kiwi juice its kinda weird but nice in a good way only thing i had a slight issue with is temperature usually when flying there are aircon vents above you which you can adjust on this flight though there werent any which made the aircraft a little on the warm side for me me and my dad were using the safety information card to fan ourselves during decent as it got warmer maybe flying a night flight might mitigate this,4
japan airline best airline from the rest of airline i had travelled to seoul via japan narita airport and return same the service was fully excellent i would suggest if you flying to canada seoul some part of usa must go with it,5
i love flying japan airlines service is excellent very polite and helpful seat arrangement was good didnt seem cramped personal enter monitor snacks mid flight they even arranged delivery if my cell phone when i list it at narita airport,5
i was dreading this flight after a cramped jal experience years ago but i was pleasantly surprised the leg room was comfortable the flight staff were very accommodating and the special meal request was quite edible my only complaint would be the aircon the cabin was very warm and there was no personal air vent the in flight entertainment wasnt huge but sufficient connecting flight to osaka actually left from haneda airport not narita so read the fine print in the itinerary and leave plenty of connecting time for a long bus trip,4
the very first time i flew with japan airlines jl was since then i have travelled many times with this carrier on several different sectors over the years i have found jl to be consistent in their service delivery from the moment you enter check in to completion of your flight you are dealing with smiling and service minded personnel and crew within reason nothing seem too much for jls staff and crew to ensure your experience is the best possible before i continue i just like to point out that over the last years i have travelled with more airlines than i care to remember some strand out as very good few come up to a standard similar to that of jl i have travelled in all classes with jl irrespective of class of travel their service level is high food even in economy class is of high standard i once travelled jl sector tokyo helsinki with a friend of mine we had just being served our first meal accompanied by a small bottle of sake at our request my friend said if this is what we are eating in economy class what on earth are they enjoying in business class i always find the cabin spotless the same goes for the toilettes the crew are constantly cleaning lavatories throughout the duration of the flight making sure everything is a only negative the inflight announcements are hard to hear and understand this due to low volume and sometimes poor english pronunciation the later depending on the crew member of cause i would like to see jl introducing english prerecorded inflight announcements i am fully aware that sometimes the operating crew has to make announcements in the cabin for various reasons summary of the above i mainly had economy class in mind here as majority of passengers travel in economy class jls premium economy is of very good standard entering business and first class we are talking excelent legroom is ample im cm i am very comfortable when in economy class including onboard their dreamliner seat comfort i feel is good no complains there catering as mentioned above of high standard the amount of food is just right snacks are available throughout the flight drinks are complementary on jl however the crew rightfully so reserves the right to refuse serving alcoholic beverage to any passenger who may be intoxicated as far as fares are concerned jl are matching other airlines there is not a great deal of fare difference from any other carrier as far as i have found i can highly recommend japan airlines if you are in japan flying jl try to see if you can obtain a special stop over package through jl,5
i traveled to the philippines to pick up my fiancé and her son i was impressed with the fantastic food service and service overall they were very kind and gave my future son a choice of coloring book or model airplane to play with the seats were set wider apart and were very comfortable i will fly with this airline again,5
this was my first time traveling with jal gotta say that i love space on the airplane and in flight entertainments the service of cabin crews were smooth and nice however the only problem i had was the communication with jal ground staff they couldnt communicate in english which made the connections i had slower than expected but overall i will travel with this airline again but next time i will try to book a flight without any connecting flights,4
always a pleasure to fly jal entertainment is a little lacking by asian standards so on a hour daytime flight can get a little sparse super fast and affordable inflight internet on my flight love to fly on their s,5
this was my first time on jal the flight from jfk is long hrs so comfort and service are key i had originally booked economy seating but found out that you can upgrade to premium economy at the airport for dollars so decided to do that the extra room was worth it but the seat was a bit strange you could not actually recline the seat instead it slid forward which i did not care for i stayed in economy on the way back but found the seat a bit hard so put a few blankets down and was fine the service is wonderful and food acceptable the in flight entertainment was just okthe movies did not change from one month to the next all in all a good experience,4
checkin at the singapore airport was fast and smooth except that there is no bagdrop counter for people who do online checkin which defeats the whole purpose of doing online checkin however the checkin process at the osaka itami airport was terribly slow once again there is no separate queue for those who have done online checkin jal just added on an extra cm to the legroom and yes it means a lot the seats are much more spacious even though you are in economy meals on board are of good quality and i would say this is the most tasty airline meal i have ever tried drinks service are regular and the cabin crew are very friendly however i have only complain the cabin temperature is very warm,5
always a pleasure and a pleasant time attentive as always efficient wat more can ask for typical japanese efficiency also fly with them for all my international routes closing in on a million miles with them if they can come back with some services and awards to their most frequent fliers which were taken away with their bailouts would be a huge,5
i have now flown with jal over twenty times and rate them so highly i have to tell as many as possible firstly i get access to the business lounge on a premium economy ticket less than half price but can still upgrade to business for a few hundred dollars if there are spare seats when i check in they have never been delayed the plane is always a boeing you never get a really fat guy seating next to you sumo fly first class the service is excellent the toilets are always clean the food is great and the japanese beer is better i can not recommend them highly enough,5
jal is simply great airlines with very nice and comfortable planes and great cabin leg room is very nice and seats are very much comfortable food quality is very nice lovely and cabin crew overall great service,5
my st experience flying with jal to narita airport tokyo was satisfactory and enjoyable great service with friendly stewardesses though we had language barrier however the airconditioned on board was quite warm that night economy seat but comfortable,4
great service by all the attendants on the plane they were the most hospitable attendants i have ever flown with i wish i would have been in business class for this leg of my trip hours to bangkok but i was at the bulkhead and had some stretch roomoverall a good experience,4
after being told several years ago by friends about their positive experience with jal flying from sydney to london my wife and i decided to fly jal on our recent february trip to france and italy we decided to fly premium economy as on a cost basis it was certainly cheaper than going via the uae plus it also included overnight accommodation at narita airport before the on flight to paris we flew the entire outward bound sector on a boeing jals aircraft are modern clean reasonably quiet comfortable and bright the seating in premium economy is first rate there is plenty of leg room and the seats have generous width a big big plus is that the seat in front does not recline into your personal space and likewise neither does your seat encroach on your fellow passenger you are also supplied with sony noise cancelling headphones and a great selection of movies and to make the trip even more comfortable slippers and a blankets the presentation of all these extra as one expects from japan was impressive another feature about jal premium economy which we did not realise when booking is that jal give you access to their business class lounge as part of the fare on our return leg to australia and without going into great detail as a result of the impact of the terrorists attack in paris in late we were changed to a qantas premium economy flight not out of narita but out of haneda we thought that this would be an equally wonderful experience needless to stay what a disgrace old extremely noisey uncomfortable cramped i cannot describe how disgusted we both were with the qantas experience when the passenger in front reclined their seat the only way out to the single toilet also shared with business class was to do a chubby checker twist to get out of the row the so called crappy noise cancelling headphone were served up in a reused plastic bag making me think that the headphones from the previous user had just had the cord rewound and shoved back into a plastic bag i did even want to put them on the food so so ordinary we didnt eat it also with qantas you dont have access to the business class lounge when we fly again it will definitely be with jal a great airline,5
timely courteous efficient great service they were always checking to make sure i was comfortable and that everything was fine no complaints from me other than i could have used a bit more leg room everything else i was fully satisfied even the food was delicious sukiyaki type meat over rice fresh salad fruits that were sweet noodles ice cream and a drink i would definitely recommend jal also took the flight jl from shanghai pudong to haneda japan another great flight,5
our first time fling jal and we were most impressed from early checkin to completion of our journey whilst their grasp of english was limited the air hostesses were able to provide an in flight service second to none the planes were spotless although on one flight leg the plane was rather noisy which required ear plugs to sleep the inflight entertainment could also do with some improvement overall however a very good experience,4
in the last four years japan airlines has improve their airline considerably modern aircrafts with probably the best economy seats that you will find in an airline really good service at the airport and much better on board easy boarding and an excellent average of punctuality makes japan airlines one of the best options to travel today by plane good choice,4
we traveled in september for tourism purpose with this company repeatedly to make connections between okinawa and small islands miyako ishigaki yonaguni it was a difficult period because of the typhoons but we were warned every time at time and when canceled we had no worries for repayment at the service level everything was impeccable i even ordered indian vegetarian on board and really for the first time it has been a pleasure to eat in flight a really nice compagny,5
japan airlines is definitely one of the best for your flights to japan ive been using jal for my japan vacations since and i have not looked at another carrier since i currently use your jfk to narita flight jl and jl on return and will be using it again in two more weeks on october th in the morning the flight attendants are welcoming very friendly respectful and definitely make sure those long hours on the plane will be as comfortable as possible from checkin to getting on the plane was the most simple procedure checking in online is recommended but even if you do it at the airport its not a big deal both are fairly simple processes on the plane you have a large variety of movies music games and maps to keep you occupied they have multiple languages so again its not usually a problem you can also read manga and watch anime both of which i enjoy the planes are always in top shape very clean and ready for the next customers to come aboard the flight attendants also speak good english and there is plenty of leg room even in the economy seats overall its a very comfortable flight economy provides you with a very nice meal on the jfk to nrt route and then back to jfk last year they had beef bowls from yoshinoya on the route back to jfk that was great overall i love japan airlines for my flights to japan and will continue using them as long as i go to japan out of stars for me a very happy customer with jal thank you for all you do to keep the flight comfortable and keep us happy keep up the good work over there at jal,5
nice to be on a brand new with its comfort and features great overall service including food and entertainment the crew was exceptional buzzing around calmly and efficiently taking care of everyone impressive for economy class,5
jal sydnrt uses the qantas business class lounge so im not commenting on that the b was good and every seat had direct isle access even with the layout they have the sky suite mk ii and it was like a cocoon style suite i tried the japanese dishes and was delicious the lounge at narita was busy but roomy they have an upstairs dining room which is well catered for and serves modern and traditional meals as per usual they have ample seating free wifi and food and beverages they have an automated beer serving machine a must to see it in action the flight from nrtcdg was with a b every seat has direct isle access layout and has the mk ii sky suite installed however it has marked improvements to it then on their b the suite is more digitalised and automated the meals were again outstanding i had the japanese meals again i also ordered the snack food from the seat pda and it was delivered promptly the aircraft and crew were faultless the check in at both locations overnight stay in tokyo was seamless i checked my bags all the way through so i avoided waiting for them in nrt the japanese staff at nrt didnt speak english to well but we managed to communicate pretty well cant wait for my return journey,5
overall very good polite check in service minus one jerk polite flight attendants and a clean airplane but a bit expensive,4
a very friendly flight attendant abroad made or flight much comfortably they come handy and always tried to give the best service they can for us,5
from check in to baggage pick up everything went smoothly staff very friendly and helpful seats comfortable great movies and other channels to choose from food was really tasty too,5
jal was best airline i have flown to beijing and the airport experience in china was so much better than some of the chinese carriers who had one single line for all check in do leave time for security and immigration though it can be slow,4
we were very happy with this flight as the premium economy seats were really spacious particularly important for my tall husband they were capsules and thus one was never bothered by the person in front moving their seat back there were lots of spaces for storage too the flight attendants were there when needed drinks were available throughout and the food was fine we were also pleased that we could use the qantas lounge while waiting for the flight,5
solid performance attentive service mostly japanese clientele which to whom they properly cater correspondingly their selection of movies is quite limited almost no european movies and not many korean indian or chinese ontime performance and easy one terminal hasslefree transfer in narita,4
this is a long haul over hours of constant flying we actually started with a connecting flight from hong kong also on jal so the total flying time was close to hours checkin was smooth and our bags were transferred without problems there were plenty of food and beverage options both japanese and western the quality of the fixed menus and the alacarte choices was excellent the number of flight attendants was sufficient to provide efficient and friendly service the aircraft from narita to boston was a with comfortable seats in the upright relaxed and bed positions entertainment choices were plentiful and the electronics were in good working order i bought an expensive fullfare business ticket for myself and combined it with a lowcost companion ticket for my wife though one of our creditcard programs which made the cost for two competitive with other business fare options on other airlines i highly recommend jal for flights from the us east coast to east asia,5
after awful transocean trips on american airlines and british air traveling on jal was reminded me of what flying once was until the airlines decided they could make more money by packing customers tight enough to provoke some poor souls to airrage on jal the seats were wide enough and the leg room ample enough so that we didnt feel cramped even the bathrooms were large highly recommended for anyone with mobility issues there were enough bathrooms too the food was excellent our breakfast a rice bowl with condiments came with a card identifying the food and instructions on how to enjoy it i ate every bit if i have a choice i will always choose jal for transocean flights,5
flights were pretty much on time and it made so much more sense to board from back to front after the first classelderlychildren were boarded because it made getting on the plane and checking your carryon luggage in the bins that much more efficient and fast stewardess were all very friendly polite and professional would definitely fly jal again in the future,5
spacious ergonomical seats which are quite roomy and comfortable the back is shaped in such a way that it moulds to your back and you dont have to put it on recline to be comfy generous amenities full water bottle to last you throughout the flight in flight comfort kit and of course fun kid packs for the little ones shows how thoughtful they are in trying to make your flight as comfortable as possible easily my favorite airline and my year old daughters too yes she always bencmark other airlines to japan airlines due to excellent experience she had on board,5
having flown premium economy with another carrier this year we decided to upgrade for this flight also it is very much worth paying the extra on a long haul flight and jal were worth the upgrade but i have to say that the other carrier we used this year was slightly betternot much the seat comfort and inflight entertainment were better although they did not have wifi as jal did all in all jal was a comfortable flight and the cabin crew were very attentive and everything was kept absolutely spotless would have no hesitation in recommending jal at all please see my other reviews on airlines,5
the extra money is worth it with more space and better amenities for long haul trips i would heartily recommend it my husband is a little overweight lbs so long flying times in cramped seats dont appeal to him premium economy let him recline comfortably with a footrest so he actually slept which he normally cant do on airplanes we did china awhile ago so i know additionally with bose noise cancelling headphones to watch movies and great meals and snacks we were stuffed getting off the plane both going to and returning from tokyo these were very pleasant overseas flights and the attendants were all so attentive and friendly it made the trip all the better,5
good old aircraft that has great layout in economy typical domestic service with soft drinks only and attentive staff punctual i have one world sapphire card so enjoying the perk like a airline lounge and priority check in and boarding are an advantage,4
they actually hold a banner from the side of the runway and wave you off with a banner that says see you again soon besides this they are attentive to your needs especially with the call button they answer all your immigration questions they serve with a smile and not like someone who hates their job,5
not a good organised airline in sydney but that was the best part approaching tokyo the plane was diverted to the other side of japan because of a storm over tokyo having been delayed for hours i missed my connection to new york when we arrived back in tokyo their booking office was closed and we spent the night on the floor with no blankets food or water no one came to apologize and we had to make our own arrangements for onward travel this caused missing a day that was already paid for in new york i wont recommend this airline to anyone,2
have to wait more than hours before we can check in just because of the taifun have to rush for boarding after check in i agree with safety first policy and do not mind the wait luckily the airport facility in the area before check in is quite good so we are not too uncomfortable because no waiting lounge in this area flight was good service were perfect from my experience japan airline stewardesses are well informed and always make note about arrival time number of passengers etc the business class seats are a bit narrow and i wish the cabin temperature can be lowered to about degrees c so we can enjoy sleeping under the blanket not sweating when standing at the galleys area the temperature is nice and cool but the cabin is too warm for me the availability of toilet showers are one of the best comfort look forward to fly again on jal the food is always good and by making a transit stay for one or more nights in japan we will not suffer from jet lag when travelling from and to the us by allowing no extra charge for transit in japan one or two nights following the transit visa shore pass regulation i am sure more traveler will take jal when travelling to the us and it will be good for tourism in chiba and japan,4
always impressed with jal the service is just solid i wouldnt go far as to say friendly but it is efficient and quality the seats in premium economy were good certainly on par with the offerings from cathay and qantas and better than american or ba the flight might take longer but its great way to get to nyc watch out for passport control in nyc hour line up i want be so upset about early morning arrival in la again at least its only ever taken mins there,4
we flew the sydneynarita and naritafrankfurt legs and return with jal the canberrasydneycanberra legs were with qantaslink the jal ticket was by far the cheapest business class ticket other than koreanair and the chinese airlines that require a long layover in a chinese airport and included hotel overnights in sydney and narita on the outward journey the jal route to europe has two advantages over other australiaeurope routes it divides the flight into more even legs the total time is not longer than with say singapore airlines because it flies almost over the north pole it avoids war zones the service on board was excellent and there is a choice of japanese or european menus the only small downside is that even with the mattress provided the beds are a bit hard,4
very good service very comfortable seats good room leg the inflight entertainment offered good choice of movies and entertainment there is also moslem food choice for muslim travel we enjoyed our hours journey from changi to haneda tq jal,5
jal is an example of japanese service friendliness and efficiency i had upgraded to pe for a reasonable price and the seat and extra space were worth the cost meals are the same as in economy with some added extras like champagne and noodle cups staff very courteous and with a quick response to a call meals were tasty and unlike other companies there was no western option regular drink and snack rounds the entertainment programme offered enough variation to keep one from getting bored regular information announcements from the staff and pilots,5
if you like japanese mangascomics and plan to go to japan take japan airlines many manga are available for you to read for the or hours spent in the airplane you wont get bored at all also their food was great i had udon noodles and rice with salmon instead of the chicken or beef dishes served in other airlines on the way to japan on the return trip i had the yoshinoya beef bowl and hagendaz icecream i enjoyed flying round trip to japan for the first time,5
jal were wonderful to fly with we had our four children with us and they were very attentive to ensure that they were comfortable and happy the meals were lovely and larger than other airline meals the entertainment system was very up to date and modern the plane itself was roomy and economy did not feel squashy at all we would definitely fly jal again in the future,5
i dont normally leave reviews for airlines flights are normally pretty similar maybe slightly better food or facilities but you pretty much know what youre getting however jal surpassed any airline ive ever flown on and the customer service and food was outstanding we flew economy but this was even better than any premium economy either the staff went out of their way for you without you asking for it jesus who was in the back cabin of ba on th september noticed i was hot when i was getting on the plane and came with cold water and sorted out the air con he was lovely to chat to and offered to bring my dinner later and heat it up as i was asleep when it was brought round im not a great traveller despite flying several times a year so he made the experience much more pleasant the food was such a delight such good quality and i actually ate it all which i dont normally do on a flight it felt like flying was back in the s great service great food with some thought put into it and the experience made you feel a bit special,5
jal offers the best economy class product across the pacific hands down with inches if seat pitch and wide seats the ride is very comfortable crew is truly professional and extremely courteous and polite meals are good and flights almost always on time in my opinion services to san francisco are from haneda airport which is very convenient to all points in central tokyo highly recommended,5
ouch it all began with the officious crew in western uniform i remember jal staff in traditional dress giving us a taste of their country as soon as you step on board seats are narrow and hard and at cms i could not stretch out completely in a flat bed food so so,3
i had a flight to tokyo from cgk and i had a good time during the flight i remember the cabin crew gave us a disposable towel for cleaning the face the leg room is long enough the seat is comfortable the entertainment is good as well one thing that i dislike is the food i didnt like the raw dish that they served to me tasted awful to me but with the good service i would say that my experience was fair enough,4
this is a little gem and a nice experience although this is only my second first class flight i think im happy to declare its probably not worth the extra dollarspoints up from business class maybe singapore suites may change this opinion you get into the qantas first class lounge in sydney where the neil perry dining means there isnt much point eating on the plane too much when you are on the plane the service is terrific as expected and the pours of alcohol generous the japanese appreciate someone who can handle their scotch and are respectful and nonjudgmental the hibiki yr old and chivas royal salute went down very well they are obviously proud of their menu which is very good the wifi didnt work that well but why be on the phone when on a flight like this on the return the jal sakura lounge is good too with a sushi bar and sake bar its the best thing about the otherwise uninspiring and long way out narita airport,5
whilst jal had most of the perks that usually come with business class its seats and your personal space could do with a a little face lift seats go into full bed mode i even had a mattress in my overhead cabin to make my flight more comfy remote control was within reach without any effort to control my seat which had a very gentle massager did nothing for me really and my tvhello my husband got the window seat and i got the aisle so even though i couldnt get a proper view of outside at least i couldve slide my privacy window upautomatically so i can hide my jealously i had access to all the latest american movies and even japanese and indian films with caption i also had enough space to store all my knickknacks extra bags and books food was awesome i had course options japanese western and i cant remember the other i chose the japanese it had so many different items from prawn lotus root egg roll eel duck pufferfish and more some items in this course came in a tray looked like food samples but nevertheless was fulling the meal was the most interesting it was like a food feast in the air i even got to make my own origami my fight attendant offered to wake me up for breakfast a first ive encountered on a flight which i truly appreciated,4
we were dreading a long flight but it was so comfortable excellent food very good wine and the hostesses were attentive and beautiful we had such a good time with our friends when the plain landed we did not want to get off,5
as we have someone on wheelchair travelling with us we were assisted at every sector of the flights first we were told to check in early to get the needed seats near to the toilets we were able to sit together upon arrival at tokyo for the transfer to the domestic terminal there was a ground staff who assisted us accompany all the way for the transfer i m quite sure we wong make it without his help and company there was a free transfer n the re checking in of luggage etc and he was a great and comforting presence i m so pleased as it was excellent service i have no hesitation flying jal on the future by the way the seats and keg room on both planes were much spacious compared to many other airlines o have flew in kudos to jal,5
the service on the narita to honolulu flight is different to other jal services such as to europe and usa where there is more competitionthe food selection was very limited and the food good but not to the standard you might see on other flights there was no amenities packthe staff however compensate and are always very good and pleasant the aircraft was an older and not to other business class standards,3
we flew from los angeles to hong kong with a hour stopover at narita in tokyo on september la to japan via boeing and japan to hong kong via both new planes were very comfortable i especially like the touch screen monitors and bathrooms the cabin services were excellent throughout the trip the pilot landed the in foul weather at narita very smoothly however i was disappointed with the food served this entire trip i had expected better tasting food from jal it may be just me but i found the packaging of meals especially annoying and difficult for someone with arthritic fingers i did like the miso soup served hot from a pitcher my mochi ice cream was frozen passengers with connecting flights had to go through another security check because narita had only one machine operating there was a long queue the bottleneck made us nervous about missing out flight turned out our flight was delayed by half an hour before takeoff anyway,4
very efficient and friendly checkin premium economy seats have plenty of leg room when the person in front reclines the back of their seat does not move so you always have plenty of space this is the type of seat you got in business class a few years ago food was excellent onboard service was excellent well worth the extra money above economy fare this is the best premium economy flight i have ever taken,5
as platinum frequent aa flyer i can tell you that from the checkin until luggage claim everything was perfectly organized and well orchestrated amazing good food and service hostesses very helpful and polite a very but very good experience western airlines can still learn from them,5
a very nice trip with jal on our first trip with them great service and some very nice japanese food to sample overall an enjoyable trip,4
everything worked perfectly from checkin to baggage claim the seats were pretty comfortable and little bigger than usual so there was atleast few cms more space to spend the hr flight in flight attendants were all nice and really polite and always willing to help also there were lots of movies and series to watch from your own screen food was also pretty good and the flight landed in narita a few minutes earlier than expected the must useful thing is that the price includes xkg of checked baggage you can take with you since nowadays some companies charge extra even for one kg luggage so im definitely using jal when im going to japan next timw,5
first leg is codeshare flight with qantas to aussie which was cancelled jal came to the party and booked us on another airline whch got us to tokyo earlier than our scheduled flight full marks for fixing what could have been a very sad day and whne finally on an actual jal flight service very good,5
i have flown many airlines but jal is by far the classiest i cant really put it into words but there is absolutely no question that i have felt appreciated as a customer while flying jal ive made the trip between tokyo and manila maybe times now and have yet to be disappointed it doesnt hurt that a nice cold can of beer is free just as the typical sodas i have taken advantage fo this a time or two especially since this hour flight is usually immediately following my hour chicago to tokyo flight anything to take the edge off is fine by me,5
jal has recently upgraded many of its planes to the they are roomy relatively and comfortable compared to previous jal airplanes and much better than any usbased airline meals are good for airplane food and service is very good talk to the staff if you have any questions or comments japanese people are not likely to upgrade anyone for trivial reasons but they will do their best to accommodate any requests,5
ive flown tokyohonolulu tokyoparis tokyolondon tokyola tokyobangkok and ive never been disappointed their premium economy is my choice if cant be on business class plenty of leg room the reclining seats are amazing and the meals are actually good they usually have jal brand cup noodles if youre not up for a whole meal or still hungry and their selection of wines etc are quite nice and plenty of newspapers and magazines too if youre flying from nrt must try the japanese style beef curry served in the jal lounge,5
our hour flight was on a newer plane the legroom was tight in economy but the seat were comfortable with adequate cushioning the lavatories were spacious and clean they even had toothbrushes in the lavatory the flight attendants served meals on the flight neither was really tasty but at least it was something to eat there was a box of snacks available between meals the flight attendants were polite and gracious as you would expect of the japanese check in security customs and boarding were a breeze at the osaka airport,5
we contacted jal directly as we needed a bassinet for our son so were able to select our seats at the time of booking once on board the legroom and seating was good for an economy seat the service for infants is also good with staff providing meals hot water and also washing bottles the food and drink service for adults is also better than some airlines of a similar grade jal has improved considerably in recent years,4
i love japan airlines this is my first choice i been flying with them for many yrs i traveled to japan i like how they treated me they give excellent customer service everyone from the checkin to the stewardess are so friendly i never had any problems the staff are so professional too they deliver service with a smile all the time i know most people who choose airlines would usually go for the cheapest price first but not me i always look for how well the staff treats the customer i really do not mind paying the price to ride this airlineto me it is well worth it i would give this airline a star i also would recommend japan airlines to everyone out there the food is also so good so when i exit the planei always bow to the staff because i appreciate them japan airlines is the safest to ride in my opinion,5
we decided to travel with jal due to the advertised extra cm leg rooms it did not disappoint us however the seat design is quite strange and i had to put pillows to support my lower back the check in in the airport is smooth although the flight is full we have no problem storing our hand carry in the overhead compartment unlike some other airlines it may be lucky that you find room to store your hand carry as other passengers seem to have so many hand carry luggage and the airline is not stopping them the jal air hostesses are very polite and attentive the meals are decent and jal is generous with their drinks and you can help yourselves to snacks during the flight,4
i love japanese cuisine and i would always fly with any airline that serves japanese food of course japan airlines being japans national carrier would make a tremendous job in serving the best japanese airline food onboard i also find their flight crew one of the most courteous crew among all airlines there is something different on how japanese talk and give service they speak almost in whispers and they move very gracefully the flight crew were all japanese except there was one time we flew to bangkok also using jal and our flight crew were of different nationalities and they stayed in the same hotel we stayed in we got to talk to some of them and the japan airline crew was being trained in bangkok i guess the training of jal flight crew is very different and its very exceptional i dont mind flying with jal again the seats are ok food is good and crew is exceptional,4
normally wed pull an economy flight but there were none left i must admit it was great having extra legroom and comfy recliner seats also you get a little qantas lounge at the start the best bit is that the seats dont move back when you recline so noone gets in your face and you dont piss anyone off ever my first meal was excellent but my partner says never choose the fish the staff are superb really good staff one of the gentlest landings ever there were some slight delays sydney airports fault and you could tell they really cared about not being on schedule they made up the time on the way and we arrived bang on if you are flush with funds go for it for the space but if moneys too tight to mention their economy is pretty good too,3
lovely experience but then i had never really experienced going to japan before their meals are a lot of fun if you like japanese style otherwise play it safe and request your meal before the flight,5
night flight meal are excellent as food was from japan catering furthermore with hagen daz icecream as dessert cheese bread as late snack i requested for hot water and it was served real hot so pleased service,5
i and my family are the big fan of jal due to many reasons that you could get best services bestnew aircraft good food however the ticket price is quit high compared with those of others,5
japan airline is one of the best airlines ive flown with everything from the time you checkin till the time you leave the airport at your destination is excellent all the staff are extremely helpful delightful and extremely approachable the seating on the plane as well as the meal was fantastic,5
excellent flight on one of jals dreamliners crew was so graceful it was a pleasure loved the japanese whiskey they gave out helped me sleep through hours of travel time i did like anas seating more comfortable though but their plane was better,5
it was great first impression lasts experience for us to try a different airline to far east the service food inflight entertainment is excellent comfortable flight free layover hotel too,5
jal are the best from the moment i checkedin to the time in the diamond lounge to the boarding and the flight i was impressed but then that is what i take for granted as i have flown with jal many times and know that i am always in the best hands all the staff treat me like a king and spoil me rotten i love to have a casual joke with them and they are always very pleasing to talk to i wont fly with any other airline in japan as i believe that jal is number,5
my st time to fly japan airlines happened because our original departure flight from beijing back to the usa got cancelled and we were rerouted from pek to tokyo and then the us the experience was very good with a very friendly staff that spoke very well in english the food service was great and the in seat entertainment options were friendly towards an english speaking customer if another opportunity happens would consider flying japan airlines again,4
dont get the bulkhead seat in economy there is no seat pocket to store things in and the tv is small and cannot be used until after takeoff crew were busy and took min before we could figure out how to select the english instructions on the tv food was ok comfy flight angle flat seats so it would be awful to sleep on but good for daytime flight,3
what an excellent service jal provides the seats are the best i have sat in in either economy or indeed business class leather and full on soft staff totally attentive without being over the top and check in was seamless without barely a word of english,5
this was one of the best long haul travel experiences ive ever had the customer service was incredible the efficiency was unbeatable the award winning seats menu and service made my trip unforgettable,5
jal was the best airline i have flown in years i loved the dreamliner a quiet and spacious aircraft i very much appreciated the roomy seats jal gave even in economy the service was attentive and friendly and the crew was very considerate of the time passengers needed to sleep i dont know how economy class can get any better than this,5
the good thing about jal is that you know what you will get never excellent never bad just the same regular service the airplanes seem to be a bit nicer lately service is always helpful and the lounges are consistent,3
this is my first time trying japan airlines and i never experienced such service from the other airlines before everything in the plane is just so comfortable that you would want to extend the hours of your flight all the crews were so friendly as well,5
fantastic in every way i had traveled on jal several years ago and the experience was ok wow have things changed now excellent service on time arrival and the food was a step above typical airline cuisine i highly recommend jal,5
the food was great and the flight attendants were very nice the aircraft was very clean would definitely like to travel jal again,5
your experience on a flight is always defined by the class of service in this case premium economy but it felt almost as good as business class the seats are wider and have more dedicated legroom than any other prem economy ive flown the in flight service was excellent and the staff pretty good too if im flying jal again id find it hard to justify the extra expense for business unlike other airlines,5
seat and legs room were wider than most of the big airline adult food was average but the kid meal was amazing entertainment system was average in comparison but enough to kill time during the hrs of flight all kid will get to choose a toy gift once they on board and keep them accompanied while waiting for boarding the domestic connection the captain actually reach out every kid and say hi and give them stickers this kind of service which i used to see years ago but hardly see these days jal really give you a feeling of being a customer rather than a passenger jal was my first flight years ago and after years later they did let me down strongly recommended if you are travelling with young kids,4
on the long haul flight the choice of food and drinks was very big local and international entertainment was good with a big choice,4
standard services from the crews the foods need to have some improvements i expect higher from the aircraft but it looks like budget airline,4
comfortable relax very good service an excellent opportunity to take some photos of fuji mountain feel lucky,5
i always have excellent flight experiences flying with jal and this was no exception the flight stewards are willing to share a laugh with you and are always willing to help from the checkin to the lounge to the boarding to the flight i know im in good hands with jal,5
i love jal they are one of my favourite airlines service and comfort is their speciality nothing is too difficult for jal the ladies on the flight are always prepared to engage with the traveller giving you that warm friendly feeling,5
i flew jal because an open jaw ticket from tokyo to kl and from singapore to tokyo was available only on jal the air fare was quite reasonable for flying in a busy summer season the seats on the outbound flight b were spacious for the economy class but the seat cover was a bit slippery and not comfortable the seats on the inbound flight b were quite tight it was an overnight flight and i couldnt sleep very well the meals were mediocre at the most jal used to provide top notch inflight services but i didnt feel that way this time at all the general attitudes of the cabin crew were just okay which may reflect some inadequacy of their current job training it just wasnt like that before,3
i flew this route early august and jal has started using new s on the route its a two class version business and coach the business cabin has lie flat seats in a configuration on the way to taipei i had the japanese meal and it was actually good on the way back i had the western meal and it was passable service was standard jal which has improved over the years,4
no earplugs and slippers provided on the plane flight meals also not good as before feel disappointed,3
i try to fly jal whenever i fly to japan be it for business or for vacation living in taiwan and working in asia means i am in the air a lot the flight is almost always on time if not early the cabin crew are very well trained and offer very good service regardless of seating class be it economy or business class you are treated with great service and respect i will definately fly japan airlines within asia as much as possible,5
i live in japan so i traveled with jal a lot of times to a lot of places and i always have mixed feelings about it the price of the ticket was not too expensive but jal usually is they are a very prestigious airline famed for always being on time and their very high standards i agree just like pretty much everything in japan they live up to their standards specially in safety and service however on this particular flight i was not happy at all the flight going to bangkok the aircraft was much older and the way back had a very new very nice aircraft one good thing was there was more space even my very tall husband was happy that the leg space on economy class was bigger and on both the older and newer plane the entertainment system was much better on the newer airplane but the movie selection was very good and similar in both now the bad i never flew with jal that i actually liked their food this time was no exception it was a midnight flight and they did not serve dinner just a pastry that i couldnt figure what it tasted like and some nuts i didnt eat at the airport cause haneda does not have lots of options either so i was hungry until morning well morning breakfast wasnt great either on the flight back was the same thing a dinner but no choice at all usually every airline has a western choice this did not thou the food wasnt as terrible this time after flying hours there was nothing at breakfast only coffee well still they turn the lights on hours before landing so you basically cut on the very little extra sleep you could have had it seemed as they are trying to cut on costs also surprisingly the service was not the best some of the flight attendants did not speak english well it was a little hard to communicate and also a bit rude not likely to japan at all i was disappointed specially since my next flight was with bangkok airways and they won so much with me with service and super tasty food in a very short flight i could definitely tell the difference i was never a big fan o jal for long flights and besides de extra space im not sure i would choose them again,3
there is no direct flight from toronto to tokyo we need to take aa to dallas first and then connected the jal to tokyo onboard flight crew were attentive and met any requests with a smile and a bow we loved the space that we had even though we just in economy class so much more legroom and actual space the food was moderate but their service was good,4
although i had booked my flights on another company issues made me travel with jal instead and it was a very pleasent surprise to flight with this company excellent quality at every level nice staff very good selection of programs to watch good quality meal all this made this long journey to japan very enjoyable and the start of very good vacations i would absolutly flight with them again for another visit in japan,5
japan airlines is one of my favorite airlines with very friendly and smiling flight attendants the moment you are seated a hot towel japanese snacks and drink will be served every seat has direct access to the aisle even the seat configuration is all window seats have a direct access without having to pass over your next neighbors legs whenever you want to get out even most of the flight attendants are japanese but their knowledge in the english language is totally sufficient to answer passengers question and request seats are very comfortable although not very wide but they are fully flat which is very important for a long haul flight meal is served two hours after take off and everyone can request light meals anytime during the flight and hours before landing meals are created by renowned culinary chefs in japan i always ordered japanese meals but western ones look appetizing as well i once had lamb chop on the flight from nrt to lax and it was surprisingly good movies on board have many choices including the newest released screen is very good size sakura lounge at narita airport for business class is very decent you just can go to the one nearest to your boarding gate if someone is fortunate enough to get into the first class lounge made to order sushi may be the best choice at the sakura lounge you can also have rice noodles hot soupbesides all kinds of beverages the airport and lounges are sparkling clean one more hint is that reservation should be made as soon as possible if you plan to travel during the peak seasons which are usually spring and autumn,5
what was a lovely trip to japan sapporo tokyo was spoilt at the final leg of the trip from tokyo to singapore the checking in was a long process there were of us with singapore passports and with malaysian passports all prs my son had a tube with a fishing rod to check in after issuing the boarding passes came the surprises first they asked for proof of residence in singapore for the my passport holders of us carried our sg ics with us and had no issue my daughter just had her sg driving licence to them that was not good enough and we had to wait for a good mins while they checked they came back with the most ridiculous reason from their counterpart in singaporesometimes the immigration in sg stops people who cannot provide residence status if only they checked the ica site they would have realised no visa is required if that is what they were after we settled that by signing an indemnity of some sort a cya for their comfort then came the next surprisethe tube with the fishing rod exceeds dimensions cm instead of max cm and my son had to pay s to get it loaded never had he ever experienced such an instance even on budget airlines where he carted his fishing tube eg tiger scoot and air asia so people with fishing gear esp tubes be careful and opt for other airlines for prs just carry your sg ic with you jal behaved worst than a low cost airline and this is the first and last time we fly jal,1
if you ever have enough money or points to fly first class then i highly recommend japan airlines only first class seats on my flight with wonderful ladies to attend to us it was an experience second to none i chose the japanese menu over the western menu and the food kept coming in small portions the entire flight it was wonderful the seat went to a fully flat huge bed much bigger than that of british airways,5
flying on jal was a very great step up from flying on american to tokyo the plane was much newer or at least refurbished there seemed to be a little more legroom and the seats were comfortable the entertainment system was definitely an upgrade from the american flight the food was quite nice and there was plenty to eat we got two meals on this hour flight beverage service was pretty normal and you could get alcohol if you paid for it the flight attendants were helpful and courteous jal is now an alaska airlines partner so there is one more reason to fly with them in the future i had left an item on the aircraft and it was difficult to get in touch with a jal representative at the jakarta airport never did get the item back but that was not their fault,4
first buying direct from jal website was only more per flight than expedia but you got to chose your seat and types of meal at time of booking on both the flight out and the return so i could book the same seats both ways i wont say which seats we had i dont wont everybody booking thembut seatguru listed them as bad they were the best seats weve ever had all economy seats have extra width and pitch compared with any other economy seat ive ever sat in usb socket power supply below seat and nifty drink holders cubbies and folding tables the films were up to date the food was very good and self service snacks and drinks were available throughout the flight the toilets were clean and were cleaned during the flight and a few toothbrushes were put out near the end of the flight the cabin crew were excellent and were so charming and attentive both the japenese crew and the englishirish crew would i fly jal again you bet i would,5
my first flight with jal was in the year i was impressed with the courtesy and efficiency of the crew ive flown many times since in a mixture of business and economy class whilst it may not be up to the standards of other airlines like emirates jal is in a class of its own and is now my preferred carrier depending on destination,5
japan airlines are great to travel with there is plenty of leg room the staff provide great and attentive service the food is ok by airline standards it was a pity that the entertainment server crashed making a hour daytime flight seem much longer the staff were apologetic in typically japanese style i intent to join the frequent flyer programme,4
this airline offers really the best value for money for the franrt connection at euros it is only a fraction of what the lufthansa flight would have costed service on board was extremely friendly and the food was very good having said that the service in nrt was not really great as many of the ground personnel were very complicated and took ages to check in nevertheless it is such a good deal i would always choose this airline over lufthansa to fly to nrt,4
他社同様に日本航空にはプレミアムエコノミーのサービスがあるが国内線でのコストパフォーマンスは極めて高い千円で得られるゆとりの空間空席ありの場合は是非利用したい as the other airline company jal also has the premium economy class which also is available for most other domestic line this class for domestic lines is absolutely affordable and i believe its worth to spend spacious comfortable and you may get early check in for upgraded customers you may not want to miss when its available,5
we normally fly this leg business class but were utilising points and first class only was available we tried the first class sakura lounge at narita airport which we didnt like as it was super dark and occupied by businessmen it felt unfriendly and we reverted to what we knew the sakura business lounge much more spacious with great views of the airport there are only first class suites on each aircraft in the configuration of if you like to sit together you are better to choose the middle two suites we decided to have window seats behind each other and the space is very good as is the lie flat bed the entertainment on offer isnt really extensive enough there were a few recent movies but generally the choice is poor the dinner was very similar to that offered in business class but the breakfast is more hard core japanese style not an egg in sight and we found the choice completely undesirable we just had coffee and fruit i would not travel or pay to go first class again the new business class seats all have aisle access and the breakfast choices are far better they provide everything a traveller would want privacy space decent seats a lie flat bed decent food choices and a reasonable price,4
i traveled with japan airlines once before but this time i traveled back with my husband from the check in our luggage until getting to the gate everything was good we loved the space that we had even though we just in economy class the food was moderate but their service was good i dont mind to travel again with japan airlines next time,4
checked out seat options of different airlines for this premium economy trip jal had easily the largest seat and leg space configuration the most amazing courteous check in procedure ive ever experienced in any class of business travel great entertainment system and food my new favourite airline,5
we use jal often due to their favorable business class prices and seating configuration which allows window seat passengers clear aisle access on jl there are now flat beds after takeoff at a drinks service is offered followed by lunch the timing of lunch is questionable as most passengers have just enjoyed breakfast in the qantas lounge in sydney there is no jal lounge japanese and western cuisines are offered the western choices always include fish beef and chicken but not a vegetarian option the presentation and level of service is excellent each meal is delivered individually not on a trolley however this all happens between and and im never ready for lunch at this time the entertainment is reasonable but latest movies are limited before landing at narita a snack is offered although a snack menu is available all day consisting of three types of japanese noodles and other offerings what sells this service to me is the timing of the service the reliability of the schedule and the graciousness of the service leaving first thing in the morning and arriving just after makes for a comfortable journey or stopover if youre travelling onwards id give it another star if they moved lunch back hours,4
the space for your legs is so spacious makes it very comfortable for a long haul flight thanks to the newly designed seats the food was tasty and wrapped nicely which made it interesting flight attendants were nice and they did speak english well,4
first flight ever on japan airlines jal it was a long flight but service from the crew members helped make the journey much more pleasant we received slippers to wear on the flight over to japan that was a nice surprise,5
jal is my preference of travel whilst im in japan you are treated like royalty from the moment you walk up to the checkin counter until the moment you disembark their warm friendly professional service is what brings me back to their airline every time you are kept well informed by the captain during your flight and nothing is too difficult for the flight stewards i was even asked if i needed the safety demonstration to be explained in english,5
when traveling for hours charlotte nc to mnl philippines ones level of patience as well as frustration does get thin it become more true when youre traveling with a year old grandson the last flight to mnl was with japan airlines so every minute counted with regards to keeping my sanity the flight attendants did their best to make this a comfortable flight for me and everyone else for some unusual reason i was severely parched throughout the trip i kept on asking for gallons of water and not once did i sense any level of impatience from any one of the flight attendants i say this because i actually experienced bad service on one of my other flights quite recently and this was even on a local flight food was even better in this airline when given a choice i would look with japan airlines for a connecting flight to get to my international destinations,5
from check in to departure at destination the staff could not have been more helpful good selection of western and japanese cuisine,4
this is the first time i flew with japan airlines and the layover from manilatokyochicago was overnight i did get to stay in a unique hotel in the airport but my flight wasnt exactly enjoyable i did not like the food that they served in the flight i do like japanese food but the one they served in both flights wasnt really a good one even the breakfast wasnt good enough compared to other airlines ive taken to make things worse i found out in tokyo airport that the airline charged me twice on my booking i found out when i was purchasing something that my card was declined and so i wondered why and my bank told me i had tickets from manilatokyochicagoatlanta charged to me as a result i had to pay the hotel cash and i couldnt use uber while in atlanta they have inconvenienced me big time so i dont think i will ever fly again with japan airlines the only saving grace they had was the coflight with american airlines the food was good and their service was better it took them more than a week to return my moneyand it was almost,3
i had not flown jal since i was a kid living in japan and so i was really small and space was never an issue many years later im a bigger guy with much longer legs so i was a little worried when i was flying from malaysia to japan i was very surprised at how spacious the economy section was with plenty of leg room the airline attendants were excellent which was not surprising very consistently attentive and courteous and genuinely pleasant i definitely will fly with them again in the future when i am in asia on connecting flights from tokyo to the us jal was partnered with american airlines and despite their limitations in assisting me with american airlines flight changes they were very apologetic and tried everything they could to assist me i found it so amusing that jal employees were more concerned about helping me than any of the american airlines employees for me it reinforces the belief that japanese companies truly put the customer first in theory and practice unlike many us companies i own the bias in this and i am open to continue being open to us companies proving me wrong,5
jal is one of the best airlines that i have had the experience of the level of service warm and friendly greetings comfort and cleanliness is why i always fly with jal whilst i am in japan they really know how to make you feel special,5
jal is an excellent airline great service comfortable and clean aircraft a real pleasure to fly with had not flown with jal in many years but their level of service is still up there,5
this is my favourite airline when travelling from manila to japan and vice versa i little bit expensive compared to the rest but you wont regret it always on time or even ahead of time very few delays experienced here crew and staff are friendly food is great check in is always a breeze,4
this was our first trip to japan the service food and luxury set the tone for our entire trip while it is a long flight everything about the airplane food and service when they saw my husband has some difficulty with his handicap they moved him so he would be more comfortable we couldnt believe the attendants changed clothes for food service and back for boarding and exiting we cant wait to go to tokyo again and we will used japanese airlines for sure,5
i used jal times mostly to travel to europe check in is usualiy easy and quick only once there was drama created as the check in personal aus woman at the sydney airport deemed photo on my passport with not much definition one hour of stress and running around the airport for finally being approved to get on the flight with a warning i might have problems elsewhere i did not passed through countries with no problem aus passport have electronic chip my passport was in its th year of usage and it had its wear and tear now i have a new passport tickets are good value for money japanese stile food nz wine is mostly amazing in business class staff is very polite re food i say mostly as on my last return flight from tokyo to sydney flight dinner served had too much of hot stuff in it it is funny that this happened on my way to europe i was giving compliments to the chefs food was simply divine seats and space in dreamliner are great i would not choose seat close to food prep area it is a bit noisy there are or lounges to choose at the narita airport one of them near gate is large on levels have showers space for smokers non smokers beds to sleep rest and more they prepare cooked food as well as snacks one of the best lounges if you have plenty of time between flights,4
i have a pleasant journey to arrive my destination the seat pocket looks clean the magazine is new and fun to read,5
we travelled to japan on japan airlines in january we are a family of five and we were all very happy with the service staff and flight the food was fine but the breakfast on the return flight was quite traditional and came with instructions and i wasnt really up to it at that late stage of the flight and wouldve preferred a more simple option on the other hand the airline handled my daughters peanut allergy extremely well and we were very happy with their care and her variety of food japan airlines seems to have more legroom than other airlines i have flown with which was great bathrooms were well maintained the flight attendants are so pleasant and helpful and really do make the flight a more enjoyable experience i would fly japan airlines whenever possible and highly recommend them,5
customer service cannot be faulted i did not check my bags through to my final destination correctly not jal fault jal ground staff sorted it all out with amazing efficiency before i had passed through customs in tokyo i had been reassured on separate occasions that my luggage had been sorted out the premium economy seats were comfortable with ample legroom the flight staff were efficient friendly and professional food top quality bathrooms always clean even after an hour flight airport lounges superb would recommend jal very highly will definitely fly with them again,5
very good inflight experience one of the best the meals are pretty good and the kids meals are so cute,5
i flew jal to manilla after arriving on american airlines at narita the seats were comfortable the staff and service were amazing the food was excellent and the inflight entertainment selections were top notch i have flown many airlines and this by far was my favorite,5
last december me and my family went on a trip to japan we flew with japan airlines as it was a redemption booking we simply loved the attention and care given by the cabjn crew to ensure our utmost comfort and pleasure we will surely fly with them again given the chance,5
my wife and i flew jal to japan for the first time recently flying originally from manchester to helsinki on a codeshare serviced by finnair the main helsinkinarita leg was on a flown by jal in their premium economy product the was quieter smoother and more comfortable than legacy aircraft and the actual route was much shorter than other european hubs instead of the usual hours it took just which was a huge help jal were professional courteous and the flight was superb highly recommended,5
this airline know how to provide first class service in economy amazing leg room compared to other international airlines staff are extremely polite and caring inflight service was excellent on our return flight we were upgraded to premium economy which felt like business class to me service was immaculate and the food excellent wish this airline flew everywhere come and teach our aussie airlines a thing or two,5
jal made it better after arriving at narita from sydney on a newly fitted out boing with much better business suite was disappointed on a number of counts transiting cost me my sealed booze even though staying flightside reloading to vancouver jal kept me waiting as their systems had not been adapted to accept details concerning the new electronic travel authorization eta that said canada customs were not ready for it yet either however standing and waiting in the heat at narita when as in business you things would move smoothly was a bummer then to get to a pretty dated business fit out in the capsule style seats was a disappointment as well however a representative from jal did meat me at vancouver and apologised for the stuff up and even reimbursed me form the booze that i lost when transiting the service of those few both onboard and at destination recovered the experience for me,4
the flight was almost hours long the stewardess were all very helpful and polite ride was smooth we had a red eye flight so we slept most of the flight everything was perfect the carryon compartments were more than adequate and the leg space was terrific never banged my knee once i am tall we were fed two meals and it tasted pretty good for an airline meal the eggs almost tasted like they were just freshly made off the grill my only wish is that my seat cushion recline more toward the backrest my wife and daughter were right next to me and all of us enjoyed the long flight definitely would try japan airlines again everyone provided service with a smile,4
long flights can be the source of anxiety and trepidation flying vancouver singapore and back at least every year is no short haul however knowing i have my jal flight reserved and having every faith in their staff means i can look forward to relaxing catching up with my reading and getting great sleep the lounge in tokyo is great in terms of the meals showers etc connections are convenient i also feel that should there be a delay they would look after my wife and myself which is reassuring also find jal a great way to go to hong kong and saving myself a hour journey,5
we are a family with two people who have long legs this flight was just a dream in terms of space the jal seats are i think the best seats in economy of we had space for our legs and could sleep really well the attendants are really nice in the japanese style of courtesy i want to add the fact that the boarding is wonderfully organised however i will say that the food isnt very good even if they do make an effort continue in this direction we had a problem with the checkin too the website needs to improve quickly,4
jal is a throwback to what the us airlines were like in the s and s impeccable treatment crew bows to the passengers before the plane takes off good food orderly boarding you name it jal does it right,4
we were fortunate enough to fly business class which on jal is amazing however second leg from narita to heathrow was code shared with british airlines their business class is not a patch on jal and was very disapointing,5
very nice flight to japan with good service good food and a wide choice for inflight entertainment refreshments were offered regularily,4
our second trip with jal to london we found jal provides an excellent way to fly to europe if you are not in a hurry to get there a daylight flight to tokyo followed by another daylight flight to london after a nights sleepover and an afternoon arrival makes it much easier to cope with jet lag whilst the pe service in flight is normal jal provides express customs and lounge access we also like the fact that for about a ea we can fly back in business with their excellent lie flat beds for the londontokyo leg sadly only angled flat for nrtsyd for the night flights,5
wheh researching flights to tokyo we looked at flying qantas or jal prem econ and found qantas didnt give you business lounge access whereas jal did access to the qantas business lounge and express customs passes to get you through the lines quicker all that and qantas was k more expensive as well so we went with jal prem ecom and it was so worth it the extra leg room was well worth the additonal cost as well as wider seats you cant beat the japanese for their hospitality friendliness and cleanliness on board as well as their ontime persona it was all great,4
oh my god this is the airline business class on the was absolutely mindblowing the level of service that only the japanese can provide great quality food with a wide variety absolutely tasty cabin crew was just wonderfully welcoming it is sooo clean so comfortable and very very spacious way to go,5
actually travelled may great airline great attentive inflight staff airport staff also excellent courteous efficient food was pretty good for prepackaged airline food with a choice of japanese or english menus we were very lucky to be able to fly business classwell worth the extra moneyso had access to business class lounges at all airports which also were very good would definitely travelled jal again we picked them as they have a good name had a sale on when we booked,5
when returning from tokyo to helsinki we had a very short stopover in nagoya it was a very pleasant experience with jal even though it was only a hour flight the crew served drinks and snacks and gave a toy plane to my daughter the inflight entertainment was working during our journey good company polite staff,4
it take off about am in winter and am in summer from sydney minute would be the least time to check in and board checkin is self or desk the line is always a minimum wait checkin staff and air crew have very good english x kg cases is standard and a standard carry on case the flight is hours with comfortable seating seating is in middle and i very much dislike sitting next to drinkers i am very happy that flying with jal for over years on this flight i never have very pleasant staff from checkin to disembarking at narita price is very reasonable compare with other discount airline on this route,5
there is no direct flight from singapore to shikoku yet my own preference is jal as it has always been known to be prompt i book directly on the jal singapore website jal or ana offers many flights to shikoku but usually the transit in tokyo is from narita to haneda or viceversa however whichever airline you choose there is a major consideration when transiting in tokyo i never like to have to transit from tokyo haneda to tokyo narita airportor viceversa just for the domestic flight its quite troublesome there are unfortunately very few jal or ana flights whose transit airport is the same for the outbound flight the transit at haneda is a bit more problematic you have to pick up your luggage and proceed quickly to the domestic counter to drop them off here i find that the domestic counter staff is pretty slow in handling the queue then you have to take a bus at the bus shuttle area to the domestic terminal the bus leaves every minutes the interval is a bit long then once at the domestic terminal you may have to take a long walk to the gate our transit time was less than hrs so it was a bit rushed we were the last to board the flight for the inbound flight our luggage is automatically transferred to the international flight but we had to ask where to take the bus to the international terminal at the bus stop area there is a big automated machine screen telling you the destination of the incoming bus take only the bus for the international terminal the bus leaves every minutes so thats good our transit time was h minutes but we had plenty of time to shop at the airport dutyfree area all in all a smooth flight the flight meals are average and note that there are no meals onboard the domestic flight the jal counter staff are very friendly and helpful,4
first time flying with jal i have to say that i was very impressed the aircraft was very clean seats comfortable plenty of room the crew were very polite lots of bowing very helpful attentive we flew during daylight hours the flight seemed very peaceful the food was good with some interesting japanese choices as well as western food apart from juices the choice of cold nonalcoholic drinks was limited to the coke range i found that to be a bit irksome not a coke fan a very pleasant experience overall would definitely recommend,5
the seat space and screens are excellent beats the european and american competition by far only problem is that there is flight to mid japan only the southwest part connections to europe are missing,5
couldnt fault this flight the service was excellent the food was delicious and the staff were friendly yet professional checkin was a breeze no problems at all the seats were spacious and comfortable lovely fluffy pillows and large warm blanket well worth the extra money for premium economy for those long haul flights,4
took a round trip flight on japan airlines and it was excellent gracious service from the checkin counter and throughout the flight delicious meals and refreshments to keep you happy and comfortable the flight attendants are very courteous and work hard they take good care of their customers wish all airlines could be the same well be flying jal again in the near future,5
i was not all that well to take this long haul flight but japanese hospitality and care outsmart the health constraints extremely attentive courteous and professional i was really happy to have travelled in jal though i used several times aeroflot in this sector food was just ok and the seat configuration was good but entertainment was not international,4
a slim mattress is supplied to help you sleep on a flat bed a choice is offered between asian and western type food jal takes pride in being on time and pay a lot of attention to detail adding to the comfort of long trips,5
flew from san diego to narita japan first leg second leg from narita to manila no layover to speak of literally from one plane to the next the flight from san diego to narita was virtually empty i took an entire mid seat section in economy folded up the armrests and had a bed the flight attendants were extremely attentive constantly there to serve but of course they didnt have much else to do since there were probably passengers but even on full flights jal always satisfies ive been a frequent flyer with them for years the plane was a dreamliner and it was either brand new or had been kept to that level plus avoiding los angeles i live in san diego the flight only cost total roundtrip and was fast i had large check on and carry on bags and was not charged anything extra for an economy flight this was truly hard to beat,5
the reasons why very comfortable seats that easily converted to equally comfortable flat beds remarkably large individual televisions with a good entertainment selectionincluding classical music too often slighted as well as informative and enjoyable programs on japan great foodcomparable to that served in first rate restaurants on the islands and excellent service on the part of the pleasant and helpful staff i so thoroughly enjoyed my jal flights and was so wellrested that i was almost sorry to land perfect introduction to japan perfect ending,5
flying internationally from boston usually means a stop over somewhere it is such a nice surprise to get a direct flight so i started out happy right there the price was decent for business travel in premium economy and with a premium economy ticket you get access to the lounge at the airport the flight attendants were super nice there was plenty of food and drinks and the entertainment was fine it was also really easy to get in to tokyo city though id say do your research first so you know what you are looking for once you land,4
excellent service from all airline staff all very helpful and polite we needed wheelchair assistance and we were very impressed with the service and care provided,5
relative to other airlines their economy class was great the seats are a bit more comfortable and spacious all the ground staff and flight crew were unfailingly polite and helpful the food was good by airline standards the plane was properly maintained and the price was really good in fact it was so much cheaper than the flights to seattle which was my actual destination that it made sense to fly to vancouver and take the train down that was a delight in itself i think ill make a habit of flying this way oh and since there was a long layover they provided a free room in a decent hotel near the airport highly recommended,5
what i like most is having japanese food and green tea in flight i love jal very much flying to japan with jal is a pleasure,5
flew with jal from japan to sri lanka with a transit in bangkok this was my first time to take this airline and i was really impressed by their service comfort and hospitality the seats were so comfortable and had plenty of legroom the inflight staff was so friendly helpful and offered some delicious food which i chose to have in japanese style most amazing thing which i saw was they treated every passenger specially as if they were personally known to them as ive experienced by living in japan everything inside the flight was so clean and neat i have only traveled in their business class for couple of times and the experience i had was top in its class i recommend jal to anyone without a second thought and would love to travel with them again,5
japan airline is a very good to fly there planes are uptodate although i wish they had more of there planes as three class cabins with a first class cabin there food is excellent along with there service and care i recommend them to fly,4
the best service from checkin at the airport all through the way to my destination the sakura lounge was very good the meal on board was well selected with good choices that you wished to have them all though the recently change in japanese appetizers were a little disappointed flight attendants were attentive and cared for all your needs,5
their service and comfort level really knocks spots of qantas their one world partner with whom i flew the year before this boing flight was a very comfortable and private suite in a herring bone formation with fully flat beds a french champagne led winelist with terrific food list to accompany was like a tapas plate for lunch with individual tastes super service and wide screen tv with wide choice of recent releases a la carte menu on demand really a fine way to travel on par with etihad and virgin pacific beware though if you are transiting through narita even staying flightside the japanese security will confiscate your alcohol even if receipted and sealed in a duty free bag,4
before we even boarded the hospitality lounge was great then the plane excellent service and smiling all the way the food was sensational and they did not try to over provide we ordered as we went the hostess service is the best i have ever had on a plane nothing was a problem and any concerns were quickly overcome many thanks for a safe return to australia,5
we were lucky enough to try the new dreamliner and its amazing that on top of the awesome food and service its probably the best economy class out there ive tried delta korean philippine airlines and none of them comes close cabin lighting it does change like mood lighting its not bothersome at all windows it darkens when its sunny and clear when its dark my comment as well as what ive heard from others is that it doesnt get dark enough that its still bright sometimes hard to sleep food they filled up the tray and lots of food flight attendants going around with ice cream coffe and tea snacks every hours or so seat the seat pitch width and legroom is comparable to what delta sells as economy plus i have nothing bad to say,5
received a very pleasant check in from a lovely young japanese lady her manners and attitude were impeccable flight and service was a little better than average we also were seated in an exit row which i really appreciated they also made sure my wife and i were seated next to each other even though we had booked seperately,4
prompt and accommodating service checkin was a breeze gives off an aura of refinement or elegance limited english options in their inflight entertainment,4
we secured very good prices for our return sydneyparis flights but not having flown jal for many years we were surprised how comfortable and up to date this airline is we had lieflat beds with good matresses large pillows and very nice blankets the food was just amazing we had the japanese menu on the way over and the western menu on the return included in the western menu were lobster tails lots of choise and all dishes were delicious the staff were very attentive and the bathrooms were kept impeccably clean at all times the entertainment system had a reasonable offering of the latest movies but not as good as emirates or etihad this was one of the best flights we have had and we are happy to fly with jal anytime,5
i selected jal for this trip firstly because it was the least expensive premium economy on offer at the time i was flying and secondly because the hour layover would give me a tiny taste of japan which i had not yet visited my ultimate destination was london the premium economy cabin was quiet and the seats were just greatvery comfortableand there was plenty of room for me to stretch my legs out one of the reasons i avoid travelling in economy is that at the age of my knees are not what they were and sitting with them flexed for hours is intolerable i believe the food was the same as economy but i had no complaints on that score i liked the japanesestyle snacks that came with drinksyummy soy beans for example service was impeccable from smiling flight attendants i cant comment about the entertainment because i was reading something engrossing all i watched was the little aeroplane on the flight path display my overall impression of jal was very favourable and i shall certainly consider flying with them again,5
though it was early morning flight it was fully booked since the reservation was done at the advance purchase the cost was less than yen even of j class seat if the strip chedule has been determined early purchase is desirable,4
i was traveling cathay to singapore then jal to tokyo my bags went all the way through food was a choice of japanese or other i opted for japanese and it was lovely the majority of the jal passengers were japanese and the younger passengers opted for a change of food and went for the other i have travelled jal before and i love the friendly polite staff i only had one hour changeover on the return flight my bag and myself got onto the cathay flight note no dawdling head straight for the next gate it is a long walk but you usually need a bit of exercise between longish flights,5
one of the best airways that i have been on flight crew were fantastic aircraft was kept very clean meals served was really great the seats had their own tv screen which was perfect good selection of movies to watch and had video games on it,5
pricing options led us to fly jal on our recent trip to vietnam we flew through narita to hanoi and from ho chi minh city again through narita and back to vancouver check in was a breeze staff exceptionally friendly polite lounge in vancouver does not belong to jal and its pretty basic crowded plaza premium lounge seating in jal business class on the dreamliner is versus most other carriers at the extra two seats come at the expense of seat width legroom is all you need the seats flatten but when fully reclined are at a very slight downward angle toward feet not a big deal but not flat flat either service was very good although the food not close to other carriers offerings again ultra polite staff and very responsive the lounge in narita was excellent we had a two and a half hour layover which was plenty of time to grab a quick shower to wash off the airplane stink from narita to hanoi we were on a series which has these little compartments true lay flat seats and you could exit from the window seat without climbing over the aisle seat again the seating made for tighter quarters but if you were a big person in circumference you might want to stick with an aisle seat jal uses another private lounge in hcm city which was adequate quiet overall we got great value and have booked them for two more upcoming trips to se asia in the next months,4
jal have stepped up their service a notch on flights from sydney to narita the food service is superior to qantas by quite a margin and the staff are always friendly and courteous the flight leaves around am so connecting flights from melbourne can be an issue but jal will provide overnight accommodation at sydney airport free of charge the flight arrives around pm in narita which is peak hour which can be an issue if you are flying out on jal within hours they will also provide accommodation in narita,4
we flew jal in business class between tokyonarita and bangkok both flights were almost full but ground and onboard services were well organized and orderly the ground people handled crowds fairly well with courtesy jal lounge in narita is comfortable the lounge in bangkok was small and crowded,4
we travelled with jal because of a very competitive price generally they are cheaper than competitors on that route it used to be that it was cheaper because of lesser cabin fit out but now they have comfortable lie flat beds and a nicer fit out compared to qantas the real clinchers for jal are service nothing is too much trouble ever cleanliness my husband thinks they clean the toilets after every visitor never water or litter in their toilets and food the food is fabulous but mainly the japanese food my daughter was taking photos of the food all the time the do regular meal times will hold food over for you or theres all flight snacks an absolute must is the miso ramen small niggle is that they want the cabin organised for landing a bit early which was a bit of a pest on the return overnight flight one thing you must do is wear lightweight clothing as they tend to run the air conditioning a bit on the warm side,4
as expected the service on board is excellent friendly courteous service by the flight attendants clean interior comfortable accommodations to make a long flight enjoyable definitely recommend,5
i usually fly business class internationally but this trip was with a group going to a martial arts seminar in okinawa i was impressed with the seating and the service,4
after decades of being in coach jal have been by far the best for me not packed in like sardinesso much more legroom and actual space i could cross my legs now and then and almost sleepreal coffee great japanese inflight food artisticly presentedin economy i was with a little performance tour and had to present every day and travelling on jal made it a lot easier professional friendly but most of all it was more spacious and relaxing definitely trying them again next time,5
this is a great way to travel to asia from san diego without having to go through los angeles the type of aircraft used a boeing is awesome even though we were seated in economy we felt like we had a lot of room because the airplane ceiling height is so high we were served two meals the flight was on time our luggage arrived safely the movie selection and in seat flight entertainment was pretty good the next time i go to japan i will definitely take this flight again,5
excellent service not absolutely certain about the premium economy seats loads of leg room is no good if you cant get comfy the staff were nearly as good as the food,5
never having used this class of ticket i was anxious to see if it were worth the extra charges we make this trip every months and have used many different airlines and have found jal to be the best for our purposes besides it gives us mileage with american airlines having been fed up with the cramped conditions in economy we decided to give the premium a try the cost was a little less than double that of regular economy i dont know how the other companies do it but the extra seating space made what was a hour torture session almost enjoyable besides that the little extras in the snack and beverage departments were very good as usual the jal flight crew was outstanding and extremely accommodating another advantage was that this ticket gains you entrance to the airport clubs normally used by first and business class passengersi know this has been more about the ticket than the airline but jal really needs no superlatives from me,4
truly the best service in the sky great food attentive service and some of the best planes and seats out there i will do my best to always fly jal when i visit japan,5
jal has amazing customer service incredibly friendly staff delicious food and drinks and a good movie selection the planes are comfortable and the ride was smooth they show you menus for food options and offer you amazing things liek kiwi juice and warm or cold green tea when we missed a connection in jakarta on our way home we had to rebook through american airlines they are partners and we booked through them despite not really being able to help and despite the service desk being closed they took us up to the command center and let us use the phone once we rebooked they even checked the records to make sure we had actual tickets they were so nice and i would fly jal all the time if i could,5
the flight attendants were beautiful charming helpfuland a pleasure to be around i wish jal flew to more destinations from lax flying home we got to airport about minutes before they opened and at am all the ticket agents stood and bowed to all of us in linethe flight attendants did the same before we took off on each leg of the trip food and drinks were fabuloustoo much of everything seats and entertainment were perfect,5
this flight from sydney to narita was absolutely seamless after enjoying a delicious breakfast at the qantas first class lounge boarding was a breeze the jal suite seat k was roomy with lots of storage space and a huge viewing screen there are two menu choices western or japanese i chose the japanese which was largely sea food some which was a bit dryover cooked however the salon champagne and sake were top notch would also recommend trying queen of the blue tea a rare treat the english movie selection was very limited just enough for a hour flight however the view out the window of the great barrier reef and other islands made up for this the highlight of the trip was the lovely flight attendants they were attentive and friendly but never too intrusive bravo jal,5
even prior to the economy seat upgrade jal always provided a good experience the flight attendants are wonderful post seat improvements the economy seats are as good as most other airlines economy premium or business seats the food for an airlines is good an enjoyable albeit long flight,5
wow if only the us airlines could learn this very attentive cabin staff entire plane was boarded very quickly and very organized no extra charges for any baggage food was very good,5
service was great even in the economy flight attendants are walking around all the time making sure passengers are comfortable food was great drinksalsowine is complimentary stop over was quick and haneda airport has wifi i will fly jal going to japan definitely,4
smaller seats space kind cramped but not as bad as v ka was much better value i was just not impressed with jal they were presented as a premier airline and they just are not,3
from check in to exiting we had two great flights with jal plenty of check in desks and they didnt care that one bag was a few kgs overweight on board the first thing we noticed is the seats seem to have more space in front than i have recently experienced the service is typical of that we found throughout japan high quailty efficient very polite meals were nice with asian and western choices personal in flight entertainment was excellent id have no hesitation in flying with jal again,5
this airline would have been closer to the top of my list but the food is not even suitable for a zombie attack pros the plane was nice clean and well kept the attendants were pleasant helpful and always had a smile the premium economy is well worth the extra money spent especially for a hour flight no complaints about comfort at all i was also very pleased that i was able to book a seat assignment at the time of purchase of my ticket unlike another asian airline i took to thailand no one wants to get stuck with a seat that doesnt suit their needs when traveling for nearly hours in total that would be a complete nightmare cons the food omg the food face palm lets just start with that it was totally inedible it all looked and tasted like it was made of plastic and came out of a mold im also vegetarian but that doesnt stop me from picking pieces out here and there in between the food that i cant eat especially when i have no control over my environment there is no vegetarian option anywhere for you to choose from either when booking the flight or while in flight it simply does not exist so people with any food restrictions are completely screwed you get what they have which is two meat options and that is it if you are a celiac your screwed diabetic your screwed vegetarian your screwed i tried to eat the fruit cup but it had a weird taste like rubbery gelatin plastic so that wasnt an option either for the nearly hours it took to get to hanoi from sand diego all i ate was bread and butter which i dont normally eat but i was starving why didnt i bring snacks you ask i did and over hours they went quickly my second complaint the in flight movie options are at least years old that totally sucks on really really long flights would i fly them again probably with hesitation i would look to find other available flights first and if i had no other choice i would fly jal again but bring with me a full backpack full of food items,3
very comfortable seating on boeing er good legroom and good onboard entertainment system the flight crew was very hospitable and we had our special meals as booked on time departure and on time arrival the flight was direct and long but their food and refreshment breaks made it easier very satisfied with the overall service on board this flight and return flight as well,4
we had booked a cruise around japan with noble caledonia so the best way to get there was via beijing to tokyo we flew with jal from beijing to tokyo return what a service the seats were large food service outstanding and the best sake i had ever tasted well done all at jal for great service and culture,5
the flight itself was very smooth the pilot was very descriptive when telling passengers about the flight he explained what turbulence was why we go the speed we do etc etc my partner is terrified of flying and this helped sooth her a little bit the flight attendants were extremely polite and caring and considering it was such a large plane it was very spacious the entertainment was excellent as there was a good selection of movies music shows and games the windows of the plan have a dimming feature so you can choose to have the window open without all the sunlight blinding you that was great the food was very good for plane food they fed me so much almost too much but thats not a complaint ever blankets pillows and headphones were all provided the flight itself didnt have much turbulence at all and the landing was smooth highly recommended airline,5
i think we ended up in first class for the jfk to tokyo leg which was awesome we had individual cubbies with fully reclining beds large flat screen tvs and lots of storage room food was great choice of japanese or american and you could order anytime you wanted service was outstanding,5
quite a nice flight clean cabin accomplished attendants not as lavishly appointed as some others and the bed did not fold totally flat good in flight service good media cabin was overall a bit minimalist as i expected flights were timely lounge was very nice overall an a rating,5
the service was excellent for starters it was a fairly large plane so i am assuming there werent that many rows of seats in the economy section because there was so much space between each row its so out of the ordinary that an airline gives you that much space and being ft in i instantly took notice i was seating towards the back of the plane since the upgrade was bucks anyway it was a welcomed surprised the food was not too bad and the flight attendants were great the return flight though was more like the usual pack them like sardines type i am assuming the nice spacious flights are only going to japan and not returning either way the service was something that stood out no complaints there jal checkin service sucks and lacks behind other major airlines the portal is antiquated and it can be confusing even having all your information its hard to maneuver around the site the translation of the japanese site to the english site is definitely the culprit this part of the service definitely needs to improve ten fold i had a transfer in osaka on my return but the first flight wasnt available to check in at the site and no further information on the flight was provided i had to go to terminal at narita and figure out which airline was handling the national flight for jal as that information wasnt provided by jals portal,5
just got off this flight days ago so when i say spacious i mean that there is more space than other economy flights i read that where some airlines have seats on this type of plane jal only had so thats where the extra room comes from its not a dramatic difference but on a long flight you can tell the food is yummy its a nice eclectic japanese fair there is a lot of it too i counted different items for one meal their rice crackers are good too i really just cant say enough about how great jal is this is my nd time to fly with them and both times have been great,5
we had a nice experience on the flight from paris to tokyo even if it was a long flight hours the seat were confortable and wide for the economy class they provided some cushion and cover that we could use to sleep or be confortable overnight the food was very good with a japanese style meal or european style the stewardess came often with different drinks during all the fligth the entertainement was good with a large variety of films in different langages,4
excellent experience in economy it was a dreamliner plane and the flight was very comfortableeven though it was long haul in economy the food quality is excellent and the customer service is wonderful it was also more cost effective than comparable flights on delta china airlines and eva,5
we flew from dfw to toyko and onto hanoi jal has the best service from checkin to landing its obvious that customer service is of utmost concern the business class flatbed seats are comfortable i was disappointed based on my other experiences in business class from various airlines that we werent offered a sleep suit especially on a hour flight followed by a hour layover and another hour flight additionally there is only one toilet per section of business class that was at times inconvenient food selection was of high quality yet offers limited selection overall my experience on jal was a positive one i would definitely consider flying with them again,4
the service was good the food was fine but not memorable the bathrooms were clean the choice of movies was uninspiring but the leg room was excellent even in plain old economy i was amazed by how much space i had,4
my wife and i booked this flight with american airlines miles the first leg bangkok to haneda airport in tokyo was on a regional as such the business class seat was not lie flat although as a daytime flight this wasnt critical the seat was comfortable and the food was quite good as we both had the japanese meal i should also note that business class passengers in bangkok get to use a separate entrance into the immigration and security check one that is much less hectic than that used by economy passengers it was a nice respite from the chaos that is bangkoks departure area from midmorning to midafternoon when we have been in a line an hour long the entire process in the business class line was about minutes transit at haneda was very simple just an escalator up one floor and the gate was right there our layover was about hours arrived around pm well ahead of schedule and departed at just after midnight there was probably time for us to sneak into tokyo for dinner but as this was our first time at haneda we decided not to risk it we found a good sushi stand inside the airport reviewed separately and had a very nice meal there at not too high a price given that it was in the airport the sakura lounge at haneda was quite comfortable and had good wifi service so the time there went by quite quickly the flight from haneda to sfo was on a er the elite bird of jal business class is set up in a configuration however the seats are very private my wife and i had two of the middle seats with her seat being in the exact center and mine being on the aisle the seats were in the small minicabin directly behind first class so there is only a single row there meaning there was a lot of privacy my wife who can be claustrophobic at times had no such complaints even in the middle seat the seats were fully lie flat and i would have to say were about the most comfortable seats ive ever been in ive only had one other business class experience and that was on eva in a configuration the seat there was nice but this was great im tall and had plenty of legroom i also had sufficient body room and didnt have to contort myself into any strange positions in order to lay flat it was about a nine hour flight and we both slept for at least six hours a first for both of us i have read some complaints that jal keeps their cabins too hot but we didnt experience that we didnt need the blanket but neither did we find it too warm being a redeye flight that left at midnight there is only one formal meal and thats about two hours before landing in sfo we each selected the traditional japanese breakfast and i found it very good the only demerit i can give jal is the inflight entertainment on both flights it was pretty blah with not very many selections but at least on the hansfo leg of the flight i didnt care because i slept so soundly we will be taking a repeat trip on jal in december when we return from singapore to sfo also on an aa business class award ticket the main difference will be that jal has changed the schedule so instead of a midnight flight we leave in the early evening unfortunately we had to change our flight going to singapore to cathay pacific because the new flight times meant we would either arrive in singapore very very late or that we would have to have an overnight at the airport neither of which was palatable in summary id highly recommend jal particularly for its transpacific flight,5
realy a pleasant flight very good service smiling and helpful staff the food was typical japanese and very good more than enough space few people,4
i flew jal nonstop from tokyo haneda to san francisco the service i received on the flight was fantastic the flight attendants were consciousness helpful and kind the seats were the perfect size and i actually was able to sleep normally i cant sleep on flights the entertainment was varied and seemed to offer something for everyone in the future i will definitely look to fly jal again,5
my family tries to fly jal whenever we can because we love how kind the onboard attendants are and how helpful they can be everyone but especially to families with very small children we traveled with them when our youngest child was an infant and again when he was a toddler and on both instances we felt supported by the airline staff both on the ground and in the air we had the same experience when traveling years ago when our eldest was an infant and toddler as well too often you hear of stories where airline staff look at travelers with small kids as a source of potential discomfort during the flight we did not get that vibe at all from jal staff throughout any of our trips with them i love how they put effort into little touches to make a hour flight comfortable for kids such as allowing them to pick between a coloring pack or a small plastic model jetliner at the beginning of the flight and having kidspecific meals on the menu to kidfriendly content on their inflight entertainment program street fighter and cartoons always work the food on the jal flights into narita and from there to manila is always good especially for folks who travel on economy like we do theres always a small salad a protein and carb typically japanese themed some miso soup if so desired some green tea or coffee and some haagendazs ice cream for dessert our kids definitely enjoy the ice cream needless to say were fans of jal both from a price perspective and an inflight experience angle we highly recommend them,4
our flight on japan airlines in may was simply amazing the round trip nonstop flight was included in our smartours amazing japan package we were concerned with a hour flight but the service was gr the food was very good and we had plenty of movies for entertainment the hours literally flew by we would definitely fly them again,5
helpful and friendly cabin crew foods and beverages well served with all sort of varieties crew members was helpful in helping to fill in immigration form,4
as ba executive member one world sapphire i booked this short flights from my miles unfortunately with the ba booking code one is unable to manage his flight on the jl website i had to investigate to figure out the jl resevation code once i had it i was shocked to realise that the two of us in spite of both of us being sapphire were seated separately when i tried to change the seats it was impossibel i have never seen such a bad and unfriendly website shame on japan airlines we were also unable to checkin online so we had to go to teh airport early at the airport we were checked in swiftly and got an invitation to the lounge what shall i say appart from the view the lounge was so poor and the design was afwul no food and very limited selection of drinks well below the average of the other oneworld airlines lounges to my great surprise when we entered the plane there were many seats empty even at the windows and i can npt understand why these seats were not shown on the websites when i say plenty i mean at least seats the flight was short and fine nothing extra the staff was nice but not very friendly very average,1
we had booked to fly from kagoshima to the island of yakushima for a couple of days and then from yakushima on to osaka unfortunately our flight from kagoshima was delayed due to weather which would require we overnight catch a flight later the next day technically we could have done this but one day on the island was not very appealing we worried the bad weather could continue our tickets were totally non refundable the agents at japan airlines in kagoshima were amazing they agreed to refund our ticket to yakushima in full then rebook us to osaka that evening at no additional cost and they called our hotel in yakushima our car rental to cancel they turned a big disappointment into a very positive experience thank you,5
have not use jal for some time and it was a pleasure to be back the planes are older than say cx or sq but food and in flight service is still excellent in flight entertainment system is defective and programme can be better another unusal practice plenty of empty seats on c class but check in counter put me next to someone it was easy to arrange a seat without any passenger sitting next to me,4
one of the best airlines ever good food great hosts comfortable seats i do recommend this airline to anyone,5
flew jal for the first time after finding a decent price so jal can offer reasonable fairs i lousily tick wrong flight my bad and end up with wrong timing help desk was appreciable and did their job help took a red eye flight maybe the quietest for the last years well not much too say because all went smooth i am just not fan of their coffee served from transparent plastic container and food can be slightly better a little too much rations to open for me i do love japanese food but the dressing in a kawai plastic bag to rip was not a good idea gentleman seating next to me can confirm rip to his shirt try to preferably land take off in haneda than narita it is more accessible and closer overall quite happy with all the smiley staff,4
checkin was speedy and efficient i liked the soothing dark brown decor of the business class cabin i was offered the use of a jal sweater for sleeping they ran out of the japanese bento box meal optionwhich was a disappointment lounge at narita airport was very crowded had to go to three stores in the airport before i found my favorite white chocolatecovered potato chips,4
love this airline excellent service and excellent food very clean have flown jal many times the only thing you need to know is if you are flying from sfo to bangkok you have to change planes and airports we learned this the hard way two years ago when we had to get a bus and travel across tokyo to the other airport in the wee hours of the morning after flying for hours did not have to change airports in the past lesson learned will not be using jal again to get from sfo to bangkok that said i highly recommend this airline for other destinations,4
excellent company service in the plane and outside in the airports were truly impeccable and courteous a rarity these days the planes were clean and the toilets were regularly rearranged in a hours flight that really matters,5
after much problems dealing with fair depot on our flight changes the lady at jal was absolutely the best at fixing the proble very calm courteous and went out of her way note get your deal from those booking sites then phone the airline directly most will match the price and you get better change and cancellation options and costs the jal flight was comfortable the food was okay prefer business class who wouldnt but for economy i would do it again jal also had free baggage where other airlines was only one,4
ive flown all over the world with many different airlines including air madagascar air france united cathay pacific air canada etc and i have to say that japan airlines has the best economy seats of all of them the jal economy seat is superior to many premium economy seats on other airlines plenty of leg room im and could still see my toes with my leg stretch straight service was great as always like many other asian airlines food and entertainment system was on par or better than other airlines after flying with jal economy i have decided to continue to fly on economy in the future and put my savings elsewhere if jal can offer such great product theres no reason for other airlines not to do so i guess theres a reason why jal economy is ranked in the top on skytrax the only complaint i have is the onboard temperature jal likes to set its ac temperature slightly higher than other airlines so i strongly suggest passengers to wear short sleeves on the flight however jal has not updated all their planes with these wider economy seats so make sure to verify when booking,5
the bigger the plane the better the story but thats pretty common plane flights are not the most fun of experiences hours in the air are rather wearing being able to walk around a bit andor stretch is nice on earlier ana flights and qatar many years ago they were kind enough to allow a few of us to quietly stand near the back looking out the rear window went a long way to relieving strainpain guess jal does not believe it allowing that however what i noticed the most was the difference between how this was communicated by japanese i assume crew and the crews that seemed to be manned by more western folk like me this difference carried throughout all interactions the difference in politeness was frightening sobering and until i steeled myself to it on the return aggravating had forgotten all of this until i just got the notice that tripadvisor was adding airlines happy to share this they didnt seem to mind how they treated me and i am happy to return the favor contrast this with my almost nauseating string of positivism for almost everything else i have ever reviewed d,3
we flew economy on a smaller jet to tokyo it sat across with good leg room a surprise so there wasnt that much inconvenience with having to move out for people in the center snacks were available throughout the flight the meals were delicious ginger pork or steamed fish miso soup ice cream and the service impeccable the flight was smooth with slight turbulence as expected a great way to start our day trip in japan weve always loved jal,5
so much better than the european alternatives over the last years ive tried almost every imaginable airline to take me the miles from the uk to japan some were good the now defunct virgin upper class some were grim klm some airports are fine birmingham some just awful heathrow and some just too far from anywhere narita so i think the best compromise is jal from t yuck to haneda yeah the new jal economy seats are ok the service is fine and the food is mixed their uk based caterers are poor and their japan based caters very good so you might want to take some sardines with you for the outbound flight however for a fee you can upgrade to premium economy and get some extra legroom extra elbow room and access to a washlet toilet with a bidet the pe area seemed quieter than back in economy so youve got more of a chance of a pillfree sleep and at haneda you can escape from the masses by using their premium economy checkin queue and retreat to their sakura lounge which was ok not great just ok but it did have those fancy washlets,5
i had read good reviews of this airline and booked our round trip flight to tokyo i am so sorry that i did not upgrade the seats were terribly uncomfortable and hard as rocks there were three of us traveling and each of us was in pain when we reached our destination the service was good and the meals were somewhat better than domestic international flights having a usb port at each seat was also helpful for a long flight,3
positively surprised of the professionalism and service of jal on the way to japan we took a finnair flight to fukuoka and had a stopover there due to the amount of people lining up for passport check in fukuoka we missed our connecting flight to tokyo we contacted the jal staff at the airport and they quickly got us new tickets and sent us a away only one hour after the flight we were supposed to take on the way back we took jal again but due to mechanical issues the departure was delayed for over an hour we were to miss our connecting flight from paris to helsinki and the flight attendant apologized profusely whilst explaining this she told us to contact the jal ground staff in paris about this which we did the staff in paris was very helpful and arranged everything for us we didnt have to be worried at all and felt well taken care off,5
we were treated like royalty the courtesy shown to us was unbelievable from all jal staff both here and in japan we had to change airports to continue on to hokkaido a first for us but it went so smoothly totally due to the staff and their helpfulness would only ever fly with them again to japan,5
the inflight meal was the best among all the carriers that serve the route they had japanese style cold noodles haagen daz and even miso soup for economy class passengers i was so impressed the seat was a bit old and tight but it was ok for a hours flight there was inflight personal tv service was excellent and the cabin staff regularly checked on the passengers to see if they have any needs they always service with great smile and attitude,5
one of the best flights i have ever experienced check in was speedy the lounge was great the crew were amazing and overall the flight was as good as any i have ever had,5
a flew with jal codesharing from budapest to london it was british airways from london to tokyo it was japanese airlines it was the third flight in my life and first with japanese airlines i and my girlfriend already had experience with british airways alitalia lufthansa klm and airfrance jal is so far the best ever the legroom is big enough the chairs are also big too im not a small men cm kg so it was a miracle to have enough place ive never felt it before the cabin attendants were extremly kind and they were smiling all the time whatever i asked they answered kindly not like at the other air companies above the plane was really clean and the service was amazing this is what i was expecting from a japanese company even the foreign cabin attendants treated us and and worked like the japanese staff the food was brilliant the amount was enough we got several meals like in japan and everything was high quality and unbeleivable tasty we could choose western and japanese style meal both we asked for japanese style it was the tastiest meal what i have ever eaten on board the dessert was also amazing we got häagendazs icecream twice and japanese puding jelly seasonal fruits and sweets other good points variation of drinks and snacks western and japanese snacks x times more kinds than in the other air companies umeshu japanese plum wine many kinds of tea true green tea barley tea etc fast checkin free foreign magazines and books in the lobby no delay even minute very interesting games and films even brend new films high tech remote controller price in my opinion jal beats all of the european air companies easily the only air company which is close to jal is lufthansa but if you buy a ticket in a good time it can as cheap as alitalia or finnair,5
once again we see the difference between us and international especially asian airlines for my trip i flew outbound with american but returned on jal a oneworld partner airline the aa seat wasnt even a full lie flat for a flight all the way from chicago to tokyo the jal was completely lie flat and included an ergonomic mattress in the overhead bin that you could use at your discretion it also included a special ergonomic pillow the aa seat included a low def seat back screen perhaps inches in size the jal included a or inch i dont remember which high def screen at each seat the food options were better and could be ordered at any time during the flight via a small touch screen remote at your seat theres all kinds of little differences its the attention to detail that makes you realize how much better other airlines are,5
we took a flight to heathrow to narita via helsinki transit we compared two type of carrier ie jl from helsinki to narita has wider sheet boeing with two row at the economy class while ba has a normal sheet with three row at the economy jl has a electric power plug v it was very convenient for me to go to a bathroom,5
once again the jal website showed itself to be the only weak spot in an otherwise outstanding operation even the cross keys concierge at the mandarin oriental could not check my husband in and print his boarding pass although she did so for me without any problem so we arrived at the airport a little bit early the counter clerk was able to check my husband in efficiently another employee actually escorted us to the first class lounge although it wasnt hard to find and we dont need any assistance the lounge itself has both a sushi bar and a saki bar two of my favorite things on multiple trips to each i realized i was the only woman in the lounge who was not a jal employee that changed slightly as our flight time neared but clearly most jal first class passengers are male our flight left a little bit late but made up the time before arrival first class was so comfortable but then so was the business class we flew going over in fact had i known how good the business class was i would have saved some ffms and flown business class back i have a new favorite airline im not rating the inflight entertainment because i read my kindle ate their wonderful food and slept for hours,5
dont let jals difficult website prevent you from flying this great airline we chose jal because we are in the one world alliance and our primary carrier american does not have a nonstop flight to osaka where our tour was starting jal knew several hours before that our flight would be delayed because of a problem on the incoming flight they sent us two emails and phoned us to let us know so that we could avoid arriving at the airport too early the flight itself was lovely although the business class seats were not marketed as flatbed with a little fiddling with the controls i was able to make the seat into a flatbed that and the quiet atmosphere along with what i assume is a good air circulation system allowed me to get several hours of sleep something i find difficult to do on most flights the food was very tasty with choices of western or japanese for all meals i hope to travel to japan again and if i do i hope i can fly jal,5
i fly often overseas from the us ive come to love japan airlines for their level of service and attention to detail the flight attendance are always nice and polite and youll always feel special on their planes the economy seats have more room than any other airline ive flown and the bathroom are well maintained throughout the flights as welli will always fly on this airline when possible,5
fabulous and courteous service newly maintained aircraft comfortable skysuite with large monitors and very good food and wine is what make jal a great airline,5
truly exceptional cabin crew service and attention to detail flew united airlines the other direction awful by comparison,5
i was worried about traveling overseas with a yearold but the staff on jal were fantastic on all legs of our trip they went out of their way to make our ride pleasant such as holding meals until after my son woke from his nap and bringing fresh milk without my asking they were always ready with a smile making it a fun experience for both of us on the return flight i asked a question at the checkin counter about my ticket for a different leg and they not only answered it but later two different supervisors followed up to make sure that there were no problems i certainly would recommend jal,5
i sometimes use jal between japan and bkk or vice versa normally they are night flights and i find it always strange that there is no dinner served but only a breakfast they have a choice between japanese and western breakfast but to be honest there is not much of a difference they use a b for this leg which is super the staff is overly attentive and friendly and keeps on bowing in the japanese way even if they are thais they are all you can wish for but if you are not japanese or not accustomed to their culture you might find the experience somewhat strange still prefer jal over the tg flight on the same route though tg uses an a,4
following considerable research we settled on flying jal for our return flight from frankfurt we had flown on other airlines on the outward journey so were amazed at the quality of comfort and service on the jal flights compared to the business class of the other airlines,5
we often fly japan airlines on our way to and from europe this flight was as good as always the staff are wonderful the food is excellent and the business class seats are very good and one of the best aspects is that we can stop over in fabulous and safe japan both going over and coming back,5
quite frankly i was disappointed in this airline i have flown many asian carriers including a few japanese i found the service to be on par with american standards but not up to the japanese standard that i have grown accustomed to on the trip to bangkok from haneda we flew a newer that was a nice aircraft with good leg space and new entertainment screens on the return trip we flew an older that was very cramp with small and barely visible small video screens while the attendants are nice and always have a smile they dont provide the service that ive experienced or the feeling of being wowed as i do on the other japanese carriers food quality was poor but beverage service was often,3
jal is such a brilliant airline with great service and high quality meals it was quite memorable because the flight delayed for more than hours and we were stuck on the plan with no aircon due to heavy snow i was very impressed with one of the fa she was very patient to take care with the passenger who sit next to me he was very ill and he found difficult to breath she was very kind to keep an eye on this passenger for the whole journey however the planes jal uses for hong kong route are quite old especially the entertaining facilities and the seats,4
exactly what you want from a business class trip a great lounge good food good liquor a comfortable bed wifi and a bit of entertainment all politely and professionally executed we love the due to its higher cabin pressure and humidity the new lieflat seat is a huge improvement over the original angleflat seats jal installed on these planes everyone has their own little cubicle and their own direct aisle access theres a sliding partition between the seats that you can lower if youd like to chat with your neighbor the food looks a bit like an ekiben train station bento when it comes out but its several notches tastier i appreciated that you could eat more quickly than if theyd brought all of those little things out one at a time everything was delicious and served with care the video system was great it has a smartphonelike remote control that was easy to use there was more than enough programming to keep us both busy for the duration of the flight they also have inflight wifi provided by tmobile for the whole flight for hours or for one hour they have turndown service with mattress pads and duvets they dont offer full pajamas unfortunately just a cardigan top love the selfserve bar and the midnight snack menu would happily take this flight again,5
we were pleasantly surprised by flying jal on an aa codeshare flight from kuala lumpur back to usa the staff was extremely friendly and attentive i have to stress again how happy we were with the staff they genuinely appeared to enjoy their job and were in great spirits this was a hour flight so there were meals and a snack served the food was still airplane food so not that great but it was far better than any other weve experienced the breakfast was extremely edible featuring yogurt fruit and an omelette i cant recall the other meal but it was edible too the snack was raw smoked salmon on croissant gross but i got some rice crackers instead there was a blanket and pillow standard on long flights but they were much nicer than other airlines with a decent pillow case and a thick big blanket i took mine home for my next aa flight i had a couple of beers no charge nice as well all in all it was a great flight the airplane was very clean and the inflight entertainment had a great variety screens were big also to note the pitch and seat size are bigger than those junk aa flights boarding was great as well unlike other airlines jal boards from the rear of the plane making it much easier to get in and there arent people constantly walking over you to get to their seats,5
the inflight experience was simply excellent from the time i walked into the cabin until i deplaned the flight attendants were very courteous friendly and attentive the seat pods were spacious and very comfortable the beverage and meal selections were also very meticulously prepared its as if i was dining in a michelin starred restaurant the only down side to my trip was the customer service on the ground i had a flight cancellation due to weather massive snow storm in new york city my original destination per the rules they dont have to reaccommodate me on another airline anas flight to jfk was not cancelled and had availability in first class but jal refused to put me on that flight which is well within the rules jals next flight with availability was days later they offered to fly me to lax and then asked that i work with american airlines once i get to lax for an onward flight to jfk when i got to lax american airlines informed me that jal has not endorsed my ticket over to them when i went back to jal to explain this they informed that they have seeing that the fullybooked jfk flight was leaving soon i opted to purchase the ticket instead of waiting on jal and american airlines to figure out the error jal was well within their rights to follow the rules however this is what sets apart the very good carriers from the excellent ones ive had similar situations with singapore airlines and cathay pacific and they have yet to follow the rules during those situations they understood readily that they want to make things right if it was at all possible,3
we had very pleasant flight with jal seating was very spacious even in economy the new sky suite interior works perfectly staff was very helpful and friendly especially when my son got stomach problems ife inflight entertainment had big selection of latest movies food was one of the best ive ever eaten in flights small minus is the seat it was bit hard and the actual seat very short so for guys sized as me cm my legs got numb because i didnt had decent leg support from the seat other negative thing was pricing of the onboard wifi with those prices person only person using the wifi is the guy whom employer pays it but all in all i can recommend flying with jal,5
when flying with japanese carriers you can be assured of polite and good service at least in most cases this time jal has proven as a very good value to me with advance purchase you get low fare not much more then lcc with two pieces of luggage yes two pieces lots of legroom space good audio and video selection but captain and staff kept talking so much for so long that almost half of the flight we were not able to listen or view anything still best value for money to me,4
great food a bit behind the best of what singapore airlines offers but still delicious and better than the vast majority of international flights great service stewardesses were very friendly and proactive for negatives for me personally i enjoy anime greatly and i dont think i am alone in that i would like the inflight entertainment system to have multiple anime options but this flight did not offer anime at all i do have anime on my laptop so i watched it there instead so not a big issue but would be nice for this not to be necessary,5
your comfort is their utmost concern given that in business class i have flown with jal using economy and i can compare that service is top notch i can never get enough of the japanese food served onboard,5
have flown cattle class with jal a few times and have always been impressed by the quality of service and cleanliness of the aircraft was nice to fly business class and they really do look after you checkin was easy and the lounge was a really nice place to sit oh and putting us up in a transit hotel was no fuss and wellorganised,4
cabin crew service is the best and food is so tasty seat is comfortable and clean lot of variety on entertainment selection you will never get bored comparing aa with jal is like a motel vs a star hotel i cant find anything to complain about,5
cabin crew speak cantonese japanese and english food its aways tasty even in economy class i flight once a month and i am always amazed by the service quality schedule is always on time and staff are very helpful if you are traveling with kids cabin crew always make sure you assist inland or on air,5
what a great airline of years of air travel i would rate jal amount the top the services were great from ground staff to the flight crew you can tell from their body language that theyre genuinely happy to serve the of us occupied rows of seats on both trips i felt there was more leg room than the other airline one thing that impressed me most was the cleanliness of the toilets at the end of the flight after hrs they remained spotless each passenger was allowed x kg of luggage however you have to pay for wifi highly recommended,5
they are at the time of my flight the only one to fly the b with layout abreast in economy as it was designed initially by boeing while today all airlines have configured it bravo jal for that the service is a bit cold but impeccable i would pay extra to fly with their without hesitation,5
excellent flight awesome cabin crew and nice food seats are comfortable as far as airline seats go and there was lots of overhead storage room love to travel again,5
when i fly back to japan i fly with the carrier that i know that i can trust and the trust that i have that i get a quality service on board the service offered is based on the concept of omotenashi a very inportant cultural concept in japanese society to lookafter visitors and eachother both cabin crew and ground staff for jal always make sure you feel welcome when you fly with them,4
from the checkin counter to the boarding to the welcome aboard to the food and service by far the best on time airline in the world,5
the honolulu service is considered mainly for leisure so jl does not offer their best on its hawaii services and there is no amenity bag but lots of stuff given including a lovely pair of slippers and a shoe horn yet the service the food and the whole experience was very very good as good as my experience on sq the aircraft was spotless the flight attendans were excellent the wine was good as a comparison i took ba from london to boston couple of weeks beforehand and would rate the service much lower than what i received from jl and am a gold card for life with ba only negative issue is their entertainment system which is not that good,5
four experiences on jal service is consistently outstanding but the overall experience varies considerably w sky wider excellent inches of pitch seat width and a configuration make this one of the best economy seatingcabin experiences out there clean refurbished interior the small seatback cubbin is perfect for charging an iphone the usb port being right below it seat cushion gets uncomfortably hard after hours however remember some of these flights are hours nice clear large seatback video monitor avod maps function was useful but moviegameinfo choices are monotonous and poor quality it is especially pleasant that these seats have very limited recline there is little noticeable intrusion into ones personal space from a surprise recline by the person sitting in front plenty of overhead bin space in this aircraft too service was outstanding hot towel services full meals another snack meal and at least beverage services on the way over was plenty from a service standpoint flight crew professional courteous and responsive peculiarly the captain does little communicating with passengers compared to american carriers at least meal quality was okaytogood on two occasions almost tasteless on the third snacks are bland insubstantial and probably will upset your stomach over a long haul flight non sky wider good the seat configuration on this aircraft makes for a comfortable cabin feeling seats have just enough pitch for comfort but are made uncomfortable when the person in front reclines the recline is such it restricts access to your tray table and makes it very difficult to get up and go the lavatory avod okay overall but not great in terms of quality options screen clarity or easeofnavigation annoying power box restricts leg comfort at least in the window seats service outstanding again and one meal service plus two beverage services is plenty for a four hour flight but the food was pretty much tasteless or tasteless with vinegar added snacks not very tasty and will probably upset your stomach non sky wider okay the dreamliner has larger windows and a window tint adjustment that is helpful the latter takes some getting used to as the controls are on a delayed response and operate somewhat counterintuitively i wonder if the control function will eventually break or fall into disuse the circulated cabin air does seem to be fresher in the and the lavatories are larger and more pleasant than typical the seat pitch is not quite enough with deep seat reclines by the person in front it will knock food off your tray table when the person suddenly reclines in front of you avod screen quality okay movie game info selections seemed of low quality or canned though food okay but not really tasty snacks dry and salty will probably upset your stomach cabin was clean but i noticed seat upholstery coming apart on the seat in front of me sky wider good comfortable cabin seat configuration dreamliner advantages of bigger windows fresher air nicer lavatories adequate seat pitch of inches and adequate seat width but annoying intrusion by seat recline in this aircraft seat cushion is inadequate and slightly less good than in sky wider in this aircraft it becomes uncomfortable in hours so bring your own pillow also the seat placement posts in this version of sky wider do not maximize leg room as does the version in this version the seat post to the floor does not allow you to comfortably stretch out your legs on both sides of the seat post as does the avod okay but map function on this version difficult to navigate and use great screen image quality but again seems like low quality choices of video one tasty meal one bland tasteless meal poor quality and insubstantial snacks again likely to upset your stomach on a long haul flight of sitting service outstanding as always summary the sky wider is the design that needs to be copied to the other versions very limited seat recline preserves the personal space of the passenger and allows him to get out to go to the lavatory without incident maximized leg room by careful placement of the seat anchor posts and elimination of power boxes makes the seating experience comfortable on a long haul flight as is upgrade the snacks and beverages and restrict seat recline to inches on all versions and the overall score a composite of four flights moves from to stars pure mango juice would be a great option on routes like these add chocolate varieties of ice cream rather than only simple vanilla etc apply the version of sky wider to maximize legroom and it goes to stars add a comfortable seat cushion for a long haul flight and japan airlines is stars even without consistently good meals,4
the review includes my experience in booking their tickets i made a mistake when i bought their tickets in january hence i decided to search for their local number only to realise they have a number meant for all english and mandarin speakers and it is not a local number called in and asked for help the customer representative was help and offered to assist in making the amendment after i have sent in a copy of my passport i promptly did it but there was no news for a working day called them subsequently and mistake was remedied this was not the standard for a japanese company the flight from singapore to tokyo was great with good entertainment system the flight from tokyo to singapore showed dated entertainment system and seat overall a decent flight but i prefer ana having tried it in,3
the flight was on time services were good stewardess were helpful and i got basinette seat for my baby need more improvement on food and the entertainment,3
telephone service i waited to minutes before speaking to anyone i have food allergies i read the menus online before leaving and realized that i was allergic to almost everything i spent about minutes on the phone with an agent he was able to recommend a hindu vegetarian meal as my best alternative although i am in no way vegetarian it ended up being one of the best meals that i have ever had on a flight i also explained that i had a foot injury that made long flights difficult i was placed in a bulk head seat i could not have been happier as i was able to get up stretch and even use a tens machine during my flight this was a minutes well spent with a calm professional agent boarding agents our flight from toronto to chicago was about an hour and minuted delayed i had a two hour connection i hustled over the jal counter at my gate the boarding agent was welcoming friendly and did her best to calm everyone on my flight that had sped walked she ensured that i had the seat that i had requested actually gave me a better seat and even checked to make sure that my luggage made it onto the jal flight she told me exactly how much time i had before boarding before boarding i was assured that my luggage had made the flight i will say that in japan at nrt they were very strict on the weight limit i was about a kilo over and had to repack i thought that was a bit harsh after repacking stuff into my carryon i was then somehow kilos over with my carryon which they actually weighed i complained that this was unreasonable it took up about minutes of my time and they let it goi think it is because i made the boarding agent lift my suitcaseit was almost her height and i thought that she was going to tip over flight attendants i have never seen flight attendants that keep the same level of professionalism attention to detail and courtesy throughout an entire flight they never looked jaded and looked genuinely happy to be working in their jobs i loved the safety presentation it was graceful and introduced me to the bowing culture every flight attendant made it a point to say goodbye to everyone as they were leaving deplaining as my foot condition was listed in the passenger information list they checked on me almost every two hours to make sure that i was ok and did not require help they were also very efficient in terms of getting drinks or snacks to you a wait of no more than minutes tops i was incredibly impressed with the calmness they demonstrated with my grumpy elderly neighbour that did not want to stow her bags in the overhead compartment they managed to calm her down without grabbing her bags or raising their voices seats the seats in economy are ergonomic there is a great neck pillowlumbar support pillow that supports your neck and back very well i sat at the bulkhead so i cannot comment on the spacing in a normal seat but the bulkhead is fabulous and on my flight no one bothered to walk across in front of our row food if you have any sort of allergy to seafood or fish make sure that you order a special meal on the way down i had the hindu vegetarian meal it actually did not taste like plain food and was completely satisfying the only thing that was not is the fact that i was not allowed to have a haggen dazs ice cream because i ordered a nondairy meal i tried to explain that i was not hindu and was not allergic to dairy but that was lost in translation on the way back from tokyonarita to boston i did not order a special meal as hamburg steak was listed as the meal hamburg steak is actually not beef but a chicken patty sort of with pieces of seafood in it served with rice that also has seafood in it luckily i ate in narita hours before boarding as i could not eat any of that meal even the salad had bonito flakes and shrimp i think the snack was a beef noodle box which only had a packet of seafood something to add if desired my other gripe is that the sake brand on jal is awful and the coffee is borderline nonconsumable stick to the green tea or juice on jal inflight entertainment this was the only thing that was not good the english movies are limited on the way down the movies were from years ago the music was also fairly dated on the way back from nrt to boston there was a much better selection of recent movies and slightly better music i found that strange as the plane from ohare to nrt was actually newer the system is not that intuitive to use it took me about minutes to get to english movies i pressed a whole bunch of buttons and eventually found it if you have a dvd or ipad and any sort of ipod or walkman i recommend bringing it for jal flights baggage claim this was also surprisingly efficient i dont recall waiting more than minutes connecting flights i connected from nrt to a itm osaka the boarding agents realized that i could make the early flight advised me of this and bumped me up so instead of having to endure a hour layover i was out of tokyo an hour later the plane from tokyo to osakaitm was an old school boeing plane out of the s if was clean but definitely looked shabby drinks were served as was some wonderfully delicious candy on the way out i was so tired that i did not observe anything else on that flight checkin and jal points you can check in to days before your flight if you sign up for a jal points card the check in is a lot faster,4
the configuration of business class is great very much like a first class seat the food is very good and the service is right up there with korean airlines for politeness the first class lounge at narita is also very good they have a fresh sushi bar the only limitation is if you are not japanese and you travel the airline a lot youll run out of decent entertainment on the flight highly recommended,5
wed been to europe twice before with other carriers flying economy class this time we decided to use jal business class and we are so pleased that we did so the skysuite cubiclestyle seats used on the s on the sydneytokyo route and on the s and s on the tokyoparisfrankfurt routes give you comfort you might expect of st class in many airlines the ability to fully recline the seat into a completely flat bed with a comfortable mattress pillow and blanket in the semiprivacy of a cubicle means that you can get a really good sleep and arrive feeling refreshed on our return from our final destination london we did the entire trip to sydney via frankfurt and tokyo with no stopovers except for the few hours between flights and yet we were still in reasonably good shape when we finally stepped off the plane you couldnt do that with economy class the skysuite is a great concept with its tv monitor and numerous storage compartments and large stowable table my wife who normally hates flying because of the cramped conditions and inability to sleep was full of praise for jals business class and said she would be very happy to fly to internationally with them again we loved the food too when does anyone say that about an airline the meals we ate aboard were of wonderful quality and imagination we generally ordered the japanese choices and were treated to imaginative cuisine better than you would eat in most japanese restaurants food service was sensibly timed too a large and leisurely main meal about hour after takeoff then you could order a wide range of other foods during the flight on a casual basis the cabin staff were just wonderful they were incredibly attentive always ready with a smile and very caring nothing was ever too much trouble for them jal can be congratulated on the standards of service their staff deliver which i would rate as being of the highest order the ground staff and lounge staff were all superb too we watched baggage being loaded into jal aircraft and were really impressed at the deliberation and care shown in the way it was handled the aviation of the flight too was perfect the aircraft was well flown and landings were very smooth wed rate the as being marginally better than the s as the seems quieter inside we had seats h and k on all four jal flights so a direct comparison is possible negatives the pa announcements in english are sometimes hard to understand it is unfortunate that the individual air vent nozzles provided for most seats are not available with the skysuites the cabin was rather hot c and it would have been nice to have been able to direct cool air onto ones face at times it is a pity that the aisle seats could not have been spaced so that the storage alcoves near the passengers head had a window at the end of them window seat passengers have no less than windows available to them and when belted in it is impossible for the aisle seat passenger to lean forward enough to look out the window adjacent to the partition between the seats minor issues though given the excellence of the skysuite concept overall i would rate jal as an outstanding airline and from now on it will be our choice whenever we go overseas,5
excellent flight brand new dreamliner plane with state of the art infotainment system awesome cabin crew and decent food seats are comfortable as far as airline seats go and there was lots of overhead storage room it beat the pants of their partner airline aa on the flight home,5
i take a flight from bangkok to japan and transit to take another flight to dfw usa i was impressed by new airplane dreamliner food amazing they serve hagendas not nestle or walls i love that you even can find toothbrush in the wc for economy,5
booking in was very easy did it at the airport the aircraft was a dream liner and even in economy there was a ton of legroom i fell asleep and when i woke up the stewardess had left a not to contact her if i wanted some dinner or a drink dont that sort of service often flight left on time and arrived on time take note lufthansa,5
one of the biggest mysteries in commercial aviation is why this airline is not ranked up there with the best in many major international rankings from my experience jal is one of the best airlines in the world the service on both my flights with jal was extremely friendly and warm the cabin crew greeted me warmly and were helpful with small requests i had some of the most delicious meals on board and the portions are also generous the seats on the refurbished b aircraft operating the singaporetokyo route are the best ive flown on inches seat pitch inches seat width you cant get that on some major airlines these days in terms of inflight entertainment systems passengers can get to their movie after one or two ads and not five or six on the gulf carriers drink service is also very regular on a seven hour flight checkin is certainly very friendly and processional bags are on the belt within minutes after disembarking in tokyo and singapore id put jal down as my first choice to japan in future,5
my family of four adults child and oneyearold baby travelled on japan airlines for the first time ever international and domestic flight and we were impressed i would definitely fly again with them the service food seat comfort entertainment and flight punctuality were on par with singapore airlines my usual preferred airline for international flights and in some ways better the child meals were generally healthier but still very tasty and beautifully presented the types of toyschildrens souvenirs offered were more useful i ended up collecting several of childrens cutlery sets and i particularly liked their collection of wooden toys sadly i didnt manage to collect all of them but the best thing of all was the complimentary carseat provided for the baby we had booked a seat for him as he is much too big to fit into a bassinet and is too fidgety to stay on a lap as he was under japan airlines provided a carseat for him on all three flights i just had to submit a request about a week before our first flight and provide a couple of measurements so they could set it up for him he was so comfortable and settled in the carseat that it made those three flights so much more pleasant for all of us the domestic flights with qantas between adelaide and sydney were a nightmare in comparison if only other airlines would provide a similar service we were also impressed with their landside service and their awesome loan strollers at the airports in japan which had ample storage space for hand luggage and steered like a dream the loan strollers provided by the airports themselves were just ordinary umbrella strollers the only mildly annoying point was the language barrier which resulted in some confusion when we asked whether passengers with travelling with young children had priority boarding a sign showed that this was meant to be the case but they werent letting other families through a fellow passenger kindly translated our request into japanese and we were allowed to board first,5
love the new jal logo and the new planes these days they have great leg room and the seat are good best of all the meal serve is good and we like it the server is a litle rush some time maybe due to language or timing but all in all we love the meal and drinks you get alcohol water juice then miso soup thats lots for a lunch meal ent set was good too have lots of new movie and brand new though there is still old planes and we got one on the way back but the food makes up for it,4
ladies gentlemen i wish tripadvisor would already have this flight review function earliier there are so many flights that could have been reviewed but overall in the past years months days airlines trying to always seek room for improvement and japan airlines has improved dramatically comparing my last jl flight to this one you can clearly see the improvement but still they are a little picky about how many icecreams are being passed onto their business class passengers or they need to check if there is still bread available which is unacceptable if a passenger wants an icecream or a bread especially in business class so give him a piece of bread or an icecream also i tink you headsets belong to an economy class but you do offer slippers which is fine mouthwash in your lavaotories but no actual towels as a man with a bit of beart you will see that you are having difficulties in drying your face there will be paper fragments all over your face and you have to wash your face again and again save is waste member of staff extremely friendly but i dont think that you need to reject offering icecream or more bread to a passenger if you dont want to offer whiskey to a passenger simply dont write in on your menu please make your passengers happy and let them have a pleasant journey small details can make a big difference your airline lounges are pretty nice your food and beverages very well prepared you even have a locker for baggages which is great the passengers dont have to carry their items all around the lounge but simply lock their belongnings which is wonderful and extremely convenient will fly again great airport great airline but there is better worse etihad emirates and qatar are setting standards and exceed expecations of passengers but those are your rivals,4
this onehour flight was with boeing yes it was an old plane yet the cabin looked clean and well maintained no snacks offered only coffee tea or soft drinks given the service was good and efficient no ptv onboard and the inflight magazine is in japanese language as this was a connecting flight from garuda the transfer service was a breeze and all i did was took my luggage from the belt and after custom i went to the transfer check in desks for jals domestic flight and leave my luggage there,4
the flight is good the service is good the meal ok wifi onboard are available hours hours or a day but not available when in above china territory and alaskan area flight to america depends on satellite but you could use roaming partner of your mobile phone account too but my cabin luggage could not put above my seat because some of passenger cabin luggage put on my area by the stewardess she is know i got cabin luggage but she dont care i complained and they just saying sorry about that,4
we had ever flown japan airlines before decided to give it a go and do premium economy in a nutshell while the service was good the seats were pretty average we had exit row but felt that seats could have been better bit wider but no real advantage reclining biggest bug bear was poor leg support and table tray far too small also acute lack of storage space on a later flight with another carrier i booked standard economy exit row seat and space much better so premium economy with this carrier for me no way wont do that again not worth the extra money,3
great flight to nagoya international airport and then to okinawa good service great meal and movie entertainment lots of included drinks both non and alcohol as part of the trip able to communicate in english and helpful in providing tickets at one airport for the entire trip it is a long flight but it went very well,5
the er economy is the most spacious economy around at in pitch it was more than adequate for my ft solid frame i was very impressed with every aspect of the flight but cabin service has declined as jal follow the lead of other carriers in utilising nonjapanese staff who do not uphold the once impeccable jal service,5
paid more for the business class and was not disappointed a very pleasant flight the staff were so helpful although the seating was a bit tight to get into i am not your average asian size the comfort was excellent i liked the idea of having your main meal then if you required follow up service you asked so nice not having food pushed upon you great meals i wanted to take the air hostess home to australia we have so much to learn about good service and being nice,5
i would book anytime with this airline especially when travelling with my family a very comfortable flight very accomodating and modern,5
we upgraded to premium economy and it was well worth it because of the length of flight we then were able to use the the jal lounge during our hour layover where there are beds and showers i was able to get a solid hr sleep lying down one of the best airlines weve ever flown sorry to say it really puts us airlines to shame,5
travelled from frankfurt on brand new dreamliner and it was a pleasure plenty of legroom comfortable seats large video in seat with loads of movies etc chargers available in seat food and service excellent thoroughly recommended,5
the aircraft is nice and comfortable japanese food served was delicious i could have eat more the flight was smooth,5
old aircraft you can feel that japanese management is always greedy and controls even how many icecream you are allowed to eat and this is not how a business class should be the food was fine their aircraft had black cotton seats which is fine but i didnt feel very comfortable their business class headsets are plastic and extremely cheap they should get better ones those remind me on economy class however i always take my own tools i use bose or sennheiser and have my own plug,4
my wife recently flew to my homeland japan with my year old son i chose jal bc i believed they would deliver the best service but that couldnt be further from the truth my son ingested too much ice cream and vomited during the flight the airline followed procedure and interviewed my wife about my sons health held them until the plane was empty and then detained them further at the airport we understand the protocol when there is a sickness on board but they treated my family with a cold insensitive disrespect that left my family in tears the treatment jal delivered was completely unacceptable and we will never fly jal nor will be recommend that anyone especially families take this uncaring airlines weve traveled around the world and this flight was the worst experience for us,1
as an one world emerald member i regularly travel with japan airlines this is one of the countless flights i am delighted to have looked after by the jal team the jal business seats are comfortable and provides good rest for long haul flights with all the connectivity you need this is a seat you can sleep in comfortably with a true full flat bed configuration complimentary amenities especially the comfortable cardigan is a nice touch to ensure you are well dressed for your night flights i truly appreciate given a cardigan to which is exceptionally soft and comfortable to help me settle into sleep compared with other leading airlines which do not provide this onboard no disappointment and no unexpected surprises from jal sit back enjoy and relax the warmth and hospitality of jal team,4
ive flown on most of the major carriers jal crew was by far in my top very friendly courteous flight crew check in staff pretty much any employee i talked to regardless of which airport i was at i flew from vancouver narita japan then to hong kong was more than willing to assist very polite id fly jal again for sure the only minor gripe i had would be theres was not wifi in the business class section,5
our group of ages and traveled from boston to ho chi minh city vietnam with a connection in tokyo japan airlines jal was fabulous the monitor in the seat back in front of each passenger was a fabulous option particularly since there were an enormous number of english language choices these included numerous new hollywood movies star wars vii the revenant the big short the hateful eight many others as well as old standby films the original star wars series all men in black films many others there were extensive options for kids as well such as kids tv and movies and video games with a controlled in the armrest the cabin attendants were incredibly pleasant they were available and polite one woman went out of her way to bring me my travel pillow i left it in my seat and she tracked me down all the way in the baggage area about hour after we had departed the plane the food was good the kids meals had an asian focus and were not to our kids tastes but were fine meals we got the vegetarian options which i enjoyed though my wife liked the regular meals my parents had more pasta with meat sauce was one that was really good overall the food was decent i will definitely look to fly jal if we head to asia again or anywhere else jal flies as all six of us had a really positive experience especially given that we were on the plane for hours each way between the two flights,5
confortable seat and lot of place for legs nice flights good food good service and a very comfortable made the journey to paris a pleasure friendly flight attendants generous meals the inflight entertainment definitely has than enough to choose from i watched movies,4
i flew roundtrip singapore to tokyo with experiences to both extremes from singapore to narita tokyo we started off just fine new aircraft with nice seats and good electronic systems the flight attendants were very nice and the food was better than average for an airline all was well until we were diverted to haneda due high winds at narita they made us sit on the runway at haneda for hrs before flying us to narita they had no food and very limited beverage service for the hour delay turning our hr scheduled flight into a hr fiasco upon landing narikta was not prepared for us and all public transportation stops during the night japan airlines did nothing to accommodate their customers even first class customers were stranded at the airport finally at am they handed out a bottle of water and some crackers the trip from haneda tokyo back to singapore was fine in terms of timing but the aircraft was old the seats were worn thin and extremely uncomfortable the electronics were substandard as was the quality of the food drink service was terribly slow and climate control was uncomfortable all in all not a good experience,3
i want readers to fully appreciate this review so i will do my best to pithily and concisely summarize my experience simply put jal is awesome flight attendants are wonderfully attentive helpful and friendly food is decent to tasty and overall experience is quite nice ive flown multiple economy flights and business class flights with jal from the amicable service varies little from business to economy class except economy receives more individualized serviceluxury seat reclines food drink ondemand larger tv screen privacy window etc flying from lax to nrt is not terrible in economy of course business was better but economy was remarkably better than the longhaul with asiana from lax to icn i digress ive flown with jal to japan and to thailand from japan my experience was always pleasant and i wish i flew with jal instead of trying to save money and flying with asiana if it gets down to simply pinching pennies i would still choose jal over other airlines,5
i was surprised on so many levels with jal the staff are extremely polite and courteous and managed to cobble together a meal on an out bound flight when my choice was not available seats are really comfortable entertainment great and punctualin fact i have never been on a flight that boards before the stated time i had flightstwo international and two internal and this applied to all flights the aircraft for the internal flights were brand new and high level service on both flights taken food is good standard and snacks available throughout long haul,5
both ways the flight was perfect the plane is clean the bathrooms are kept immaculate the food is tasty and varied the flight attendants are superbly trained,5
the stewardesses here went out of their way to find me some vegetarian food when they found out that my preorder somehow hadnt gone through i felt it really mattered to them that i had a decent meal and they brought me compensatory bonbons,4
jal offers comfortable flights with good inflight entertainment however jal did not get it right for indian food if you pre book indian meal they offer a very bland sort of thing and i guess their cook has not got it right at all they need to improve a lot on their food front which lacks variety and taste on this front they should learn from emirates or air india,3
ground staff is very niceplanes are super clean the crew is amazing with a good attention to detail super polite and always attentive the food experience is super nice even on this short flight,5
japan airlines might not have fancy suites or showers onboard but their first class product can match any airline firstly the sushi bar at the lounge is really fun and a great way to start the trip i couldnt book a massage though because it was busy and it was a hour wait the food offering in the sakura first class lounge was also fantastic and plentiful for breakfast onboard the semi private suites was very roomy and the seats really comfortable i had the japanese meal from michelin chef seiji yamamoto and it was amazing one course after another each meal tasting like what you would find at a top restaurant in tokyo the crew on my flight were one of the best crews ive ever had on a flight they were so attentive in the middle of the night i was watching a movie and a crew alerted me when the captain spotted the northern lights it is one of the most experiences of my life to see the northern lights feet in the sky just mind blowing wow,5
the flight is comfortable and overnight which makes it even better in flight entertainment is diverse and latest aircraft is well equipped and service top notch,4
round trip flight yvr to mnl via nrt in the air ir was a great flight in business class i was told in yvr my luggage may take a different flight but i will have it the morning after landing next day no contact and after i initiated contact luggage would be delivered later in the day days passed until i saw my belongings again frustrating knowing japanese efficiency i blame the mnl part of jal incompetence for this,3
excellent service friendly and unobtrusively attentive comfortable seats with good legroom im nearly m tall and a wide choice of inflight entertainment options nice choices of food and drinks a more than adequate baggage allowance of two pieces probably the best flight experience ive had in many years will definitely fly with jal whenever possible,5
efficient and good service from the checkin up to arrival great costumer service even to the domestic flights superb inflight meal,4
good service ground staff and flight attendant are very polite helpful and hospitable the aircraft is new and provides good legroom seats are comfortable as well since i dont really enjoy any inflight meals foods served is not bad but the desert ice cream is the best as for the inflight entertainment movies selection is not bad as well but i wish they could add more i hope there are english subtitle to other foreign movies korean movie etc too,4
check in was very efficient had no line to wait in and conducted with gracious service not found with most americanbased airlines as business class passengers we were permitted access to the oneworld lounge in lax which was decently nice the seatpod was more than roomy for me as a petite thin person a very large person might not be very comfortable there was plenty of storage area within the pod and in the overhead bin everything looked clean and sanitary the bathrooms on board were always clean and as a person who absolutely hates these tiny bathrooms and tries not to use them i had no problems using them frequently throughout the flight the amenities were typical and nice eye mask toothbrush slippers etc and the movievideo selections were fairly up to date and varied the dinner service our flight was before noon began within an hour after take off so dont eat too much in the lounge there are both japanese and western selections i chose the western selection which was a filet the two courses that preceded that were delicious but the filet was amazing tender and seasoned nicely wine selections were pretty nice food is unlimited on this flight so after dinner is served one can eat as much as one can tolerate there were snacks of sandwiches pasta ramen tempura and fruitdesserts there was a fantastic coffee mousse dessert that i absolutely loved and asked for a second helping passengers are able to order up until about an hour before landing so one can get a lot of eating in those hours it was hours to tokyo and hours returning to lax the service was impeccable they were very gracious and helpful they never made you feel that you were inconveniencing them or ordering too much food or alcohol they made up our bed when we wanted to sleep and removed them as we prepared to land once everyone had a chance to eat and relax they dimmed the cabin lights and made sleeping very easy with hushed voices and quiet service i cant say enough about the quality of service from all the attendants they try to fulfill your requests and provide items not on the menu or in the amenity bag i had a sore throat and asked for a hard candy the attendant returned with a whole cup of various flavored hard candy and let me know i could get as much as i wanted i have no reservations about recommending this outstanding airline,5
i was pleasantly surprised to find that jal had an updated that had a good interior and ample size ife behind each seat back as a westerner the food was a challenge but nevertheless it was fresh i would recommend flying jal again in the future,5
jal and american express have a companion fare deal that makes it worthwhile to travel in business class at a reasonable price my wife and i flew from ny to bangkok and for hours business was the way to go on this trip service was terrific and the meals were excellent i wouldnt want to travel this route on another airline,4
patient polite comfortable etc etc ontime enjoyed flying this long haul trip saw how they treated some old age passengers and was impressed,5
i needed to fly to beijing at short notice decided to fly jal almost on a whim based on this experience i will fly them again their customer service is nothing short of astounding due to a delay out of honolulu my transit in narita became very short their customer service people escorted me personally and rapidly thru the terminal and security to make sure i made the flight with a minimum of fuss and stress both legs of the flight were really comfortable great service i will fly them again,4
nice flight to tokyo good service at checkin and on the flight it was a smooth flight and a good way to start the trip,5
plane was new seat was great but service is terribly slow on a hour night flight dinner started to be served only two hours after take off and took another hours to finish all this in glaring cabin light which you had to endure regardless whether you gave up eating or not very unflexible crew which was not able to arrang paid upgrades for three collegues,3
my family and i were flying from hong kong to tokyo on jl the first leg of our flight home to vancouver from the moment we walked up to the checkin counter we were greeted with friendly smiles and made to feel very taken care of the flight jl was fantastic our inflight crew was absolutely the best i must however mention i was seated in k and the young lady her name started with a m and is based out of japan who took care of us was positively wonderful with her big smile she constantly made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed we thank you ms m and truly hope to be served by you in the future we cannot wait to fly jal again,5
i just returned from japan today and i had to write about the excellent service we received on japan airlines my husband and i were traveling with our two grown daughters one soninlaw and our three young grandchildren a granddaughter of three and oneandahalfyearold twin boysyikes i was so dreading the long flights but every step of the way from buying tickets to picking up our bags when we got home was a very positive experience they made sure our checkin was as easy as could be we are a tall family but legroom even in economy was fine the seats were comfortable and the food delicious they had very nice meals for the children and a special meal for a vegetarian in our group both flights were right on time and the entertainment offered was great everything is great but the star of the airline is the staff i have never received such pleasant and efficient service while flying even when i have upgraded my seats i am not sure how the flight attendants remain so cheerful on such a long flight they even cleaned the bathrooms during the trip i will certainly put this airline at the top of my list and i will definitely book jal when i am going anywhere they fly,5

japan airlines was great polite attentive flight staff food was good we flew a which seemed brand new it was a good experience,5
i flew japan airlines from kulnrt the nrtord i was amazed even in economy i felt special the flight attendants were very personable it is my favorite airline by far ive traveled on a lot of large airlines and this is the best better than cathay and emirates way to go jal im not easily impresed,5
i am pleased to say i had a relatively pleasant flight journey from london to narita un like most other airlines i had used in the past what pleased me most with this jal flight was the fact that there were enough leg room and seat space for someone like me being over cm who would often be troubled with lack of such space thanks to some fellow passengers in front of me who would decide to recline their seat to a great extent without due care hence i always get nervous for the first quarter of the flight journey in to find out if the passenger in front of me is going to be a mindless moron who would recline the seat straightaway once the seat belt sign is switched off in this flight there was no exception to this however despite the reclined seat in front of me i was not troubled by the lack of space in this flight possibly due to the good seat design devised by jal i still had enough space in front of me and leg room to move about during the whole journey another good thing was i could get some sleep and wake up to the time of destination without much interference from the sun glare or some curious passengers itching to opening up window blinds to peak outside every so often towards the end of the journey in to japan its a good idea that once you had your main meal all the lights were out driving the passengers to believe that its time to take some nap maybe i was fortunate enough to be surrounded by passengers with good common sense and decent social etiquette in this flight alone i managed to have some sleep during a long flight to narita there was a good selection of inflight entertainment programmes and the seat was comfortable enough the only issue i had was to do with the touch screen of the entertainment system its a great idea to have a touch screen panel embedded to the seat but i still prefer the one with remote controller with the touch panel depending on what kind of passenger you get behind your seat if the person happens to be a mindless baboon type who keeps bashing the touch screen not tapping with fingers fists or whatever every time heshe wants to change the channel that would create a nightmareish situation for the poor passenger who is occupying the seat in front of them and it happened to me in this flight i felt my seat was tapped each time this guy behind me kept changing the channel luckily it was just for awhile and most of the passengers were asleep after some hours later i do appreciate jal is trying to keep up with the modern technology and trends however in my view having the latest gadget does not mean its the best for the passengers anyway i would fly with jal again possibly in less busy season,4
because this is a code share with aa jal customers i booked jal specifically do not have the same status as aa passengers and cannot book aisle or window seats online this is a bad deal for jal and as a result makes the flight horrible for jal customers who then will have to sit center seatsmaybe because thier customers do not normally complain this treats jal customers as second class citizens and results in them getting worst seats on the flight i guess this is the last time i will ever fly jal again because you just dont know at time of booking that you will be stuck with middle seats i fly often and just cant deal with center seats so now looking at booking a new ticket on another airline so i do not have to sit middle seathorrible performance jalno wonder you have profitability problems,1
wonderful airline i think they should be rated foodwise very good service is always very polite seats are fairly comfortable and the airplane very clean inflight magazine is aboveaverage i must consider tokyo as my transit destinations and flying japan airlines more often,4
excellent service excellent people we flew with our kids and all staff at the airport and the airplane took very good care of us whatever we requested they were there to help big thank to all of you,5
we had a very uneventful flight which is great it left on time the crew is so friendly bathrooms were clean the entire flight we had lay flat seats with the biggest tv screens ive seen on a business class seat the plane was very very warm during the night flight,4
i flew nyc to tokyo then onto singapore jal definitely made the hours traveling lot easier and then we flew back with them two months later from singapore to nyc and guess what their service did not change way to go jal in staying constant with your exquisite customer service and comfort,5
food was very good and the flight attendants were very courteous and hospitable the seats were very comfortable with lots of legroom the inflight entertainment was up to date and working unlike the broken wifi problems united has been having would definitely recommend this airline,5
jal st double decker airline amazed by the customer service requested for vegan food and window seat at the time of check in and booking airlines called up twice did a followup to check if vegan with tofu is fine,5
fantastic service with helpful classy onboard crew great food served so nicely typical of japanese hospitality very clean aircraft for the whole hour trip even toilets have to say we had a wonderful boeing topnotch it made a very long trip more comfortable,5
jal will always take care of you their flight attendants are amongst the most attentive in the world and their first class cabin is one of the best the seat turns into a true bed with a mattress fantastic only thing is that i wish they had a better snacksmall meal selection since full meals are pretty meaningless on this overnight flight,5
talk about an amazing airline we flew from los angeles to osaka last year and the experience was great the seats were comfortable the food was tasty and the entertainment was topnotch all the recent movies that we hadnt seen in theaters was available on this airline they also gave us plenty of free beer will definitely be flying with them again,5
ultra polite and helpful cabin crew tasty food on board as well as the quick snacks which are available at any time throughout the flight udon cake etc the jal sakura lounge at haneda airport is also exceptional comfortable an excellent selection of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages hot and cold foods and other helpful amenities such as showers and lockers,5
seat was about as comfortable as it gets in economy and the incredible service made the flight fly by like a pleasure the freeflowing plum wine definitely helps too,5
very disappointed in their confusion about a code share flight with cathay pacific impossible to resolve with cathay on return could not reach jal after their working hours but cathay has hour phone number but could not handle change of return flight date because the code share was only outbound from japan this is the third time i have used jal in the past months and i used to think it was a superb airline but now i am quite inconvenienced and do not want to do business with them or cathay if i can avoid doing so,2
we flew japan airline from jfk to kaohsiung taiwan and back and had a really good experience with the airline we booked economy flights and at first did not realize we would not be able to select seats until hours before the flight we were really nervous about not being able to sit togetherwe are a family of but had no problem on all flights getting seats together the service on the flight was exceptional the food was really good and the entertainment was good too the seats were comfortable our only complaint was the heatall four flights were extremely hotso just dress in layers so you can take off layers when the heat rises we were extremely happy with japan airlines and would not hesitate to fly with them again,5
it was service with a smile from the moment we checked in at the airport the cabin crew warmly welcomed us and helped us with our hand carry luggage being a tall person even the leg space in the economy seat was spacious enough to accommodate me i checked in my wheelchair at the boarding gate and transferred to a cabin chair it was waiting for me the moment i got out from the aircraft in the hour flight i had to go to the toilet at least once i informed a cabin of this and he said to call them when i needed to go two cabin crew attended to me one to push the cabin chair and the other to make sure we didnt roll over another passengers foot in the semidarkness and narrow aisle the toilet at the tail end of the aircraft was rather small but i just needed some privacy to perform intermittent catheterisation without having to sit on the toilet bowl the space outside the toilet leading to the passenger cabin could be locked while the cabin crew pulled the curtains at the other end this created a rather spacious area or me to empty my bladder the overall experience for flying with this airline as a wheelchair user was positive the service on the return flight was similarly helpful and courteous,5
recently went to japan to visit family upon the death of a relative going to tokyo the plane was a bit older but clean and the food was edible the staff was very friendly and came around constantly to check if anyone needed something however coming back the staff was friendly but it seemed forced the food was horrendous the first meal we had a choice but neither was edible the second meal there was no choice it was some supposedly special noodles with sauce this had no taste at all fortunately i was exhausted and slept a lot my one plus to this return trip was how the stewardesses took care of a family with a crying baby i have done that before and it is very stressful they were kind and helpful to the parents,3
very nice airline clean everything was sealed before use food were very good healthy and you can choose japanese entree or american food haagendazs ice cream generous beverages green tea juice winesaki most of all we love our own small but individual tv screen so we can watch different movie or channel we wanted flight attendants were also very sweet i saw one of them holding the baby for a mother on board one of bathroom is also larger than american or united that we have flew before,5
the flight attendants are nice and polite they smile all the timethe cabin is a little old and lousy though,5
this was a comfortable flight the business class has individual cubicles so no one is crawling over you to use the bathroom the crew is first class friendly and helpful the plane leaves around am and the meal is a light evening snack if i am awake at i am still hungry you can order sandwiches at any time which i did every two hours when i woke up they were very good i enjoyed the flight and slept most of the way,4
extraordinary service airline staff from checkin to staff to flight crew the flight crew had smiles from beginning to end of my flight i say japan airlines is one of the best airlines to fly on,5
being meters tall i asked jal call center to assign me a seat with leg space even the supervisor was not able to assist with this simple request other airlines have no problem with doing this the supervisor was not flexible at all this left me very frustrated and stressed about my long flight to india however the staff and the supervisor at the airports both in japan and in india were far more accommodating they were kind they listened and they were able to help me with my request for a seat with leg space the actual flight the service on board inflight entertainment and the food were all good i would fly with them again if the call center staff were a little more flexible and caring and understanding,3
i was lucky enough to find people working for japan airline when i go lost into the airport in chicago trying to find my flight customer service is amazing it was a very nice flying experience it was my first trip oversea and i didnt regret it if you have to take a flight to asia going with japan airline is the best way to go,5
the crew is cheerful polite and keeps smile the food is so standard for muslim snack but the meal is ok the cabin is moderate with configuration for economic class have bigger restroom at left behind aircraft free flow of water orange juice etc,4
a somewhat disappointing inflight experience with jal on this overnight service to sydney cabin lights were left on at full brightness for well over hours sure the dinner service needed to be completed but the harshness intensity of the lighting was about as comfortable as a hospital emergency waiting room i asked if the lighting could be dimmed even slightly to no avail little surprise the foot rests were troublesome locking in a half way down position unless forcibly reset by hand to the max up position cabin crew were courteous helpful as ever,3
jal is my goto air line i always loved jal for their professional attitude im not just talking about their cabin crew but their ground crew have great customer service skills also last year when i needed assistance with reservation for trip to japan from dfw for my fathers funeral they helped me through it despite the international part of the whole trip was not jals flight they treated me with very kind and caring words and helped me with each steps to ensure ill be there for my fathers service jal will be always my first choice and ill recommend jal to everybody,5
this was my first time flying with japan airlines and i must say it did not disappoint the attendants were attentive kind and made sure that you were comfortable and taken care of i have never seen such attention to detail on any other flight when they noticed my wine bottle was empty the attendant quickly replaced it with no questions asked the food was interesting there was one dish with ham a sweet sauce and walnuts that tasted odd but apart from that everything else was delicious,5
jal has always fantastic reviews by many people from different cultures i like jal overall except for premium economy class i chosen from los angeles to narita japan get to the point issue was reclining seat seat does not recline at all instead seat roll down toward forward despite of you get more leg room than economy class when seat roll down forward you loose leg room tremendously i did not like that when seat roll down forward you dont recline your back your entire body roll down forward just like seat it was very uncomfortable premium economy seat cost me near us believe in me if your budget is around us and need more comfort on your seat and around you take singapore air premium economy their seats actually recline comfortably you also get choose meal from selections when you purchase a ticket their entertainment program is far better than jal so for near hours flight go for singapore air you wont regret it,2
very efficient and comfortable delightful service and generally good food business class seats were comfortable although did not go flat on the outward journey the code share flight with american airlines was not as good as jal,5
i began using jal a couple of years ago when they started offering a flight into hnd arriving and departing at very convenient times their business class product is of very high quality all seats offer good privacy and most important aisle access without the need to climb over someones legs furthermore this allows staff to serve you directly ie if you have an aisle seat they do not need to lean over you this makes the whole service a very smooth and pleasant experience talking of service very friendly and swift amongst the better ones you experience when travelling in c the seats offer a full flatbed and an aircushion is provided for additional comfort i always have had very good sleep in these seats lavatories are up to japanese standards which is pretty unique in air travel western food options are a bit of a mixed bag but still good the wash bags look very impressive tumi but the contents are spartanic eg no moisturizer and socks but a sweater is on offer if you want to get out of your shirt large movie screens i think it was the largest in c when launched i noticed there are more crew announcements than on other airlines which can be a bit annoying as the entertainment system stops nevertheless when given a choice i prefer jal over other carriers on most occasions and the jal lounges are very impressive too,4
truly one of the best airlines the seats in economy class are really spaciius the aircraft though old is well maintained the avod screen is huge the selections are really entertaining the service by the crew is really impeccable,5
i traveled from new delhi to tokyo and back after my first experience they have reached to the top spot in my preferred airlines the flight crew is very service oriented they take very good care of the passengers food and drinks are good and many options are available in flight entertainment is excellent most importantly they have a very good sense of time for business travellers this is one of the most important factor highly recommended,5
very nice drink the meal came with a hot soup rice crackers and a haagen daaz ice cream for dessert for my beverage i selected jal skytime which is a yuzu citrus flavored drink im a sky time fanatic and its pretty much the only beverage i order when im on a jl flight other than green tea,5
everything about the flight was impressive the food the service and the comfort of the cabin but perhaps the most impressive was the cabin staff regrettably we were forced to disembark from our plain before it had taken off due to some technical problem the staff were so apologetic that they seemed close to tears of humiliation to make up for the inconvenience while we waited for another plane to be made available the staff handed out food vouchers of yen so that everyone could have a meal in the airport while we waited it was a very generous and welcome gesture and by the time we had eaten the plane was ready to board there is much that airlines in other parts of the world could learn from this great example of customer service this could have been a customer complaint nightmare for them instead it became a plus point,5
the service is good with some air hostesses the experience was quite good they were quite hospitable food quality is good cleanliness is also upto the mark the seating comfort however needs improvement for long flights it becomes taxing,4
very good leg room i know this matters most for many crew is very hospitable and friendly as i arrived early they put me on a earlier flight for free from tokyo to osaka my final destination wo a request,5
perhaps i have high expectation with the jl inflight meal i had a beef pattie with rice and it was just soso the kiwi juice was good though,4
i had ordered the low sodium meal and the flight attendant confirmed this before the flight even closed the door the toilet was spacious i was amazed at how much extra room there was at one point one passenger told me one of the stalls was dirty and let a flight attendant know the flight attendant told her it will be cleaned and immediately started to do so dinner and breakfast was served and in between there was a häagendazs vanilla ice cream offered as a snack the overhead bins are small its not one long bin shared by a couple of rows but for one row only i had a poster which didnt fit so my boss had the cabin crew stow it elsewhere,5
this was the first time i flow with first class way beyond my expectation serve the delicate oolong tea champagne after seated then hand over the right size of pajama then my star japanese style meal started for the hour flight i enjoy every minute in the air did not even want to go to sleep i watched movies and drank unlimited high quality tea and numerous star chief unforgettable dishes it was a flawless flight from the beginning to the end would like to fly again even have to fly from vegas to chicago in order to take this flight thats how much i love this airline and this route to japan,5
i was flown from manila to narita round trip on november the flight time is hours they served us one meal that has only one menu for everybody the food was just fine mixed japanese and western food the seat is ok good space between front and back row they have not much movies in the entertainment system and the personal tv is so small overall service is good,4
pleasant service on this flight the snacks were not as good as you would expect on a japanese flight but still a comfortable flight,4
customer service was simply elegant and genuine the flight attendants were in constant motion there was always one flight attendant walking around to ensure safety and to provide service this is my second time on jal and i must say i am truly impress the delivery of customer service was consistent throughout the entire hr flight from the moment you embark on the plane you are greeted and welcomed by a courteous smile all the flight attendants ensured that if assistance was needed they were prompt in addressing the request and smiled the entire time this is the kind of service that would make a return customer and loyal frequent flyer,4
we were very impress with the level service of this air line from the time we checked in to on board their personel always have the smile on their face their professonialism is second to none we can feel how serious and how proud they are to provide service for their customers we all agreed that the way they handle themself seem like they appriciate the job they have the plane is clean both international and domestic the seats are comfortable and the food is pretty good their entertainment system is outstanding a lot of movies also include some new release we all agreed this is the best airline we have been traveled thank you for made our fly enjoyable,5
jal can be highly recommended service was excellent from start of flight to the finish the stewardess were professional and warm food on board was excellent i chose the japanese option delicious and fresh ingredients were used flat bed was comfortable and the equipment on board user friendly i would definitely fly jal again,5
my family were all impressed with the quality comfort food entertainment and service on japan airlines we flew from tokyo to london on dec and were fortunate to have a quiet flight with a fair nnumber of empty seats however the flight from vancouver to tokyo was full and it was equally as good having been on a round the world ticket with one world on number of airlines this airline was the top performer the seats were slightly more roomy and longer the service was far superior ie how quickly drinks were offered hot towels etc and the bathrooms were very clean throughout the flighti would most definately fly with japan airlines again in the future,5
travelled on this airline for the first time recently and was very pleased i did the seats were very comfortable for a long haul flight the inflight service was very attentive and courteous without being over the top food was average and i have had much better on other premium airlines the flights departed and arrived on time the in flight entertainment was ok although i have had better on other airlines the inch tv screen was excellent though the noise cancelling headphones were very good as was the ability to charge my phone and tablet in flight this enabled me to play games on my own device without running down the battery would definitely travel with them again,4
we have flown this airline many times to different places there arent many ways airlines can differentiate themselves but jal really tried hard their flights are usually on time and when they are late it usually isnt by more than a few minutes their inflight staff is the most courteous we have experienced they know when to check in and when to leave you alone their bathrooms are larger than most airlines their legroom tends to be larger their seats are quite comfortable only caveat here is that lumbar support isnt great they have more inflight meal selections than any other airline we have experienced but to take full advantage of that definitely call a few days before your flight their inflight entertainment system is the best weve seen with a wide selection of movies and shows which you can watch on demand,5
i really enjoy myself with this airline the food served was really delicious besides i was impressed with the service and cleanliness of the airplane highly recommended for those who wants to go to japan,5
was pleasantly surprised by the economy class experience by jal from seoul to tokyo the leg space was comfortable service efficient and good inflight entertainment i did not expect such an experience for a cheap ticket bought through a travel website,4
i accidentally got a great ticket deal from expedia and it was an impressive experience i was impressed by the cleanliness and service there were always smiles on the fight attendants faces and they never hesitated to help they served tasty food and drinks the on board entertainment was great with old and new movies and music the plane itself was very clean and i didnt feel uncomfortable at all even though i was in economy class highly recommended,5
it was my first time with this airline and my first flight was great and the second one the hour one was even better they give meals plus snacks as well as several snacks at the back of the plane that you can get yourself it mentions wifi when i fill out this review but i was not aware if there was or not the flight attendants were very friendly and very patient the japanese are so zen and made the flights easier they were always available the longer flight had blankets and u shaped pillows which actually are comfy to sleep,5
after a long layover while i tried to sleep in kennedy airport japan airlines opened its ticketing area for boarding passes around with a welcome and a bow to us it was uphill from there because the service was great they had about six stewards in economy they were all polite and helpful we had two full meals on the hour flight plus two snacks one meal was dinner and the other was lunch dinner included pork with vegetables and rice miso soup salmon over potato salad green salad fruit and picked vegetables i certainly did not lack for food oh and the beer was free that helped me sleep the was comfortable with a usb plug large screen tv in the seat back and they even provided slippers and neck pillows the u kind for your comfort three seats next to me were empty so i lazily stretched out to sleep when i got up and was thirsty i walked to the back and found a steward eating i apologized for interrupting him and he graciously offered me apple juice instead of water which was great,5
the best airline and service ive seen in a long time really nice seat and lots of place best food and service the staff is so attentive to your demand wow,5
service on board was fantastic flight attendants never showed any impatience or rude behavior they were always polite i get the sense that some of the flight attendants dont have a great grasp of english so i wasnt sure if they really understood what i said but it was never an issue the first part of my flight from yvr to nrt was on business class the plane did not have st class which i think is nicer because there were more business seat options this flight used shell flat neo which is not completely flat but at an angle this leg was a longer flight about hours so we had additional meal as compared ot leg i had thought the seat would not be as good as leg but actually this seat was very comfortable i give it a out of minus for not fully flat and minus because it never seemed to give me an ideal length for my legs and im not that tall leg was sky suites ii which gave you a lot more storage areas but felt smaller even though it really wasnt overall great food choices and snacks and the anytime food selection is a great idea movie options i thought was just ok the fact that it was the same options on my return flight was a bummer as i had already watched everything i wanted to see most movies were not really recent i think my biggest negative would have to be the lounge in vancouver you use a shared lounge with other airlines premium plaza lounge it got very crowded i think some of the folks in that lounge hadnt eaten in days because they were rushing the lines and ate plates of stuff before i finished having my cup of tea so trying to get food was a battle i was disappointed in the sakura lounge however as that is their main lounge there is the main sakura lounge and smaller sakura lounge i used both and had issues with both in both cases they made announcements about the lounge being at capacity and it felt like it however in the main lounge there was plenty of room but they separated their dining area to an area where you need to walk up so you had to eat in that dining area which was very small if the food was in the main lounge area there wouldnt be such a sea of humanity clustered together i opted not to have any kind of food in either lounge because of the crowds and because the food didnt look very good the lounge at singapore was also a shared lounge and the food there was also mediocre jals biggest negative for me was their website its not very well done and the check in process is not well thought out they ask for a lot of information including your passport info which i had already previously provided when you are on the road more than likely you are on slow hotel wifi their check in page asked for too much and not user friendly additionally they expect you to check in each segment separately they also dont provide you with electronic boarding pass thats bad if you are connecting to their flight if you were connecting without a boarding pass you likely will have to go to the main departure terminal and redo security because inside a terminal youre not likely to find someone who can print the boarding pass for you this will vary from airport to airport,4
