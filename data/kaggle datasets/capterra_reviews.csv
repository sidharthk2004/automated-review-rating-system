Zoho Desk,Zoho desk is a go!,"Pros:Email management, this was the whole reason the company I work for got Zoho desk. We have been using just a normal email provider and it made it hard for us to maintain accountability if a colleague did not sign the email with their name. Zoho desk made it easy to make sure the workload was evenly assigned and provided us with the ability to maintain accountability when errors were made with customer responses. When new emails came in it would assign it to whoever was working emails for that time being, if the person who got assigned the emails wasn't able to respond with or know the answer to the question the customer was asking it would be easy for them to reassign the emails to somebody else that would be able to respond correctly. The integration of Zoho desk was easy it didn't take us long to get the hang of it.","Cons:The one thing I least like about the whole task was the ability to merge tickets. We weren't able to really merge them as quickly and easily as we thought we would be able to, even though this might have been due to our Administration disabling the ability for us to do so, it would be nice if that option was just kept open.",Switched From:Gmail,4,3,5,5,,5,-1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The most feature I like is the organization of tickets and your ability to correct AI responses. You will be able to review chats at a later time and you can reach out to customers using ZOho Desk if you need to and that for sure is really needed especially to customers whom you think did not get the right answer to their queries from your AI responses.Try and thank me later.","There is only 1 thing I did not like about Zoho desk. While the main thing I like the most is the ability to respond or reach out to clients at a later time when you think the customer did not get the answer they wanted, Zoho desk allows customers to input a fake email, this will make you not be able to respond at a later time because your message will not get through their inbox.

The built-in reporting features allow us to easily customize reports the way we want, giving us excellent business insights.","The reporting feature is very good. Similarly, the ability to create custom views in our module log gave us greater insight into key data stored in Zoho Desk. Integration with other Zoho applications is critical for us, and Zoho Desk acts as a hub for project tracking, communication and task tracking for our team. Most, if not all other Zoho applications are natively integrated with Zoho Desk. Zoho Desk is highly customizable. Zoho Desk is a must-have for anyone using the rest of the Zoho Desk platform. In addition, it acts as a tightly integrated hub with other Zoho applications. Making it the only Zoho application where our project users can log in to check emails, tasks, deal status, etc. on a daily basis. As administrators, it is critical that we optimize the way we configure Zoho Desk to provide the most useful information to our users while requiring the least amount of data entry from them.","Honestly, I can't say anything negative about Zoho Desk. One last thing to add is that Zoho Desk has so many features that it is difficult to configure each one to optimize our team's success. It is important to use the features that best reflect our company's internal processes. Integrate with Zoho Social or other social networking tools. This may be due to my lack of effort to make better use of this existing functionality.

The site is responsive, and I haven't encountered any major bugs.","Zoho Desk acts normal when a user submits a ticket via email, but when I have to make one myself it starts acting somewhat strange. First, you need a contact assigned to the ticket. Reasonable enough, but the contact list is always empty. However, entering the user's email address will produce a prompt stating that there's already a contact with that address. Auto-filling a user's info this way is (as far as I know) the only way to properly assign a ticket to a user in Zoho Desk.Once the ticket's created, there's no way to tell if it was made by the help desk or if it was submitted by the user. Since most of our tickets are submitted, this can result in some confusion when I have to make one myself and my co-worker assumes that the user wrote it.Lastly, settings can be a bit confusing to navigate.

Also having to bump up to the highest tier plan just to be able to integrate with all of the Zoho services we utilize was a bit frustrating.

It would take me an hour to list them all. However, it's usable, so it's not completely junk. Some tasters of what's wrong with it include the fact that email templates are not unified. You have to edit each of them one by one, and if you want to change the sender address, you need to open each template and save it. If you save ten in a row too quickly, then you need to wait for their system to stop blocking your requests because their throttling mechanism will nab you.Another is that when you go to add a new agent, you fill out the form and THEN it asks you to upgrade your package. Sometimes the subscription upgrade page won't open. A better way to make it work is to replace the Add Agent button with a button to quickly add a new seat to your plan at the click of a button and then let you add an agent. They'll get money much faster that way, too.If you delete an agent to replace one, you need to reassign all of your tickets, even if the tickets need to be assigned to the new agent.

Zoho Desk,A reasonable choice for ticket management,"I have en evaluating Zoho Desk - I'm a longtime user of Teamwork Desk, so my experience is weighed against that platform. I have been pleasantly surprised by a few things in Zoho Desk up to now - customer assignment from forwarded email tickets works very well. I like the ability to make light agents which essentially is a free user account for staff that might need to be consulted on an issue. Lowers the overall number or user licenses. I'd love to be able to integrate CRM data, but we don't use ZOHO CRM, so that will take custom coding. I wish there was integration with Zoho Projects, which seems to make sense. I don't use this product to support software development, or physical product support. Zoho Desk is fully featured to support those things, and that makes setup a little complex - there's a pretty high configuration learning curve and the documentation is not terribly clear in all instances. Phone/email/chat support however, has been EXCELLENT. I realize not all have had the same experience, YMMV, as they say. One more positive comment - the ability to quickly visualize particular agents queues, move things around using the various views, and the threaded way of displaying the ticket activity chain is quite nice. So far, I think the transition to Zoho will be a positive thing. It's definitely work a look.",Reporting is strong - ability to consolidate all channels is also very helpful.,Setup learning curve is steep - especially if you have not set up a ticketing system before.,4,3,5,4,3,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,1

With so many tickets, we quickly outgrew Jira, which caused it to break often and make its interface cumbersome. After years of problems, we finally made the transfer to Freshdesk. When compared to Jira's pricing and functionality, it's hard to top this deal. Since we'd lost our previous wiki and needed to start again, we used Jira's streamlined setup process to create a new one. It's a combination of the help desk's ticketing system, online chat, email, and a comprehensive knowledge library.","There is nothing I dislike about Freshdesk.

If you have one off emails that you'll never need to see again once resolved, maybe.If it weren't for the fact we have so many existing records with this company we'd switch but we are stuck, and years of asking them for a simple feature to either allow date based searches OR at least display actual date of email, has been futile. Regret having chose this as our support desk provider for our team of 8!","The lack of basic and very simple features such as filtering emails/communication by date, or even displaying an accurate date.

Freshdesk,FreshDesk Review,"My overall experience with Freshdesk has been great. The platform is easy to use and navigate, and provides great customer service and support. The ticketing system is very organized and efficient and the dashboard is great for keeping track of all your customer support requests. The automation and reporting tools help to streamline the process and make it easier to manage multiple customers. The integration with other tools is also helpful, allowing me to quickly connect with other systems to provide better customer service. Overall, I find Freshdesk to be a great platform for managing customer service requests.","I liked how easy it was to use Freshdesk. The software was intuitive, and the user interface was well designed. The customer support was also excellent. They were always available to answer questions and provide assistance. Additionally, the reporting features were comprehensive and allowed us to track customer support trends and metrics.","One of the biggest drawbacks of freshdesk is its lack of customizability. It can be difficult to tailor the software to meet the specific needs of different businesses, as there are limited options for customizing the interface and features. Additionally, the pricing plans can be a bit expensive for some companies, depending on the level of support they require.",4,3,4,4,4,7,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0
Freshdesk,It has many functions like ticket management,"Intuitive interface that can greatly aid businesses in providing superior customer service. It supports a plethora of functions, such as ticket tracking, sales funnel management, task tracking, service history, etc. Tracking and responding to tickets is simple. In addition, it has numerous tools for reporting and analysis.","Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) stand to gain a lot from using Freshdesk. If you ever have a problem, their customer service is top notch. All in all, we were pleased with Freshdesk during our time working with them. Our primary motivation for using the ticketing system was for support purposes.","Occasionally, it might be a difficult process to integrate the new system with the old one, and some functions, like ticket forms, have relatively less room for personalization.

Freshdesk,Far better than the rest!,"I have tried and worked with various competing helpdesk software's (both SaaS and Self Hosted), but Freshdesk is simply amazing and outstanding.I was up and running in less than 2-3 minutes. Yes, you heard it right, less than 2-3 minutes.","The best part I love about Freshdesk is the super fast - clean, simple, minimalistic and easy-to-use interface.Next what impresses me is the instant help and tips across all the sections in the Admin, making it extremely easy for a layman to get started in less time and without any help and support.","Well, there is really nothing I don't like about Freshdesk other than a little improvement with spam handling and spammers. No doubt Freshdesk already takes care of it but slightly in a different manner.I feel there should be an intelligent spam detection algorithm and mechanism which would send the spam tickets right into the Spam folder. Besides, creating and maintaining a common database of spammers would add even more charm to the software.That way, an agent can further manually review the Spam tickets and deal with them accordingly.Another slight issue is with the contact management. For any contacts that are deleted, Freshdesk marks tickets from those contacts as spam which I think is wrong. From time-to-time, the contact database increases with people contacting only once and then never turning back for years. Such contacts unnecessarily increase the burden of managing contacts and need to be deleted periodically.Instead, Freshdesk should consider creating a special category wherein all the contacts that are marked as spam will be tagged into this category.That way, an agent can get rid of unwanted contacts.",5,5,5,5,,10,1,0,1,0,1,1,-1,0,0,0
Freshdesk,Great for Support Tasks,"Overall, FD is a helpful tool for a support staff that deals with a large client base.However, just like any other product, it does have some things that need to be worked on.","It's easy to categorize and keep track of your work, especially with the new FreshDesk Mint version.The new FreshDesk Mint also shows a contact's recent tickets, so I can quickly see their recent history.I really love the scenario automations and keyboard shortcuts.Overall, FD mint feels smoother than the old FD.I wish they had:-more options for scenario customization-more options for keyboard shortcuts/customization===They have a decent customer support team that responds relatively quick(within 24 hours).","Some features from the old FreshDesk didn't transfer to the new FreshDesk mint.-Text in <PRE> tags wrapped perfectly to the next line(s) on the old FD, but it gets jumbled into one line on the new FD mint.I have to literally copy the whole string and create a comment so I can read my client's request.-I was able to edit the ticket's requester email address to ANY mail address on the old FD. This is not possible on the FD mint unless you have admin privileges to edit your company's contact database. So, if you don't have admin privileges to edit your company's contact database, you'd only have access to update the ticket request email address to ONLY contacts in your company's contact database.I had to literally convert to the old FD every time to just update the email address, and then go back to FD mint to process the rest of the ticket. -CTRL+Shift shortcut didn't enter a space on the old FD, but it does on the new FD Mint.I have to account for this now whenever working in FD Mint.-Better statistics and analysis would be nice.The most useless statistic/achievement they offer is the 'Speed racer' statistic.I believe it's fair to help contacts in the order they come(first come, first serve).So, I work on 'older' tickets and I get punished for not responding to the 'newest' ticket available.Why should you serve the client that just walked in the door instead of the person who has been waiting for hours?",4,4,5,4,,8,1,-1,1,0,0,0,1,0,-1,0
Freshdesk,A Fresh Approach to Ticketing,"FreshDesk is a great ticketing system. We use FreshDesk to support all the schools in our school district.Integration with Google (SSO, profile info, etc) works wonderfully. Knowledge base Articles are great. If we had to do it all over again, we would pick FreshDesk again.Our users love FreshDesk, they often comment how easy it is to place a ticket.","Modern, Elegant, Google Integrated,Nice iOS & Android Apps, Intuitive. Lots of useful features. (Merging tickets, Splitting tickets, Tags for tickets, KB Articles, Teams, Chat, etc) Nifty videos even at the end of the year. Service up-time is great (I don't think we've ever noticed an outage). Knowledge base Articles are great.","Plans & pricing are a bit annoying. You have to pick from useful features or unnecessary cost for things that should be included without an up charge to a higher plan.Sales, Support, Development, Billing, basically EVERYTHING, is in India, which isn't by itself bad, and for Freshdesk's part, it's much better than most India based support... But, if you open a ticket about billing, it can be months (literally months) before your issue is resolved.There are some design flaws with the product, and while you're told changes will be considered, they seldom are - FreshDesk has their own agenda, and your feedback isn't all that important in the development. It would be nice to see the company track, implement, and report back when feedback is actually taken, and this would be nice if it was done in a timely manner, but that doesn't happen.Some features are a bit confusing to set up and have silly names (Observer & Dispatcher) -- an outside has no idea what those features do, and even after using FreshDesk for a years, it's still a bit opaque.The concept of ticket fields vs user fields can be a bit annoying.There are little refinements that are lacking (email alerts that are not as good as they should be, etc).",5,5,5,5,5,9,1,0,0,-1,1,1,0,-1,0,1

We asked them for their feedback. They told us that they were happy with the solution and it matched their requirements, even with the Free edition. In 2015, we were looking for a helpdesk platform, because our internal solution was outdated and our budget was tight. We look at the solutions available on the market. After a very quick try we were convinced about Freshdesk: it was adopted! The Free edition (Sprout) offered us everything we needed and it was so user friendly!Freshdesk helps us to save time and money as it automates the support ticket management process: customized support rules, automatic email notification, tickets queue management That's perfect for us and for our customers who use it for submitting support ticket.","We definitively like a couple of things about Freshdesk. Even with the Free edition you have access to plenty of features. The portal can be customized: you can specify the colors of the colors theme, choose a font and also add your organization logo. You then can offer a branded helpdesk platform to your customers. All the admin features you need are in a one tab (Admin) organized in 4 main categories: helpdesk channels, main settings It is so easy to configure the solution and to customize it (forms, emails, and so on). The solution can be online in only a couple of minutes.We had to contact the Freshdesk support only once, and honestly we were really impressed by the way they handled our support request because we only have the free edition.

Freshdesk,"Quite powerful CRM for Email Management, but still Improving","Overall, the system is quite good, but there is definitely room for improvement. It's generally easy to use for the basic actions and the rules that can be set make this a powerful tool.It does begin to get a little complicated when you have several departments using Freshdesk together (for example, adding another department using Freshdesk into a ticket doesn't create a ticket for that department - instead, the ticket has to be flipped, or have to go through parent-child ticketing, which can be confusing for those that are not tech savvy).","Freshdesk allows our company to manage our distribution lists that have a very high volume of incoming emails. It allows management to distribute and balance the workload of the department with ease.Not only does it keep a record of all emails sent and received, it also keeps track of all actions that were taken within the ticket along with the users or rules responsible for the changes.","The way the tickets come in and starts tracking time - this should be modifiable based on business needs, but seems to only track the time (& SLA) based on when the ticket/ email was created. This would be great for an IT department, but loses it's value in this aspect for a Customer Service department.Other companies that use a ticketing based CRM tends to clash with Freshdesk sometimes. Since each response includes the ticket number at the end of the subject line, each response ends up creating a brand new ticket, making it much harder to follow the chain.Freshdesk also has a Merge feature - but this feature doesn't really work very well. I would recommend not using it at all if the email chains are large. This feature just sticks the entire email chain into the ticket, as a single post, instead of filling in spots in chronological order.",4,5,4,4,,7,-1,0,0,-1,1,0,1,0,0,0

Having deep experience with Salesforce, we can say that Freshdesk has VERY LOW options of customization.

Shutting down system (Hotline) and forcing users to move to another solution (throwing out all works done about implementation of Hotline)4.

Freshdesk,Ottima soluzione per la gestione del supporto clienti,"Pros:Una delle caratteristiche principali che mi ha colpito di Freshdesk è la sua facilità d'uso. La configurazione iniziale è stata rapida e senza problemi, e il dashboard è intuitivo, il che ha permesso al mio team di iniziare a utilizzare la piattaforma in pochissimo tempo. La possibilità di personalizzare il sistema secondo le nostre esigenze è stata molto utile, consentendoci di creare flussi di lavoro personalizzati e regole per l'instradamento dei ticket.La gestione dei ticket è molto efficiente con Freshdesk. È possibile assegnare ticket a membri specifici del team, impostare scadenze e monitorare lo stato dei ticket in tempo reale. Inoltre, l'integrazione con il nostro sistema di posta elettronica è stata fluida, consentendo di avere tutti i messaggi dei clienti in un'unica posizione.Il portale self-service è un grande vantaggio, poiché consente ai nostri clienti di trovare risposte alle loro domande senza dover contattare direttamente il supporto. Questo ha ridotto il carico di lavoro del nostro team e ha migliorato l'esperienza del cliente.","Cons:Ho notato che alcune delle funzioni avanzate richiedono un abbonamento a pagamento, il che potrebbe non essere adatto per tutte le piccole imprese con budget limitati. Inoltre, l'assistenza clienti di Freshdesk potrebbe essere migliorata, poiché a volte le risposte ai nostri ticket di supporto richiedevano più tempo del previsto.In sintesi, Freshdesk è una soluzione eccellente per la gestione del supporto clienti con molte funzionalità utili per migliorare l'efficienza operativa. Tuttavia, è importante valutare il costo delle funzionalità avanzate e prendere in considerazione l'assistenza clienti prima di scegliere questa piattaforma.

With the introduction of ChatGPT I hope to see more automated tasks. Also the addition of tags as another form of chat categorization will help as the Labels provide a more general placement into a category and the tabs will really help define every chat issue.,Alternatives Considered:Zendesk Suite,5,5,4,4,5,10,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,-1
Freshdesk,Improve Your Customer Service Using Freshdesk,One of my favorite features of Freshdesk is the wide variety of tools available for providing excellent customer service. The ticketing system is one of many notable features since it efficiently organizes consumer inquiries and guarantees that none are overlooked.,"Our support staff can now respond to client questions quickly and effectively. The user-friendliness of the interface facilitates quick responses from agents to consumers. Our customer service processes are now more streamlined, our response times are faster, and our customers are happier as a result.","Freshdesk has many features, however it might be better in a few key areas.

The interface is clean, intuitive, and well-organized, making it a breeze for our team to navigate and access the various features. It didn't take long for everyone to get the hang of it, even new team members found it user-friendly.One of the standout features that had a significant impact on our customer support operations is the robust ticket management system. It allows us to effectively track, categorize, and prioritize customer inquiries. With automation and workflow rules, we were able to streamline our processes and ensure that tickets are assigned to the right team members promptly. This helped us prevent any tickets from slipping through the cracks and improved overall customer satisfaction.Another aspect that impressed us was Freshdesk's ability to provide multichannel support.

Although Freshdesk provides some reporting capabilities and customizable dashboards, we found that the options for advanced analytics and customization were somewhat limited. We would love to have more in-depth insights into our support performance and the ability to create more tailored reports.Another area where we felt Freshdesk could improve is in social media integration. While it supports social media channels for customer communication, we found that the integration with social media platforms could be more robust. Having more advanced social media monitoring and engagement features within the software would help us effectively manage and respond to customer inquiries on those channels.Additionally, we encountered a few challenges when it came to configuring certain settings and workflow rules in Freshdesk. Some of the more advanced configuration options required a bit of trial and error to set up correctly. It would be beneficial if Freshdesk provided more intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for these advanced settings to simplify the configuration process, especially for non-technical users.",4,5,5,4,4,9,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1

Ability to delete certain Tickets that are not useful to a User,"I wish Freshdesk ca improve in the following:1. The maximum amount of Gigs when attaching files is very small. If they can increase this,that would be useful2. When creating emails on contacts: On To:- Tab, it is only one email that must written and Freshdesk ystem will not allow you to add several email addresses under To:- TAB option. If they can change that setting, it will be very helpful.I know on CC and BCC it is ok but TO option must still be changed3. Formatting styles must changes. We have limited options on Freshdesk from Font sislze, styles to Colour. If they can see what Microsoft Word feature or Outlook looks like and work on that 4. When creating tables, they are not as presentable like the way we see on Outlook5.

Freshdesk,Freshdesk - A Great User Experience,The Freshworks team provides a great onboarding experience as well as continued support across all of their applications. They take my feature request submissions very seriously and are always able to respond to my questions quickly and efficiently.,"This platform is very very easy for both admins and end-users to navigate. There's always a learning curve when implementing a new system, but I had virtually no questions sent to me (an admin), the week of Go Live. The platform lays everything out in a way that is very straightforward to the end-user. From an admin perspective, my favorite thing is how easy it is to create workflow automations. I have created nearly 200 email routing rules. We have about 10 email addresses that our customers send emails to, and based on who the email is from, who the email is to, the domain of the sender address, the subject/content of an email, etc... we are able to create very specific routing rules to get the right emails to the right agents without needing to hand things off multiple times to different agents. I also love the use of tags. For anything that doesn't have its own field (in relation to a ticket), you can just add a tag(s). These tags can be filtered on and reported on. We heavily rely on tags to identify tickets in a variety of ways.Generally speaking, this application has significantly improved our support desk efficiency.","I wish that Freddy AI would look at all of the domains of the email addresses that are sent to us and would add those domains as unverified Companies. Right now our Companies module is empty because it needs a data import to populate. If Freddy AI could populate this data and then have an admin verify and change the company names, that'd be ideal. I think it should work similarly to the verified and unverified contacts. Outside of this, I really have no complaints. There are some additions to the Analytics reporting tool that they need, but this tool is still in Beta right now so I expect more features to be released throughout the year. The biggest painpoints with analytics right now is 1) I can only share a report with myself or all users. I cannot share with specific individuals or teams, and 2) there are chart-type limitations based on the data you are trying to display. One limitation is that you can only have 4 different metrics in a stacked bar chart. If you have 5 metrics you are tracking against, you are required to use a summary table or line chart.",5,5,5,4,5,9,1,-1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

The product is difficult to administer – even basic administration like user management is not intuitive.It is the most disappointing software I have ever purchased.,2,3,1,2,3,,-1,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Freshdesk,The best customer service desk available,We used it for daily customer service contact and it was great. It was great for assigning,Freshdesk is an amazing solution that made my daily life easier. I used it as a part of my work as a customer service agent and it helped go through the tickets quickly and efficiently. Mostly I loved how easy it made for me to track the previous interactions with the customer and how efficient it made me.,"We tried the call centre as well, but that did not work so well. We had calls drop randomly after a few seconds so we stopped using that feature.",5,5,5,5,5,10,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,-1
Freshdesk,Freshdesk is simple to setup and makes bug-tracking a cinch!,"Personally, this was the best platform that ever happened to our team. We reviewed some pay-for feature models, as well as the free bug tracker in Spiceworks (which had a ton of adware), and Freshdesk was the simplest to use and track our bugs even with the non-ability to drill down further with the tier we were using for our staff. The only other thing I would mention, is that it is not HIPAA compliant, so you want to make sure anything users are posting in there is not anything related to proprietary software. Otherwise it worked like a charm for our team, and our users seemed to like it. You do need to make sure that your teams using it have their emails alerting them, otherwise a ticket can just sit there. I found that I was reminding folks to check the freshdesk--from an IT standpoint, we were in there every day fielding tickets and this really helped us to schedule out our day/week and prioritize.","I set up and administered Freshdesk for a 200+ non-profit agency. There were three departments tracking bugs through it, and we were able to deploy it and announce its use with ease. It was easy to explain to our staff who didn't want to take time to learn something overly complex. As a non-profit, it was important to find a solution that could assist us day-to-day without breaking the bank. We were able to use the first-level with support for our use. The Freshdesk support was highly responsive and helpful if we had questions. Using this platform cut down on time spent fielding immediate requests that were not a high priority. It allowed us to really prioritize, track and automate repeat issues, and cut down on 'putting out little fires everywhere mentality.'","The automation was helpful, but I think it could have used a bit more complexity. We were able to implement an automated routing for email subjects and user emails so that certain requests or bugs/issues would go to a specific department. We used the platform in Communications, IT, and Facilities for all requests. We didn't have a bug or issue tracker prior to this platform. The Frequently Asked Questions portion of the portal really didn't end up being used, although we did use it when we first started the platform. Higher ups really liked the ability to see numbers in what we were fielding, but there was not enough drill-down in the pay/point we were using--that may have been available within higher paid levels. The automation has a lot of options for sending alerts when a new ticket is created. It can become cumbersome and send A LOT of emails. I'm not sure if there is a better way to automate/cut that down w/o losing that function. Also, the 'archive' user feature was a bit weird. We had a lot of employees that would leave and come back, and if you archived the user, it was a bit of an odd way to get them back into the platform, it's doable, just awkward.",4,4,5,4,5,10,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,-1,1
Freshdesk,Best Helpdesk Application for your Money,"First of all, they preach by example because Freshdesk's support is top notch. I found myself inspired every time I deal with them and even though I have (too) many years experience in the support business, I have learned from my interaction with Freshdesk's agents. It is clear to me that support is very important to this vendor and they obviously select and train their agents very well. Integrating the product in our environment was very easy and managing it is simple or as complex as you want it to be. I have been using Freshdesk for over 10 years now and they still surprise me with new features and new learning material (lots of how to videos, training and webinars).","Multi language, great knowledge base, easy to automate a lot of features (multi time zone groups, SLAs and Business hours/holidays support and many more) and available add ins to suit pretty much any requirement.Being on the cloud means we always have access no matter where we are or what we use (Tablet, Phone,laptop, desktop, ...). In the current world wide pandemie reality, all our agents are now working from home and the transition was seamless.","Reporting needs some love, although the basic is there. Freshdesk has recently added Analytics which is great but not that easy to configure so that you get the exact result you want. They are working on improving this. Most of the things I liked less about this software have been improved and quite a few features that we needed have been deployed over the years.

Freshdesk,"Good Software, Bad Marketing. Bait-and-Switch (beware)","While Freshdesk has a great UI, and is a feature-rich service, the truth behind the advertising leaves much to be desired. While their software is good, the pricing model isn't, and their marketing is intentional bait-and-switch. The features listed on each pricing tier are expanded upon here: freshdesk.com/features. Once you buy, and ask what's up, the support will tell you to upgrade for that feature, and link you to a page that isn't linked to from anywhere on their site: freshdesk.com/helpdesk-features, as justification.As an example, $15/agent/month includes, SLA Management, which is described from their features page as including every SLA feature, including basic things like SLA email notifications, reminders, escalation policies. You know, what anyone would think of as SLA Management. However, none of those features are actually included in that price plan. To even get email notifications of SLA violations, or have your SLA respect office hours, you'll have to pay $50/agent/month. Worse, there is no way to discover this until after you've paid and spent time getting everything set up.","Wonderful tracking and organization of emails and support issues, with a nice and clean UI, and simple tools to automate many support tasks.","Features listed as included in lower tiers on their pricing page, are not actually included until much higher tiers.See: https://freshdesk.com/helpdesk-features for the real breakdown. Freshdesk has no links to that page, and you'll only get it if you ask about a missing feature in their support portal.",4,4,1,3,1,,-1,0,1,-1,0,0,1,0,0,0
Freshdesk,"It's good enough, but some features are lackluster, too expensive or missing","You'd think that 400M of total investments gets you an insanely good piece of software. It does not.Freshdesk was a huge step up from the tool we used previously and has some nice features. It's disappointing that some of the features are lackluster implemented or missing altogether or require you to purchase a higher tier license - just to maybe get one more feature out of a whole bundle you won't need.That's not a stand-alone issue in this industry, but it's extra disappointing if you come across a promising tool that just can't go that extra mile.","It's quickly set up and you'll be working with it in no time, especially when you start from scratch and don't need to import (a lot).As you work more with it, you'll run into a few issues that you'll have to adjust to. Most of it isn't major, it's just these little things that would turn it into a great tool. So without them, it's only good.There are a few nice features when it comes to automation.","There's quite a few things I find annoying. None of them are bad enough to stop using Freshdesk altogether, but they're annoying.In no particular order: - There's no default ticket view for users, information like this is stored in cookies - and lost when a user needs to delete their cookies for one reason or the other.- Ticket list can be filtered by various criteria, those filters can be saved. But columns are set once, regardless of views. So you can't have different ticket lists where one shows the priority and the other does not for example.- Speaking of lists: They are hard coded only for contacts and companies.- The API uses base auth with a very simple password.- Automations are limited in scope and the rules need to be set up very, very carefully to make sure they don't interefere with each other.- If you want to change basic SLAs, you need to upgrade to the higher tiers. - If you want to have different Notification emails per group or type, you need to handle them in Automations (with less formating options) and not via the Email Notification Templates.- Some things are dictated by the system and can't be changed or turned off: Some notifications, some columns in the ticket views, for example.- Status codes are shared across different groups and/or products.

Freshdesk,"Customer Support has gone downhill, and they refuse to fix a perceived security issue.","Freshdesk is a good product.Their technical support is sporadic.Sometimes goodsometimes bad. Unfortunately, it is on the downturn again. When I first started, I had to wait days for a support question to be answered, and to contact a salesperson was almost impossible.Their phone support is unusable.It rings forever, and when you do get through since it is impossible to get throughthough you cannot hear them.The times I have gotten through and left a message, noone has replied to my question.When your a single person business this is frustrating,The support became better and now it is going back downhill again.I feel I have to convince them that something is wrong.What is most bothersome is they don't understand as a single person business I cannot spend days on a problem, and if I tell them there is an issue such as an attack on an email address, which I have no control over and they don't fix it.",The software has a great deal of functionality.,"If you do not have a support email on your site, you create a support email address (which you must) on their site. You have no control over it. My account is continuously spammed. They insist the email address is my problem, but I keep telling me the email account is not on my mail server, so how can I filter it.Isent Freshdesk documentation showing the support email address is not on my mail server, but Freshdesk insists it is my email problem.Anyway, you receive lots of spam and no way of filtering it. When we first were attacked, I had over 300 spammed contacts.The other issue is a two-step process to delete the emails. The problem could be abated by requiring any user who creates a contact on the site to verify.The problem is that some of their clients do not want this.So why not put an option that allows their clients to choose if they wish verification emails or not.The additional issue is if someone can spam your Freshdesk site, then they think they can spam any of your sites.",4,4,2,5,4,3,-1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Freshdesk,Support Detail,"Our business needs quickly expanded into handling over 50 tickets / work orders a day across multiple client sites.

Freshdesk software ticked all the boxes when it came to the online portal access for clients and exporting ticket information into CSV files.","- Creating, monitoring and finding specific information: EXCELLENT- User interface is very fresh, intuitive and user friendly- Keeping track of files was an added feature I didn't expect and wasvery useful the bigger the tickets became. - Splitting and Merging tickets is a must for any helpdesk. This software is very intuitive on this feature. - Mobile App is so easy to use across IOS and Android. - Reporting Functions are excellent - really think the custom dashboard is a REAL PROwhen considering a Helpdesk Software Solution. - Setup: If your not a tech person, Freshdesk live support is excellent.

Freshdesk,Simple and Intuitive,We decided to try this out as our ticketing solution and were very impressed. Packed with features even at the lower tiers. At the lowest priced tier we're able to integrate Microsoft Teams and VSTS/Azure DevOps which is huge for us. The features are also very organized so the admin page doesn't have 200+ options to skim through.,"FreshDesk has found a way to offer similar options without cluttering your screen with unnecessary options. You're able to expand on your options with custom fields/tags/etc but the basics cover most scenarios. My favorite feature though is how easy it is to update a ticket department/agent/status. You can do it from the ticket view screen that lists all your tickets. Why is no one else doing this? Seems obvious now that I'm using it ha, it's even available on the phone app, big time-saver. It really seems like a lot of thought was put into creating this product.","One thing I really didn't like is the table view for tickets. I have large monitors and this doesn't expand the width so I end up with a bunch of empty space to each side of the table. You can change the Layout and the Card view helps, but I prefer the consolidated table view, but not if I have to scroll to the right with empty space on the page that could've been used. Another thing I noticed that could improve is the options for the email. Our previous solution would create the ticket and move the email from the inbox to our archive folder so we keep a history in a second place. FreshDesk currently as of 2019 only has the option to delete or leave the emails there. Not that big of a deal, but would be nice.",5,5,5,5,5,10,1,-1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
Freshdesk,A Fresh Start to Better Customer/Issue Tracking,"We needed to migrate from a support solution that was bought out by Microsoft.Microsoft CRM Dynamics was too expensive, so we reviewed over a dozen solution providers.The Freshworks team worked with us to ensure we had a successful implementation (3 months - part time).They were also very receptive to our feedback and have incorporated those ideas into Freshdesk.We just got done adding another SSL certificate for our latest product's portal.The support team came through again with flying colors!","We use Freshdesk every day to capture and work customer-reported issues.The ease of use has a major factor migrating from our former portal solution.We were able to keep things simple while still capturing all the critical elements of the issues. The Solutions page (knowledge base) was/is very easy to maintain and update.From an Administrative perspective, the product is easy to configure and customize.Further, we have enjoyed nearly 100% up time over a year and a half!","We were hoping to port over prior ticket history from our prior solution, but were unable to capture conversations as part of our migration.However, Freshworks was able to create new records for each legacy ticket as part of our conversion.In the long run, only a couple customers ever noticed their prior ticket submissions.",5,5,5,4,5,9,1,0,-1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

Some of the new features have helped us tremendously while others (FSM) has got us thinking on efficiency in our field work.","In improving the system, a few of our favored features are taken off. For instance, with Linked Tickets we are unable to send bulk emails from the Tracker. The alternative is to send bulk emails from the Tickets view or filtered view; this is tedious if one has to select individual tickets which notice is meant for or when there are multiple linked tickets to different trackers.Also, Email Outreach should have the alternative of selecting contact from Freshdesk instead of uploading a CSV file",5,5,5,5,5,10,1,-1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Reasonable price. Otherwise, I like the way tickets can be prioritized with SLAs, status, etc. Canned responses and automations are great too.","The automations, despite being very nice, are somewhat limited in terms of what they can do. Sometimes I'd like to go a little further than what they can offer. It's often just little details, but it could make a big difference.Here are a few basic examples:1) IF field is empty, THEN send a notification to the user with a message saying that it has to be updated. This is not possible since we can't have an automation triggered by a field being left blank.2) Only the custom fields with drop down lists can be used as triggers for automations.Also, I'd like to be able to have the SLA based on the expected first response rather than the expected resolution.Overall though, it makes my job a lot easier.",5,5,4,4,5,10,1,-1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
Freshdesk,You're on your own,Pros:The platform is relatively user friendly and has a sufficient number of features to work well.,"Cons:Service is highly unreliable, and if something significant happens - don't expect Freshdesk to be available to help you. It can take 2-4 days to get a hold of someoneEVEN IF YOU ARE FUNCTIONALLY SHUT DOWN.Here was our experience: We had been using Freshdesk for 3-4 years and were relative experts on our plan. We arranged to make a change to our Freshdesk plan to switch to a multi-product platform. We upgraded to a plan costing 7x our current cost per user and requested to speak with a Success Manager to plan to the changes. It took persistence and some time to get on the phone with someone. The person we got has had relatively low product knowledge, but escalated to a very competent product engineer fairly promptly. We confirmed our plan and attempted to implement independently after business hours. We were forced to initiate a backout plan when errors and unpredictable behaviour blocked our completion. Our backout plan partially failed and customers were impacted for 3 days before we were able to get anyone to help us. We heard a myriad of responses via email as to why a phone call was not possible from, I am not working today to I will give you a call next week at your convenience and I will have XX get a hold of you to help - but no call, no chat, no email Q&A -- radio silence. We got the message loud and clear 'you are not that important'.Be warned - if something go wrong, the documentation is very modest and don't necessarily expect help.","Alternatives Considered:Jira,Zoho Desk,Salesforce Sales CloudandZendesk Suite",2,4,1,4,2,1,1,-1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Your in house IT team can set this up themselves and you dont need to spend a fortune getting a consultancy firm to do it for you.The interface is also very intuitive and even without any training your staff should be able to do the basics.We looked at other solutions that were more of an all in one kinda package that also included financial, stock/warehousing etc but found that these were overly complex and as a result made us work less efficient and the helpdesk staff also did not want to use it because it was just too bloated for their needs.Freshdesk does ticketing and it does it well. The company does have other software modules and integrations that you can add if you want (addon integration apps or maybe look at their other products like Freshsales or Freshservice)If you just want a great easy to use ticking system, definitely give Freshdesk a try.

To me Freshdesk is a developing underdog on the CRM market with some huge advantages and opportunities. We selected them because we can have some top notch solutions just like we had Freshdesk or Zendesk, but we do not have to leave a fortune there.

This is partially because of their support team as we have always been able to contact then and ask any type of questions regarding their software.

It is good that you are able to customize your portal URL, but if you do you are not going to have HTTPS until you pay more. This makes this whole function questionable.

Great platform to provide internal/external support.,"We have been using this software for more than 2.5 years now in our company to assist our consultants, vendors and clients. Freshdesk is a cloud based helpdesk system, which allows its users to resolve all day-to-day queries by generating tickets. This ticketing system works well internally and externally. Being a part of the HR Team, we receive approximately 20-30 tickets per day from our employees/Clients and other companies for assistance regarding pay, employment verification, employment letters, leaves etc. The employees send their queries to a common HR Group ID and then we allocate it to the concerned person within the team.The Fresh desk support is implemented by the technical department of our company as well where the internal employees raise tickets in case of any technical issues.The interface is easy to use and simple. It also provides guidelines and prompts for a new user, making it extremely easy to learn and start without much assistance.

It also keeps a clear and manageable history of all the recently closed tickets. It also provides a feature to export a complete summary of the tickets group wise with categories and subjects, date of receipt and closure.Freshdesk has an in-built contact directory for all internal employees making it easier to allocate copy or forward the tickets.","As per our existing needs, I do not see any cons.

Freshdesk,Freshdesk can help you manage & grow your MSP business,"Freshdesk helped BootUp LLC to get on top of their user help desk support problems, and this NYC-based MSP is now poised to grow its client base by hiring more technical staff and expanding its support offerings. Our collective experience with Freshdesk has been extremely positive, and we recommend it wholeheartedly!","Freshdesk enables your clients to create their own help desk request tickets, track their ticket's progress, add notes & comments along the way, and decide when to mark each ticket as Done. Once you know what the solutions to their most common problems are, you can post self-service procedures for the easy ones that they can handle themselves - thus freeing you from unnecessary remote support or onsite support events. Use the built in ticket timers, and you have a way to capture the data for your Time & Billing system. And you can build your user community with a built-in user forum and links to your social media accounts. Help desk managers can spot check the Dashboard and see at a glance how many & which tickets are unresolved, overdue, due today, unassigned,or on hold pending various 3 party issues. All of these features are designed to help you get on top of your service delivery and get the metrics you need to maintain quality service while adding clients & technicians.Pair Freshdesk with Teamviewer Corporate and you have a powerful Help Desk with one click remote support connectivity to any PC at any client location anywhere. Now you can deliver quality support with fewer truck rolls!","My only real problem had to do with Notification Alert Sounds. I wanted a way to use different new ticket alert sounds depending upon with the client, priority or assigned to me status so that I could walk away from my workstation and do other work in the computer lab but get a loud sound alert for critical new help desk tickets. A prompt response from the Freshdesk support team let me know that none of the major browsers support custom notification sounds in their API's, so there is no way to implement this at this time. (Hey Google Chrome & Microsoft IE teams: how about custom notification sounds in the next update release? Very useful for advanced users!)",5,5,5,5,5,10,1,0,1,0,0,1,-1,1,0,0
Freshdesk,"Great tool, even at the lower price tiers","Overall, my gripes are relatively minor, and for the most part have usable workarounds. FreshDesk has proven an invaluable tool for our small team, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid ticketing system. In fact, I already have!","The interface clear and navigable, making it simple to switch from our old ticketing system. It's easy to work together on a single ticket, especially with the ability to create Private Notes visible only to agents. Email templates help speed things up, and time-based rules ensure that tickets don't sit idle too often. Also handy are the apps that allow you to expand some of the functionality or customize features. While the ticketing features are handy, I've recently started delving into the Solutions, aka knowledgebase.It's easy to format, and gives you some flexibility with HTML. I think we'll be able to leverage it for some very useful tutorials. In the meantime, we have a single page with a picture from The IT Crowd captioned Have you tried turning it off and on again?Finally, I'd like to give kudos to FreshDesk support. They are very responsive, usually replying within a couple of hours. I don't think we've had a single ticket stay open (waiting for reply) for more than a day. As an example, another organization we support had difficulty getting outgoing email working. FreshDesk's DKIM service wasn't functioning properly, making it impossible for them to send mail from the tool. They identified the issue quickly, and were able to address the underlying technical issues in a satisfactory timeframe. Overall we haven't had many problems, but where we've had them, they got fixed or explained to our satisfaction.","Unfortunately, some of the explanations from support have been That's available in a higher price bracket. We're on the Blossom level, the first paid tier, and some features that we'd find useful are only available in higher tiers that are cost-prohibitive for our two-person team. It'd be nice to have an a la carte menu to be able to add a few features for a few dollars, rather than nearly doubling our cost. Still, those features are nice to have, not necessary, and we are functioning quite well despite their absence. I can definitely see how larger teams would benefit from them though, so I don't begrudge the tiers' mere existence.There are a couple of weird things about the Solutions builder. I wish it was more of a what you see is what you get tool, though you do have the ability to preview your drafts before publishing the page. For example, I wanted include some footnotes, using superscript numbers in the text for indexing. This wasn't in the available formatting options, so I used the [much-appreciated] HTML editor. The problem is, the numbers continue to appear as plain text in the standard editor, and only appear as superscript in the preview (and of course the published page). This makes proofing cumbersome.",5,4,5,4,5,10,1,0,1,-1,1,0,1,0,-1,0
Freshdesk,Really good & well designed helpdesk software - I checked almost all of them and chose Freshdesk.,"Much more speed and efficiency in our support work flow : Automation, assignements, grouping, tagging, SLA, Monitoring, Canned Responses, Integrated Widget, Email Forwarding, Facebook integration, etc. Looking forward to integrate the telephony also :-)","I'm tech manager in a growing online business and our support team is currently 3 agents. We needed to transition our support flow from mostly shared email support to something more efficient and I was the one to explore and choose the tech solution that we would implement - I chose Freshdesk. Here is why: The User Experience is very very well designed. I looked into ZenDesk, ZohoDesk, Desk.com, Kayako, Cayzu and others and they were all about the same price however Freshdesk stands out for the ease of use by far. Desk.com was the second-best design however it was quite bland. Freshdesk was surprisingly easy to understand for the less technically inclined people in my team and that is a win.Freshdesk is full of features and while there are many we won't use in the foreseeable future there were enough really useful ones in the first paid plan [Blossom] that we felt comfortable justifying this expense for 3 agents and eventually 4. The ease of use of these features especially compared to shared mail made us buy into Freshesk: 'Group', 'assigned to', 'Tags', ' Dispatcher' , ' Observer'.We found how to automate all of them.I had EXCELLENT tech support to customize the ticket fields and widgets; we needed API calls and Webhooks used to fit the workflow to our preferred implementation and really the tech person knew his job, was always patient and knew what to suggest and how to help me configure Freshdesk above and beyond what I expected.","The time before we became paying Freshdesk customers is the one place where I feel there is a need for more care. Once we are paying clients however the service is really good. Here are my main points for them to work on: 1. Please, we don't want to feel even the slightest pressure to buy into Freshdesk:we are a slow-moving company tech-wise and we needed more time to try all the features without having our trial deleted. The free trial is 21 days. We did receive one full extension and part of another and our assigned agent was as patient as she could about our slow pace; however I had the impression that behind her she maybe was pressured to ' close the sale ' . I felt pressured to go faster than our time budget was allowing to fully explore in depth Freshdesk. 2. That agent was also somewhat slow at first to answer to some questions I had before committing to a paid plan.3. While I was exploring the whole feature set of Freskdesk I felt that she was not sufficiently able to help me understand why the first paid plan would be better for us than the free plan. I had made a list of features I wanted more info about and even on a live call I would have liked for her to be able to go deeper with me in my understanding of Freshdesk at that time. I felt she was mostly reading the same feature-sheet as me.4. So we committed to Freshdesk a bit before being fully ready however by then I knew that there were more than enough paid features for us to make the jump.",5,5,5,5,5,10,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,-1,1,1
Freshdesk,Stop forwarding emails now,"Time saving functionality on many levels. Less emails in your inbox, and less hitting the forward button. Best part, if you're using Zendesk, you can import your emails from there when you get started. The functions in the free version are fantastic. Help desk, HELPS, but responding quickly. All private messages on a ticket or message are kept together with the email chain and kept private (unless you want the client to see the message). Recommend this product","I love the interaction with our team members. It's so easy to 'assign' emails to the correct department and the correct person within that department. Forget about hitting the forward button again, and having your team mates emails clog up with FWD: subject lines. You are also able to privately leave notes for your colleagues that the client doesn't see, but remains with the email chain! Happy days indeed. The customer service is great - even with the free version! - and you'll hear back very quickly about your queries or concerns. Nothing is too big or too small for them to respond to.Also, you can set-up response times, and review how the team is going reaching the company's response time. This is a great function to see how your team responds to clientele and also to see the average resolution time of tasks. You're also able to change timezones so that this reflects more accurately.Love, love, love the autoforward function, ie. if this email address @123abc.com sends an email it automatically gets assigned to this person in the team and this group. This isn't 100% accurate, but it's helped save time overall with minimal unassigned tasks coming through.","By setting up groups and team members of those groups, unfortunately if you assign it to the person & the group they'll get 2 email separate email reminders for the same email. We get around this by simply assigning it to the person in the group responsible, and they themselves apply it to the client group.Another thing that is a little annoying, is if you apply it to a group - it leaves the email in 'unassigned' on the dashboard. Only if you apply it to a person will it remove it from this section. Again we just ensure we assign it to an individual.",4,3,4,5,5,8,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,-1,0

The user-friendliness of the UI, as well as its vivid method of generating and receiving information. The platform's storage capacity and the extent to which it can be used as a whole are both capped.","Freshdesk's biggest flaw is that it can be extremely sluggish to launch.

Freshdesk,The comprehensive answer to boosting productivity and teamwork in customer service,"Firstly, it has vastly improved our customer service; with Freshdesk, we can centralize the management of all customer requests, which speeds up our responses and helps us solve issues more quickly. On the other side, integrating many communication channels into a single setting allows us to process more requests in less time. It has also impacted internal collaboration thanks to features that facilitate our agents working together to address an issue or fulfill a request. Finally, it has customer service metrics and reporting capabilities.","As a regular user of Freshdesk, I can attest that it is a powerful and intuitive platform for customer service. We can respond to emails, chats, and social media messages directly from the platform, which results in significant time savings for the organization's customer support team and makes us more efficient, which is something I like about this tool. The dashboard is an excellent feature because it shows me how customers interact with the company. Last but not least, Freshdesk has a fantastic support team that is always eager to assist and quick to offer solutions to any issues we may have.","Freshdesk's steep price tag is a deal breaker for many businesses, especially those with a smaller or medium budget.

Freshdesk,Fresh as its name suggests,"Fresh, intuitive, and a must-have tool for any helpdesk team. Freshdesk has helped improve helpdesk staff productivity, efficiency, as well as customer and top-level satisfaction.","Freshdesk gives us a fresh take on getting helpdesk support and updates. First of all, I love the fresh look and user interface. It is friendly and easy to create tickets and revisit the portal to get status updates.It acts as a centralized hub for our support team in terms of collating all helpdesk items from multiple channels like email, voice calls, chat, etc. It is also easy to see who is assigned/acting on a ticket in order to avoid two staff working on the same ticket (too many cooks spoil the broth). Canned responses is also great since it saves us time from re-composing the same incident resolution for recurring problems (like the common concern of password reset, network/account access..etc).Another thing is the reporting power of Freshdesk. We can churn out the performance levels of each helpdesk staff, even for the whole department. We can also generate reports to see the most frequent person/departments who request a lot of support, or which incidents turn out to be problems and for possible root cause analysis and resolution.One more thing, is the all-important Service Level Management (SLA) which can be set up and managed well from within Freshdesk. SLA Performance reports can be easily downloaded and intuitive enough to be used for future IT strategy and planning.","The notifications can be a powerful tool for reminding the staff or triggering an action, however, Freshdesk can sometimes tend to flood the staff with all these notifications for example if a person is assigned a ticket and is also part of a group, the email sends at least twice. We'll have to look into how the setup for notifications can be more optimized.",5,5,4,5,4,10,1,0,1,0,1,0,-1,0,0,1

The integration with the suite is nearly flawless, and I gave it a solid 2-month trial to see if it was right for me.The only reason it wasn't is that I'm a solopreneur, and as counterintuitive as it might sound, Freshdesk can easily be run by one person or 500. it's that scalable and built with the intent that a small team could be comprised of 4-10 people, and every single part of the software you can master in two weeks, and yet still find it surprisingly comfortable.","it's meant for at least a small team. one person by themselves can't run the whole show, which, oddly enough, having 35 more pieces of software, you can pull off with ZOHO. or at least I can.. I'm entirely into Zoho for the price. I just simply couldn't afford freshdesk's solopreneur pricing. it's not for freelancers, it's for teams... minimum 5 people before you're making full use of the suite which all came from freshdesk. (yes, I'm talking about the suite freshworks as if it was desk... trust me, you don't want just the desk...)... this is a rare case where they pull off a near perfect piece of software, but price out the little guys so that we don't get to play with their toys... but then again, I did say it was only semi-customizable.it's not like caspio or Zoho creator or a number of other CRM suites which have moved well into the low/no code markets by making their own flagship products with their own entry-level builder, just to show what it can do if you actually use it to it's potential.... freshdesk has limited potential, but unlimited freshness, oh.. and it's probably good that they make it unaffordable to the little guys, because this is not entry level software... you HAVE to know about crime and ticketing and VoIP and all that jazz before you touch this. I have about 10 years dealing with CRM's, and they are almost starting to catch up to how I feel they should work... freshdesk, it's an almost. with not much for options to make it my own, even if i cuuld afford it.",5,3,4,4,3,8,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I realize that they need to have money, but for an account that is merely a rep that answers tickets vs an administrator account that needs access to everything, there should definitely be a difference in pricing. Integration with other systems, depending on the system, can be painful at times. Integrating into other sites is possible, but would require real programming.

It is also ideal for small businesses and sole proprietorships, as they have very affordable free and paid plans. Even if you only have a 1-person helpdesk, having cases that are customized to a case management system, rather than using email, will make your existence much more convenient.","The system is hosted and therefore does not require infrastructure in our hands, a great advantage. Also, there has been no inconvenience in that the system is not available to colleagues or clients. For the users, the experience is also very refined.

It does the job and it's easy to use but I'd like to see more granular security. Presently you can restrict to groups but it's like to see restrictions by sub groups. For example, Agents are a group. IT people are a sub-group of Agent. Some solutions are for IT people only. I would also like to be able to easily mass-email customers and groups of customers or companies.

It's easy to build custom flows with certain ticket characteristics to redirect tickets to certain reps, depending on their product knowledge and skills.","I think its integration with other apps/platforms is something that Freshdesk can improve on. I use Salesforce on a daily basis and was hoping to integrate Freshdesk with it, but the integration is not the most efficient.

Freshdesk,Simple Ticketing System with some nice features,"Pros:FreshDesk does a good job of simplifying the process of getting up and running with a ticketing system for whatever your business or needs are. There are a variety of subscription levels that you can choose from which makes it somewhat nice in terms of what features you need vs which ones you don't need and would rather not pay for. The initial setup is a bit to get through to make sure that you have everything customized the way you want it, but for the most part, once it's up and running it's pretty close to a set it and forget it environment.","Cons:Some of the features across different tiers don't make as much sense. Obviously, they're a for-profit company so they want to make money, but some of the more seemingly basic aspects aren't included in any of the lower tiers. Also, there have been at least two instances where an issue has occurred that impacted our account and ticketing system (one was a ddos and another was a listed feature that we were unable to find on our admin screen). Both times when I called in the agent replied quickly with oh, we have that available, it's just not turned on for your account.Both times when I asked if there were any other secret features (like the advanced email SPAM protection that was offered to help with the ddos attack) that we were paying for but not using the response was you have to ask for specific features to turn on.

I think its being fixed in new release and agent become user upon deleting it.You can't automate certain things like notifying agent or making him watcher if one who is not cced on ticket want to add something to it, you have to fwd him the ticket first.It has limited user control like You can't hide customer information from certain level of users.

Freshdesk,Perfect Customer Service solution for our Shopify-based E-Commerce company,"Pros:Our team operates 2 different E-Commerce brands out of Shopify that have gone up in about a year and half.We could not have done it without Freshdesk.To me, it's similar to Shopify in that it is a true example of how building a product based on the user experience, then designing your reporting & data analytic capabilities, can deliver a powerhouse product.Freshdesk is a clean, intuitive experience that multiple Customer Service associates have picked up and been ready to roll with in a day or two.We have fully integrated it with our Shopify site - tickets submitted on our site come through Freshdesk, as does the on-site chat window, ALL social media comments or posts, and our cust service number.As our team member is speaking with or responding to a customer, she has all of the information tied to their order right in front of her, built into the ticket - that's the Shopify integration.We have most recently gotten disciplined about we are using the tags feature, which again operates very similarly to how Shopify does.Our service rep now has a list of all tags that should be connected to tickets and what they mean.This makes it super simple for us to run reports on common customer complaints, centralize PR inquiries, etc.","Cons:Compared to Zendesk, I think Freshdesk is a little more expensive starting out with only a couple of users (where we are currently).However, I believe that Freshdesk becomes the more affordable option as you scale, and with the great experience I've had I doubt I would ever switch.",,5,5,4,5,5,10,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0

The learning curve is not very steep.,There are few features missing from the free and entry level versions that would make it shine and there doesn't seem to be a logical reason why these are missing.

Freshdesk,Great features with MAJOR crippling flaw,"As a growing start-up and now a small business, we cut our teeth on Freshdesk. It did a great job early on as it just worked and was easy to use. However as we grew we found that it had a productivity crippling flaw, one they have known about for years, and that is SPAM.Once you get a batch of 2000+ blatant spam emails from Russia that create tickets, you quickly realize how bad it can get. We have received spam on almost a daily basis for a long time, but it was usually ranging from a couple to around 5 or 6 a day. You go in and mark the ticket as spam and block the email and are good to go. However as we got larger, we started getting them in batches of 100s and then even on that was 2000+. What made this bad is that the domain and IP were both blacklisted and the content failed standard spam tools with a very high score. So this would have been easy to block.So what makes this so painful, is that you now have to go manually close and mark as spam those 2000+ tickets , delete 2000+ emails from your inboxes, and try and keep up with your legit ticket queue.What made this worse, is when I went to their support forum and realize this has been a problem for years that they have known about and have showed no interest in fixing beyond the manual process.Unfortunately this made the difficult decision of changing support systems too easy, I won't say who we are switching to as I don't want it to seem I am trying to promote.","Easy to use and setup! Everyone on our team, even the non-technical, could get in and use the system. Ticketing was a breeze and administrating was just as easy.","Spam!

The Parent child and Shared ownership really did not help. Problem- Once a ticket is assigned to another person then the next ticket of the Investor gets automatically assigned to the same person which is not applicable in our case.","Reasons for Choosing Freshdesk:During the time of purchase Freshworksseemed to be best alternative because of theease inintegration . Moreover we were just a team of 4 at that time hence seemed to be quite manageable with the features available however currently when almost 25 people are using , the same software seems to be-lacking certain features which should be allowed to get customised as per Client's requirement .

Freshdesk,It Just Works...and Works Well,"Pros:The Freshworks applications are all easily integrated with each other, which makes it easy to set up. The apps in the marketplace make it easy to integrate with most other systems, which is great. I evaluated several products over a week and weekend, standing up different trials for a proof of concept. Freshdesk was the only one that I was able to get started with a minimal amount of configuration. As in, it took me an hour to stand it up, create users, generate test tickets, create responders - almost within an hour. It was insane how much easier it was than the competition. Additionally, the pricing was easy to understand and flexible enough to grow as we grow.","Cons:It would be great if Freshworks could get on board with some of the new companies like Front, Canny, and Notion. These are great tools that could benefit the support process and especially how we work, but there are no apps for them.

Freshdesk,Freshdesk,"Great experience. As an admin, or process coordinator you get a great overview of the agent's operation.

Also it was very difficult to keep track of the agents performance.","This software is very easy to use. I have enjoyed a lot how easy to customize and to use it is and how it has helped us organize tickets/tasks assignment for agents, considering priorization, status and as many variables as we need.The users are able to set SLAs and all fields the agents need to use. A practical feature is that you can respond via email, and even customers can create tickets by sending their request to a designated e-mail account. It is a great tool for teamwork as it allows collaboration using private notes for team members and forwarding info to third parties that do not necessarily have a Freshdesk account.I also love that it shows motivational quotes when the features are loading!","I believe there is still a lot to improve on the reports side.They are very limited.Also, it would be of great help to get a tool that automatically merged tickets by their content (email body) so that the agents would not have to merge tickets manually.",5,5,3,4,3,7,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,-1,1,0

Freshdesk,"Impressive tools for no cost, and more pro features when you're ready","I started using this service over a year ago. I stumbled upon it while trying to find an affordable option for a client with a small budget, and was so impressed that I adopted it myself. It's now my go-to recommendation for people who want an integrated service that connects their customer service ticketing system, CRM, live chat support and more. Back in the day, a service like this would've cost tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars, and wouldn't have been half as easy to use, setup, or train people on. You really can't go wrong with this service, especially on the free tier.","What Fresh Desk offers for free is, in a word, incredible. Besides the obvious helpdesk features, which allow you to track customer tickets, the service can also integrate with many of Fresh's other services. For example, you can setup Fresh Chat, their live chat software for dealing with customers in real time from your website. They have companion apps that run on your smartphone and your PC, so you're always available to potential customers. You can also integrate with Fresh Sales, their CRM software, so you can convert those customer chats into contacts, leads, tickets and more. The integration isn't automatic, but it's not difficult. I put together everything in a couple of hours.","Probably just the time it takes to setup the integrations with their other services, but at the same time, it wasn't *that* difficult. Still, it's worth being aware for the technically challenged: there is some tech work that needs to happen on the back end so the various services can communicate, and you'll need to install the live chat software to your website as well.",4,5,,5,5,10,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,-1,1
Freshdesk,FreshDesk is Middle of the Pack,"Pros:from what i've seen/heard it's a more affordable option but with that, and the fact that FD is relatively new to the game, there are better options out there. but FD checks most of the boxes. the reporting and analytics leaves a lot to be desired and isn't very reliable. but if you're looking for a standard ticketing system that allows you to reach out to customers and prioritize work, FD will suit your needs. not a lot of bells and whistles but there are customization options and FreshWorks has been quite accommodating.","Cons:what i liked least about this software is:- lack of reliable/easy to use reporting- you cannot download historical data of each individual ticket. to see the full history of the ticket (e.g. how many times it's been reassigned, how many people have viewed the ticket/worked the ticket, etc.) you need to go into the ticket directly. you can't export that level of detail- the automation rules are clunky to maintain and sometimes there are competing priorities of the rules so you need to review the order of your rules to ensure everything fires properly- support has been a mixed bag. one person we used to work with was great and very helpful. he has since left and our new liason tries to be hands-off. it shouldn't take me 3 different emails to get the assistance i need","Reasons for Choosing Freshdesk:to be clear, our team did not choose this product. it was chosen for us. i'm not sure what other options were presented to us but we're essentially working with what we got.",3,3,3,3,,3,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,-1,0,1

We started off with a lot of other self-hosted brands and options, however, leaving our ticketing and help solutions to Freshdesk was the best move I've ever made and they offer everything we need in one place.We love particularly the feature to add custom stuff to the right side pane of tickets like: The recent tickets associated to the client, Quick ticket status and assignment changes, creating a remote session right from the ticket with ScreenConnect addon and, a to-do list to allow the next technician to know what has and hasn't been done yet.",I think for the type of account we have there are no cons at all.

Last time I heard from the Freshdesk team is that they are rolling out new automation features, but only in batches :(, how many Freshdesk accounts are out there? Freshdesk also does not have a native integration to Instagram as it has for Facebook. The Facebook integration also has its weak points, such as not being able to block or remove a comment on Freshdesk without having to log into Facebook manager.

The UI and UX also is very user friendly. The customer support is also very reliable, we get response ticket that we raise with in 24 hours. I like their live chat feature the most it helps us connect with our customers at a very good base and real time. We are also able to solve that queries within minutes because of the live chat feature.",There are very few things that we dislike about this software.One of the things that they can improve is their role out of new features.

For me everything was set already during trial. Unlike some rivals, very little customisation is required. Most frequently used features like reply templates, SLAs, ticketing routing rules, customer profile fields are available. I'm using EU server and the additional cost is reasonably cheap. I'm also using other services in Freshworks including Freshcaller, Freshping, Freshchat which are all migrated seamlessly. Freshdesk's team rolls out new features every quarter without extra cost.

It was easy to set up too, but the modern consumer expects nothing else.","Even simple requests like adding a new priority level to your tickets can not be done. Currently, they have 'Low, Medium, High, Urgent' and you as an admin can not edit this list. Another thing I wanted to do was if the ticket met certain criteria to push it to gitlab, I tried to do this with the native integration and with their zapier integration. In both situations you can only chose to send all tickets to gitlab, which makes no sense. Worst of all, the UX in their ticketing system has caused miscommunication with clients on several occations.

We integrated the Customer Connect portal with Freshdesk. That is, customers registered on Customer Connect do not have to again login into the Freshdesk portal, they directly get access to the Freshdesk portal.

I was able to design my tickets very easily with no additional help which is a very nice thing to have. In the future, I look forward to continuing my new designs in tickets and using more of its features to do so. Another thing that I enjoyed about Freshdesk is the organization tools that they have which makes it super easy to access things. I feel the whole time I'm using Freshdesk I know where everything is and never fear losing anything or not being able to find the things I need.","Cons:One thing that I liked least about Freshdesk was the slow speed that I experienced when I was trying to navigate my way around. However, this happened very rarely but when it did occur, I found myself having to wait around 5-10 minutes just to get Freshdesk to load. To test this, I ran other sites, rebooted my wifi, and even tried different wifi, and would still experience slow speed.

Freshdesk,"Has become integral to our business, bit pricey","Pros:At some point we had too many mailboxes and too much email to properly track customer emails so we switched to Freshdesk and now we can stay on top of everything. We don't use it as a traditional ticketing system, we run all our email through it but it works. Canned responses are useful, alerts when 2 agents are working on an email at the same time, or if a response has just been sent while you were typing really help to avoid unintended miscommunication and using automations its possible to make up for any missing out of the box features (like snoozing an email).We use it every day. While I have some issues with it, we're basically running our business out of it so I'm pretty happy with it overall.","Cons:They recently upgraded the design which I like, but it has come with a host of little issues.My least favourite feature is adding a slash command in the WYSIWYG editor as it means that you can't type a space-slash/ in an email any more which seems bonkers to me.The price per agent is a bit steep. If you switch up to a higher plan to get additional features then your price per agent increases along with it making it a bit pricey for temporary staff and new hires. I think this is largely because we aren't using it as a traditional ticketing-support system.",,4,4,,5,4,7,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,-1,1

We were nervous about support when it was clear we were getting transferred to an overseas center when we called, but we were pleasantly surprised that each support call was handled quickly, professionally, and in a helpful manner without long hold times. These guys are the exception to the rule in that regard.Conclusion: Good product at fair price from a good company.","Fast, works well, good support, good editor, API for single-sign-on, allowing users of our product to automatically authenticate to our support site without a separate logon.","Their chat option, FreshChat, is not good because there's no way to indicate when your agents are offline or online, just an indicator of avg response time, allowing people to think you're there to answer a chat when you may have just left.We would like a few more options for customizing the look and feel of our support site, beyond just choosing colors, but without the need for advanced HTML/CCS - things like fonts, columns, default number of items before more etc.",5,4,5,4,4,9,1,-1,0,0,0,1,-1,1,-1,1

It allowed me to tailor the ticket template to exactly what worked for me. I was also able to adjust the remainder of the admin settings to make Freshdesk work exactly how I needed it to for how I logged tickets with my organization.Freshdesk also has several great features that I don't use personally but I think would be very beneficial to larger teams , etc.I looked at several leading solutions before deciding on Freshdesk but they required me to follow a mandatory process / workflow or their customization options were limited.Freshdesk surprised me with all it was packed with.I haven't had to contact Freshdesk support on many occasions over the past 3 years but they were always fast and friendly when I did require some help.",Cons:I can't think of any cons really.

Seems fast and easy to use, and like bulk updating, bulk merging, and being able to select the main ticket when merging tickets is also a good feature.","You can't open more than one ticket at once on the same page, also the main body of tickets doesn't stretch over wide screen, so you have to scroll on the screen to see if you aren't on card view. Also, IP whitelisting is only on the top tier, I feel this should be a feature available on any.

Freshdesk,Freshdesk is a must-have for SaaS companies,"Freshdesk has given us improved customer support. We handle queries almost immediately thanks to Freshdesk's ticket support. The server is very organized and has almost no glitches, ticket filters are done in the best way and can suggest when a ticket is urgent and when it requires less time to attend. General questions, support issues, feature enablement requests, all that and more we give solutions to the customer through Freshdesk.","Freshdesk shows us important integrations to improve the service, such is the case of Jira that allows us to manipulate certain tools from Freshdesk. Ticket categorization is automatic and immediate and then transferred to the appropriate department for immediate response and solution. Freshdesk assigns multiple tickets to teams and allows us to track from start to finish any problem presented by the customer. The escalation of tickets through Freshdesk is totally correct and accurate, there are different levels of support and each one is intended to give you the best experience in terms of response time. They can be moved between departments and it does not differ at all in the final response making it perfect and what the customer is looking for.","Freshdesk lacks a core API to be able to mass extract data from all tickets. Sometimes the response time through the POST API is ridiculously long which in turn generates a delay in responses through the same API.

But I think that every software product evolves as market suggests it to evolve. And I think that customer base that freshdesk has on a regular base can better suggest on how to elaborate product in relation to its work flows and API freshdesk items accessibility. One of the things that we would like to see is easier access to API for retrieving Collections of Items that are related to Tickets or other Entities without relation to those Entities specifically. So if I would like to find out Ticket Types, I canget the Types. If I would like to find out Tags, I would like to grab Tags without knowing anything about any ticket...Just an example. Expanding lookup table functionality across the domain would definitely make API even more powerful and empowering for any team to use.

Freshdesk,"Aside from a few missing features and occasional speed/access issues, agreat and simple product.","Pros:Freshdesk is the simplest and easiest to use ticket system that I have come across.Its relatively simple to get up and running, and adding/removing agents (without affecting reports) couldn't be easier.There are a large number of plugins available, and we can create our own automation with their version of macros (for example, I have an email go out to the ticket creator if a ticket was created during off-business hours).In my experience, configuring such automatic replies and other simple reactive actions is much more difficult in other ticket system tools, and Freshdesk aces this.Other than that, I have never lost anything - nothing is better than reliability.We're approaching 100,000 total tickets, and accessing ticket number 1 is just as easy now as it was when we first rolled out the solution.","Cons:While there is a great amount of available plugins, I'd like to see more.Some rudimentary settings such as disabling users from the ability to delete tickets is not available - that should be a simple configuration setting.Better reporting functionality and customization would be appreciated, as there is not a ton of configuration settings around that.Change management functionality would be a huge plus.",,4,4,5,3,5,9,1,0,-1,0,1,0,0,-1,0,0

Freshdesk,Robust Customer Support Management at the best price,"Great. Great. Great. No complaints thus far, save for the slight irritations noted above","After looking at several Support service providers (Zendesk, Salesfoce Desk to name a few). Feature for feature Freshdesk is one the most robust, if not the most robust service, particularly when used in conjunction with Freshworks services like Freshchat. the icing on the cake however is the pricing, the next closest competitor is almost double the price for substantially less features than we have with freshdesk and Freshchat combined. It terms of usage, we have found it easy to work with, easy to customize (except for themeing - addressed in the cons), and easy to integrate into our applicatons and workflows. they have a great mobile app for support on the go and another app for Freshchat to engagee with customers and problems in realtime. Their support team has been extrmely responsive whenever called upon. Great product","1. They lack a robust selection of themes to customize the look and feel of your support portal. Even though customization is a straight forward process once you have your theme files proeprly created,creating them and getting the HTML and javascript components to play nice with the support portal functions is another story. I guess this is however by design as they do have some third party vendors available on their theme page who sell Freshdesk themes (plan on spending about $600 for a decent theme). It would be nice of they had better clear documentation on creating themes for each view and maybe an smart or WSISYG editor which checks for errors.2.

Freshdesk,Best Help Desk System Hands Down,Freshdesk has been an awesome product. It has saved our Technology Department countless hours in documentation and turn around time.It is also easy to setup and get up and running.,The best part of Freshdesk is that it is web based and they have a great mobile app that complements the software. It makes it extremely easy to have access to tickets at all times. They also have great features like canned responses and group ticket assignment. One of my favorite features is the custom ticket fields that can be created and then sorted in the system to give technicians an in depth view based on data like building/location - room/etc. The other huge advantage is that you can try the software for free with a decent amount of base features to see if it will work in your environment. You can then upgrade at anytime and carry your data over with you should you want to add some of the mid tier features. All around it is the best help desk system I have ever used and I have used just about every other vendor out there.,The only thing that I dislike about the software is the collision detection being a premium feature on the two highest packages.

I love the fact that Freshdesk enables us to allow our customers to track their orders at every stage, as Freshdesk's automation allows us to assign an autoresponder to respond to customers, direct them, provide a ticket reference number for follow-up, and also gives us a complete list of customer inquiries.

It is very aesthetically pleasing and easy to find your way around in. I have used it predominantly for lead management with Freshworks CRM, but I have had a glance at other of their solutions my colleagues used and it looked and worked well. They have a great mobile app that takes away the need to use the web version altogether when on the go.","It was a bit hard to properly set up automated tasks as the options provided are very basic. In addition, only one rule can be triggered at a time so one email can't be routed to multiple places using their automation filters. It sometimes created bottlenecks where a filter such as assign conversation to colleague A prevented the send this conversation to the urgent pipeline just because we had to have the first filter above the second for another filter to work properly.

There should be an anchor at the bottom of the screen to jump to top so agents can quickly get back to the top to see the requester's original query. Whilst I'm aware that the keyboard shortcut 'Home' can be used, many users will not know this.* Text formatting requires an extra click on Mint UI to get to the formatting icons such as Bold Link, etc. Previous UI had the text toolbar showing so it only took a single click to say bold text.* Forward icons needs to show on each ticket reply element. The new interface now requires an extra click to a `more' icon to the select `forward. This should be reverted.* When forwarding an email it takes you to the body text area rather than the field above which is the `send to. Additionally, because we use an email signature, the cursor selects at the end of the signature. * Functionality of forum isn't great and the relationship with tickets is poor.",,4,4,5,3,3,,1,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,0

We frequently use the feature to make private notes on tickets, where we can steer who is notified of the note. This helps us find the right person to be responsible for a ticket. Overall, we don't drop the ball anymore by forgetting to reply to a customer, because the request was more tricky or required more insight, and was thus postponed at first.","For the workflow that we follow, the interface is intuitive and easy to use. We can merge tickets easily, find previous communication with the same customer, quickly update the customer's name if the automatic extraction from their email address didn't work so well. I also like that Freshdesk offers a free plan. At first we paid for the service, but then decided that we can do without the extra features for the time being and it was painless to downgrade.Another thing I like is how tickets can quickly be given a certain status at the same time as replying to the customer.","Sometimes I didn't find a function that I was looking for in the admin dashboard.

Freshdesk is perfect for any support team using email or social media to help users. It's flexible enough to become a central element of your online presence once you find your way into the admin section and set up a look and feel that fits your company's style.

So I am very happy my organization chose to stay with Freshdesk.","Ticketing system is absolutely the best feature, it's very flexible and allows for break downs of the types of tickets (call in, email, agent, with additional classifications that you can label yourself). This goes even further into reports and analytics when you need to figure out what kind of tickets are you receiving the most about, which can help create effective business and use cases.Reassigning tickets, the follow ups, monitoring other tickets assigned to other agents automatically because you were tagged init either by note or by providing a response which is very handy. The overall cleanliness of the Freshdesk platform is superb.","only one thing I didn't like is not being able to do batch downloads of files, understandably I was informed that our developers could use the API function to enable batch downloads so at least we have an alternative.",5,5,5,4,,10,1,0,1,0,0,0,-1,1,1,0
Freshdesk,Freshdesk is just Intuitive,Freshdesk has been great.We are able to effectively manage support tickets from over 100 companies with just a few support personnel.,Freshdesk allowed us to enable a customized support portal within hours.The automation and canned responses reduces weekly workload and allows us to focus on improving our products.The customized reports enable me to effectively communicate to my upper management about how we can improve our products.,The gui used to deploy the solution articles could be a little more friendly to use.Formatting the solution articles can sometimes be difficult and I find myself directly editing the HTML to get the desired look.As a admin I would like to be able to edit ticket fields directly from a ticket.,4,5,3,4,4,9,1,1,0,0,0,-1,0,1,0,0
Freshdesk,Freshdesk is simple to use and has all the functionality we need to manage our customer care.,It has created the flexibility we needed to manage our customer care service. It's given us visibility through reporting and insight into the types of issues occurring. It's speeded up our response time and improved our performance with better quality responses.,It's easy to set up and extremely flexible. It enables us to effectively manage our customer care inquiries and prioritise tickets. It links well into other software and social media platforms. Support is always quick & informative. Training programs & help articles are readily available and it allows me to manage our agents performance too. Reporting is simple and functionality like 'canned responses' help to improve our response times. The ability to create customized ticket fields and tags is very useful and also helps with reporting. There are a number of plans to choose from to suit your needs & size. Simple monthly invoicing per user makes it easy to budget for.,I honestly can't think of many cons! The only slight issue I had was not being able to add other options or edit the 'Source' ticket field in Freshdesk but we managed to get around this by simply creating another field option so wasn't really an issue!,5,5,5,5,5,10,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
Freshdesk,The Customer Support Goldmine,Its wonderfull,"Freshdesk is the all in one customer support system. which provides ticket management system, knowledge base, multi channel support system, call features and much more at one place.",Freshdesk is just in begining stage it lacks advanced features so we can't use it for advanced work. but a small business can use it hassle free.,5,5,5,5,5,10,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,-1,1
Freshdesk,Great tool to provide superior customer experience,Pros:Integrations within the Freshworks product suite make things super simple. I liked the smooth integrations with Freshchat and Knowlarity. Freshdesk also provides the API to fetch all the data to push to our internal system. We used that to build our reports on top of Freshdesk.,"Cons:Reporting around ticket management can be improved. We had to build our internal reporting while using Freshdesk. The combined reporting of Freshchat & Freshdesk would have helped a lot as well so that we don't have to look into two different systems.

Freshdesk,Easy communication,We keep track of the requests made by clients by Freshdesk and consistently work on the tickets issued. The responses provided by us are very quick and it satisfies them. We keep checking for any new requirements made by clients and this way we keep time bound for the solutions. Freshdesk makes the communication very smooth.,The most important thing we liked was making of tickets for the calls and they are done with different operating processes. There is good synchronization for the contacts which are automatically saved in the databases. The communication is very smooth which helps us to make clients aware about the things which are achievable and regularly update them about the same. It is very easy to learn and operate.The best thing about this software is that it completely scalable and we can configure it according to our needs. It has some very nice integrations under it's hood.,The migration of system is very hard and we have to do it manually for some tickets to skip the loss. There needs to be makeover for the tickets form. The launching of surveys from the application is not given which can be improved. Also integration with some softwares like Trello is not good.,4,5,5,4,5,9,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,-1,0
Freshdesk,Great Ticket managing system with lots of integrations,Managing and tracking tenant repair issues. The main benefit is we have a full paper trail and seem to always know where we are with our team.,"They have a tonne of integrations possible, and you can set up triggers. With minimal ease we set up an SMS trigger for URGENT tickets. So we get informed when a tenant (we are using this for repairs) raises an urgent ticket. They have an API and you could integrate them fully into your own back-end or customer interface. Really very useful.",So far there hasn't been that much. Initially there was a lot to dislike but over the many years we've used it we've seen them constantly upgrade it to the point where we have an iOs application. This makes it super easy to update tickets while we are out and about on the road.One feature that could be nice is if the software had a kind of a BCC for tickets but it kept all parties in the replies. So the software would keep forwarding responses to other people who didn't get them such that it keeps the original email address private. This would allow us to have property owners and tenants direct on the same ticket and allow us to better utilise the tool,5,5,5,5,5,9,1,1,-1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Freshdesk,FreshDesk is great if you're starting out/ smaller companies,"OVerall we are happy with Freshdesk, esp for the price point, but like most saas softwares they are unbundling things to make more money. Again, we're not against making money in principle but it gets a little tiresome too. We wish the software was a little faster to get to know, but once you do it's pretty easy to use. The customer support has always been helpful, even when we've been frustrated they work with us to solve the problems.","FreshDesk is pretty easy to get started with. It's relatively customizable, although we'd like to see more (esp on the chat function, although they are supposed to be addressing this in coming releases). The dashboard is relatively user friendly once you spend some time with it. The Help Desk/knowledge center is very easy to use.","They recently unbundled their chat software into another product (ugh) but at least they grandfathered us into that price point. So we appreciate that, Freshdesk! But it's really, really, really annoying to have to have two dashboards up and active as a small company to keep them active. It eats our computer cpu and bandwidth by leaving them up and if we want both running, this was a big step backwards in our overall customer support management. :(",4,3,5,4,5,9,1,-1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Freshdesk,FreshDesk Review,We ahve now disabled Direct Email support and now have all tickets directly logged via the web portal which means that end users are now more likely to use the online knowledge-base which means that issues can be resolved faster and provide a better customer experience and fast response time.,Over the year I have used several helpdesk products and I can say that this is one of the best for a small sized business.The look and feel of the software is great and its really easy to use whether your an It professional ora computer novice.The canned responses and knowledge-base make it easy to reply to common issues and build a selfservice module that end users can also search for known issues and resolutions without even have to log support ticket.,Some of the more advanced features are not available to the lower priced modules.,4,4,,4,,9,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,-1,0,0

You can access from your pc, mobile, or simply via email.The history and followup that freshservice holds in one ticket is very helpful to remember some of those long standing requests that I come across.","The filtering and saving views is nice, but I can easily forget which one I'm in.

Freshdesk,Remote Customer Service,Pros:Freshdesk is very easy to use and to train staff on. The program is simply built without a ton of confusing information or unnecessary additions I found the tracking to be sufficient and as a whole it worked well for the company.,Cons:I would have liked to see when staff was online or off and a way to better track who is answering tickets and the length of time it took to answer each of them.,Alternatives Considered:Salesforce Sales Cloud,5,5,4,5,4,8,1,-1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Freshdesk,8 Years of FreshDesk,FreshDesk was an easy to impliment service that empowered our end users and staff to engage the IT Ops and ask other administrative questions effortlessly. Allowing better communication throughout our organization.,The administrative settings are among my favorite aspects of using FreshDesk. Allowing granular control of many features without being overwhelming. Being able to create rules for incoming tickets is an intuitive experiece and initially integrating FreshDesk was an easy experience.,"I can't think of any cons, FreshDesk services and features are above and beyond what I would expect for a product that has a free tier that is feature rich.",5,5,5,5,5,10,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0
Freshdesk,The customer service solution for everybody,"We are a small company, it took us a afternoon to setup a free plan and a customer support portal. After 3 years all our customers are posting their issues to the portal, we can alternate three people in replying, all issues are kept track of with the entire history (that was getting lost in several email chains with different people before Freshdesk). At the end of the year we get some basic statistics about how good we have been in respecting SLA. We can divide tickets by customer, product, etc. We are evaluating to upgrade because the other plans are still cheap and are much richer of statistics and channels.","There is a plan for each size of company, from free for small companies like us that enjoy a fully functional platform without any cost and with minimal learning curve to very complete multisite, multiteam platform that is not expensive for a huge organisation.Any other software or solution costs more.It is fully open for customization and foresees all that you can imagine and more for bringing the best customer support to your clients.",Nothing worth even mentioning.

We are a smaller company so menuevering the tickets isn't overwhelming and the website provides helpful tools that save tons of time.,"Our launch of FreshDesk was seamless! I was able to maneuver the website to become familiar with it and customize our ticketing system within a few days. My favorite features are the easy to generate ticket integration with FreshSales, real-time ticket updates, and the ability to draft canned responses for common issues.","I would love a better integration feature with FreshSales. It should be able to sync the company, contacts, and deals rather than just the contacts. This creates extra work recording the extra information and makes the ease of generating a ticket from FreshSales obsolete.

It works well, our project manager can assign tickets to various people on our team, add notes, add attachments, and then we can send the final files to the client. For this purpose, it works great.","When people respond to tickets they aren’t always matched up to the ticket and instead creates a new ticket. The file transfer limit is understandable, but if the file name is too long (or has identifying numbers or names at the end of the name) it will give you the error, but it is hard to discern which files are not attached.

It feels klunky compared to the ease of drafting and sending emails from Outlook.The way emails are formatted in tickets is also confusing.

It has been a fantastic tool because it has helped streamline my workflow and I have received quality customer support every step of the way.

Freshdesk,FreshDesk - they've nailed the basics and it's continuing to get better...,Pros:Overall Freshdesk has nailed the UI/UX design and basics of a support system.Most controls are intuitive and the setup is a breeze.I like that contacts are automatically created with each email sent to the mail listener.The API was easy to use (for extracting ticket detail to local reports).The SLA configuration is simple.The flexibility in email notifications and format for the various help desk communication scenarios is very well done. The software does a good job tracking threads and appending to work orders (without the annoying tag in the email subject line).I first used the software in 2016; they were missing parent/child tickets at that time; they've added it.,"Cons:1) I wish the agent collision detection used AI/ML to detect potential duplicate tickets or merge opportunities 2) the main ticket screen does not scale/reformat to larger monitor sizes well.In short, if you like to see a lot of columns, it requires scrolling regardless of screen resolution. 3) several of the built-in ticket fields cannot be removed.",,4,5,5,4,5,10,1,-1,1,1,0,0,1,0,-1,0

Freshdesk,Regrettable decision,"The only benefit we really get from Fresh Desk is a system to track new tickets.Older ones were migrated poorly, nothing is searchable by text, there is no support from their team, and we have frequent performance degradation issues.

The link text does not match the hyperlink itself.* Support is non-existent.Issues go on for years (literally, in some cases) without being addressed, despite assurances they are being fixed.* The transition process was a nightmare. We were six months behind schedule, and the conversion was sloppy.* There have been frequent service outages and degradation in performance in the brief time we've been with them. We have not experienced this level of performance with any other vendor.* Calls are not returned, agents are impossible to reach, and we are extremely dissatisfied with the entire experience.We are actively searching for a new vendor already, and we have had it for less than 7 months.",1,3,1,2,1,,1,-1,1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0

It's easy to respond to clients when the email in. Everything is clear and having required fields helps make reporting nice an easy. Overall I've been quite happy with the software and the rapid responses of the support team.,"Some things aren't always easy or intuitive. Like if a client chats in and enters their email wrong then you try to correct it in the contact and business details later to make sure it's associated with the right business and tickets aren't lost you have to just try to merge the contacts but then you have a random email address hanging out etc.Outbound emails to clients can be tricky since you need to either create a ticket first or send an email and enter the ticket details at the bottom [which is decent and close] but you can't just be in a contact page and hit send email and have it go to that client. Thus you have to copy their email address then go to a new email and paste the email address into the search bar for where it's going. Little things like that just make it a little less intuitive. Sometimes responses to emails, where multiple people are on the thread will come in as new tickets instead of part of that ticket and you have to merge them.",4,4,4,4,4,9,1,-1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,-1

Freshdesk,"Very easy to learn how to navigate and use this tool, New Mint UI looks clean and amiable.","Pros:I personally find User Interface (Mint version) is very clean and amiable:It helps when the UI is refined down to the essentials - what functions I use most, and the places I need to go, are often no more than 1 or 2 clicks away, which is always appreciated. A clean, sharp UI helps save time and removes distractions helping to maintain focus on the task at hand.The aesthetics for the Mint UI is also very amiable, making use of a simple/soft colour tone - I use Freshdesk daily, so it really helps to find what I look at pleasing.","Cons:The general lack of customisation at the user level:For example, when updating ticket properties, if I could choose to have certain options in the drop down list highlighted for visibility, or have even better, choose to have some ticket propertiesdefaulted to a certain option, it would save a lot of time.Another suggestion for customisation would be if I could tag Agents to be of a certain group - From there I could send a private note to the tagged group and it would notify the tagged agents in that group, (instead of adding them to the recipient list 1 by 1).The small things all count towards the user experience after all",,4,5,4,4,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0

It's great that customers can email the support system directly rather than an individual, so that all requests are centralized.","Features that would improve the functionality of the ticketing system would be the ability to add tasks, or convert messages in the ticket to tasks that could be checked off when done, the ability to assign a ticket to multiple people, and I haven't quite figured out why when some people reply to a ticket email the ticket owner gets an email notification, but not when others reply--it makes it inconvenient to have to periodically check the ticket for replies.

Freshdesk,Freshdesk fab for member management,We started using Freshdesk in 2020 when we needed a tech based solution to fielding a number of enquiries relating to COVID in the workplace.Freshdesk was easy to set-up and we had a system in place in a matter of days with users assigned to different levels of permissions.It meant that we were able to respond quickly and effectively to thousands of enquiries that otherwise would have been chaos on a shared outlook inbox.,"The ability to set up “canned responses” was so useful for us as an organisation as we were able to set up draft replies to common questions making our response time even better.I also like the automations and rules that you can set up to do X Id Y happens.

Freshdesk,Very impressed,"Pros:I love using Freshdesk. We evaluated 3 top-tier customer support management system products to manage our complex array of products and Freshdesk was the clear winner on functionality and price. While it's true, one of the contenders could have met our needs a tiny bit better. The price tag was 8x higher than Freshdesk.That's not a joke. From the moment I saw Freshdesk, I loved the simplistic design of the site. It reflects how they do all of their development. Features are added gracefully and in ways I don't always expect. For example, we had major problems with multiple agents working on the same ticket.Freshdesk added a very simple indicator that shows icons detailing that someone else is looking at that same ticket. It's very subtle, but very effective. All of their features are focused on high-usability, without cluttering the screen with additional controls. It reminds me of how Apple does UI. It's simple and elegant.","Cons:While it has a great deal of flexibility, there are some things that an off-the-shelf product will never deliver. We have a laundry list of things we would love to see in the product, but it seems the development direction is going off in a different direction. We have solved a lot of problems using their development API, but now we have a decent-sized code base that requires maintenance and attention, from time to time. The other thing that has been difficult is the Freshdesk follows a typical customer support model where agents might be encouraged to compete with each other.That's not a philosophy we believe in, in our environment. It's not that big of a deal, but we would prefer if all of the agent comparisons were kept hidden.

I like that I could set up a knowledge base. There is a 21 day trial period so you have time to see if the software will work for your business.,"Because it is a simpler help desk software with quick implementation, that means it does have its limits and it’s not very dynamic.

I appreciate this software doing exactly what it's supposed to do, without any unnecessary distractions, bugs or issues. After all, thepoint of the platform is to get me in touch with the person who can help me with my problem. I don't really care about the medium I use to do it--so long as it works!

And that's the biggest compliment, because it means it's doing its job seamlessly and the design is not getting in the user's way.

Freshdesk,CRM that's really functional,"It has been a good experience overall.It has its pros and cons, it's fast, easy, full of fabulous and really useful features. However, if you're a non-technical person and try to this DIY the customization is really tough if by any chance you're unlucky to get a not so great account manager there.","We took the Estate plan with Omnichannel option. This integrated all our social media handles as well, it's almost an ORM for a cost of CRM. It's intuitive, fast and easy. Even non-technical people can get it up and running in no time.","It's full of features like bots, fresh calls etc,however, that's a really tough thing to set up.

Freshdesk,Good Helpdesk support tool,"Pros:Freshdesk is very easy to use and the support team appreciated a lot the fact that no extensive training is needed to start to use the tool. In general, is very easy to work with the different channels without struggle.The set up of the platform is also very simple and allows you to personalise not only te views and groups but your advice metrics (SLA)","Cons:Freshdesk has reporting tools that covers basic aspects of the helpdesk business but I did not find it that great as other competitors when requesting customized (more advanced) reports. For multibrand ecommerce businesses this is a big need as we need to respond to different clienta needs/requests.

Freshdesk,Easy to Use Ticket System,"I'm not currently using this software in the company I'm working at right now, but I do think from my previous experience using 2 ticket softwares that Freshdesk has a visually appealing UI and most times has no issues. Even though I didn't use all the integrations it has with other platforms, I'm aware my coworkers were happy with the ease of use.","It's easy to use, even though it has many options present, it doesn't confuses you. I liked the filter system, which automatically detected ticket correlation to other tickets. This helps you to trace back issues or to verify if the current request has been dealt with before. I didn't use the reporting/analytics feature but my peers were very happy with the integration it has with PowerBi, since they needed to visualize KPIs.","I constantly ran into a bug that re opened the tickets I closed, it was a random behavior so it was annoying to figure out there were tickets from months ago re opened that affected the KPIs of customer service representatives. There's also another random bug that, when replying to a ticket, the system removed the recipient (user that created the ticket) from the list of emails when responding which was frustrating.

Could have better adjustment of SLAs and metrics.",Flexibility and ease of use when it came to setup and adjusting to whatever level of support WE want to offer and how. Adjustment of SLAs and thresholds is easy.,Support is a little unavailable and heavily scripted.

Ability to update and adjust some metrics is marginal.,4,4,3,4,4,8,1,0,0,1,-1,0,-1,0,1,0
Freshdesk,Easy to use and understand,"Pros:The unique thing which Freshdesk offers and others do not is that they offer the ability to forward a ticket/conversation to a third person (outside your organization and agents) without letting the requester of the ticket know. I have not found this functionality in any other helpdesks I have used so far. Also, their support is very responsive and puts every bit of their knowledge to solve the issues.",Cons:Reporting can be improved since they are very limited and you have to export an excel file of tickets received to create manual reports.,,3,4,5,3,5,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0,0
Freshdesk,Excellent ticketing system.,"Really positive feedback from the team and clients. If a client called up, it was easy to write up the comments and issues they were experiencing and then assign the tickets to team members to deal with. Really sped up our response times.","Freshdesk is great. It was very easy to set up, super easy to use and the clients that reported issues never had an issue submitting tickets. I used Freshdesk while I was working in the education sector in the UK. Teachers do not have time to report issues so if the system was cumbersome or hard or not intuitive they simply wouldn't report. The fact they did so often is testament to the platform's ease of use.","I can't think of a con at the moment, I am trying to get my current employer to switch over to Freshdesk!",5,5,5,4,5,9,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Freshdesk,FreshDesk Review,Within FreshDesk I solve technical problems for our clients here at Consult & Design. If there is an issue with a clients website an email will come into Freshdesk and here it will be dealt with as FreshDesk is our Support Central. I really enjoy using FreshDesk and use it daily with ease - great software.,I like the available options for customizing your emails such as the formatting options allowing you to write certain parts of emails in itallic or bold when you are trying to bring attention to a certain section of the email. I also think that the FreshDesk stastic analyst is also a great feature for tracking customer service levels.,"I don't like how you have to log into the site twice before reaching your account, this seems unnecessary and too long of a process.",5,5,3,4,4,8,1,0,0,0,0,1,-1,1,0,0
Freshdesk,Excellent for multi-product brands,"Pros:My favorite part of Freshdesk is that it is the best tool (and definitely most affordable) to support multi-product brands. That is, if BrandA has ProductB and ProductC and ProductD and you want to filter tickets (and specifically TITLE them -- in the email subject line -- for the products they represent), you can do so easily with Freshdesk. Zendesk requires a higher tier payment plan for the same functionality, and the smaller/newer helpdesk services don't support this type of feature. Their support is very accessible and they will go the extra mile to ensure you get supported. They will even help with some development to some extent even if it falls outside the scope of the project.","Cons:The team is abroad and not US-based, which is limiting sometimes in terms of accessibility of getting things resolved. There are sometimes delays when it comes to implementation of some features and functionality. Like Salesforce, you have to create a user for a Freshdesk service representative to log into your system and see if things are working.",,4,4,4,4,4,9,1,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,1
Freshdesk,Punch the tickets with Freshdesk,"In terms of managing the tickets, I have found Fresh desk very reliable, because sometimes one of our agents is working on the tick and if he gets stuck the other agents has the access to desk with that, so no compromise is done on our client’s services. I am very happy with its services.",Freshdesk is an effective channel for providing great customer services. It helps me managing multiple stores and providing responsive services to my clients. It is multi dimensional tool that provides advanced kind of emailing services. I would say it provides excellent services for collaboration and providing professional support to our customers.,"I do not have anything to dislike about Freshdesk, it is going well and providing the best services.",5,5,4,5,5,10,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
Freshdesk,Best Cloud Software for Digital Marketing,Overall expersience of the Freshdesk is out of the box it helps in various CRM and customer support system but it could have been better in the pricing system so that it could be more easily accessible and affordable,Frsshdesk is one of the best digital marketing and customer support app it allows us to create and manage various tickets at various times. It notonly provides live chat it also helps in transfering the live chat to a phone assistance officer easily.,Freshdesk is great but it could have been cheaper so that it can be affordable by the various small scale industries and as well as by the startups.Sometimes the ticket system slows down due to usage of multiple sources at the same time,4,5,4,4,4,8,1,-1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
Freshdesk,Freshdesk is a usefool tool to manage tickets raised by the Clients,"Pros:Freshdesk is very much appropriate for an organisation which has a huge Client Base. The Dashboard of Freshdeskgives a overall picture to the agents who are resolving the tickets on How many are Pending and how many are resolved. This has a creative and User friendly Interface Customers can raise the tickets in an easy manner and also customers would be able to track their ticket status and also comment on them. It is a beneficial tool for both customer and business in sorting out an Issue. The agents would also feel convenient in keeping track in the tickets. The Tickets goes exactly to the relevant Clusters. Freshdesk provides the feature of adding a comment before closing the ticket, this gives the notification to all the other team members that the ticket is closed. It also gives an overall graphical representation of the tickets which would give a trend on theTickets Received, so the agents would get an idea and cater to the tickets accordingly.",Cons:It is better if there is a different separation for High Priority List and Normal List for Tickets Raised. It is much more convincing if Freshdesk would be able to collaborate with other social media and other Apps.,,5,4,,5,4,9,1,0,1,-1,1,0,0,0,-1,1
Freshdesk,Good for the basics...,"It gets the job done, but for the price I would not personally recommend this. Searching for anything in there is a complete nightmare and I just think there's probably better options for this price range.","- customized helpdesk for your own business (SLA rules, group filters, custome URL and forums)- have experienced almost no downtime- you can tie it in with other solutions like JIRA- close customer support tickets without a notification going to them ;)",- the new 'mint' view is a huge pain- searching is a joke. dont even bother trying.- support agent statistics are almost never accurate.,3,3,5,2,3,3,-1,0,0,1,0,0,-1,0,1,0

It is possible to survey the productivity of technicians throughout the day. Through it, it is possible to receive immediate feedback of the service performed, making it possible to always improve the performance of the service provided. Old tickets can be easily located, if necessary. Another good point is that if multiple people are solving a single problem, it is possible to know which person is contributing information to remedy the problem.","I think it should be possible to customize the software.

Freshdesk,Have used it since I did support myself and still use it with a team,"Pros:Freshdesk has done a great job of expanding its capabilities since I started using it over a year ago. You can tell the team behind it is passionate about making support suck less and is trying to create as many tools as they can as fast as possible to make our lives easier. They've added live chat, a mobile support sdk, and embedded widgets just recently and they're not slowing down. I've dealt with their support as well and they're fast to reply and really know how to solve problems.That said, they haven't lost touch with what I came to them for, ticketing. Freshdesk handles tickets and support team access to those like pros. Canned responses, reminders, contact","Cons:The UI of the admin interface is a bit dated and ugly, therefore the same with the customer portals. We don't use the portals externally, though, so it's not a huge issue for us. One issue I had due to lack of explanation within the software was that deleted contacts also block all incoming emails (auto archives) from those contacts without warning, so don't delete any!

Freshdesk,"An Awesome, Affordable Starting Place","I've been using Freshdesk on and off at various ventures over the past three years. I find that it is a great place to begin adding support for your services if you don't already have support, as it is easy to set up and offers all the minimums you need to get rolling at their free tier. I found that is was great for handling between 0 - 250 requests per day with a few agents, however it got clunkier as we tried to scale this approach toward 500-1000 requests/day. The main issues that we ran into were UI complexity and constantly having to jump around to get things done - whether that was referencing a customer's information in detail or jumping between conversations. It is also important to note that their embeddable support widgets are not the best looking, but their API makes up for it - I strongly recommend you write your own front-end components for this if you intend to operate at scale.Overall, Freshdesk offers a great starting place of you don't have any support service in place and I think it will serve most small to medium companies perfectly.",,,4,3,5,4,5,8,1,-1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

If multiple people are logged into one account it is annoying that you can't see who is answering which ticket, but otherwise no problems.",5,5,,5,,9,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
Freshdesk,Help Desk Ticket Solution,"Pros:We migrated from Zendesk to FreshDesk for better pricing and additional features. FreshDesk was a fresh, welcome change from ZD convoluted UI. It was easier to make our way around FreshDesk and it almost started feeling like a CRM where we could access full histories of customers. We loved the API and it's ability to integrate with our various systems.",Cons:Reports needs a lot of help.

Freshdesk,Personal thoughts,"8/10Optimized performance Amazing mobile app Chat support replies fast enough User friendly interface A lot of managing tools, abilities, etc.","Mobile application, the way it worked, amazing performance, user friendly, it was easy to manage small amount of tickets by this mobile version.

Freshdesk,Switched from UserVoice and do not regret it!,"Using it for over 2 years now and when we have an issue, support is fast and helpful.","Excellent support, custom pricing and flexibility to enable certain features from a more expensive plan without switching to the plan. The discount you get, is kept forever, even for new agents.

Freshdesk,Overall it is a great ticketing software.

I would be lost without Freshdesk. It's exactly what I've been looking for. I don't always clap, but when I do, it's because of Freshdesk. The CRM integration imports contacts directly from our CRM system for easy access to customer information.","When configuring some of the deeper customization features, it can sometimes be tricky to find the setting for what you are trying to configure.

Freshdesk,Taking our Customer Service to the next level,"Pros:The FreshDesk product is exactly what our small company needed to manage our ever-growing support needs.Our company offers two product lines, and having the option to structure help and solutions and forums into product-specific help portals was a huge benefit.In addition, I found the user interface throughout FreshDesk to be extremely user-friendly, even when diving into some fairly complex setup options for auto-handling our incoming inquiries.Because of our success with FreshDesk we recently added FreshSales to our toolset, and are thrilled with the integration and sharing of information our sales and support personnel are now experiencing.","Cons:Our dev team utilizes Azure DevOps as its management tool and while we did explore a 3rd party solution for integrating FreshDesk to DevOps, we found it had limitation in automatically syncing information 2-ways.Offering a more robust integration to DevOps would be an added bonus. However,given the custom configuration options freshdesk presents, we were easily able to work around this and do not find it to be a deal breaker by any means.",,5,5,5,5,5,10,1,-1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

After searching for a while, I found Freshdesk, which was by far the best option with the best price. It's automated response system was one of my favorite features.

We want our warehouse/account team to be involved on the Freshdesk for the internal communication. We have 2 support users, 1 account user and 3 warehouse users. What is the point of paying the cost for 6 users when we need 2 support users to communicate to our customers?- We get an average of 500 tickets per month and we need lots of users. Freshdesk offers unlimited tickets, but limit users. which is opposite to our requirement budget.- Slow Technical Support, most of the times I get a reply from the tech. support after 5-8 hours and no live chat available.- eBay is not available on the lower pricing plans but strangely Amazon is available on the lowest pricing plan.",5,5,4,5,3,8,-1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

Zendesk,Worst Support in Industry,"The service before the sale was exceptional. However, we found out too late that the service we purchased is not the service we were shown.

The live chat has cut down on our overall customer support time, however the setup was more difficult and the maintenance is more difficult than other solutions. Most of the features that we like either don't operate on all versions of Zendesk or they only work about half of the time.","The mobile app is almost unusable. But nothing is as bad as their support after the sale. You will get the excellent communication before the sale and you will be shown every feature Zendesk offers, but after the sale you will find out that there is no way to contact a human for support and all of the features that they showed you are not included and cost ridiculous amounts more.

The back-end user experience is the greatest I've ever encountered. The integration of Shopify and the capturing of knowledge is effortless.

Zendesk,"Great software, terrible support (ironically); Hope you don't have to leave","Our company has been using Zendesk for 5-7 years. I was not personally around when we onboarded it, but I have worked with it for over 3 years now. We have terrible trouble any time we did need support, for a system problem or a question we couldn't answer ourselves via their expansive maze of KnowledgeBase. The support reps at Zendesk have been accusatory, excuse-ridden, and most of all don't even read the tickets you submit to understand the problem (Zendesk support actually became an office joke. That's about the time we decided we had to look for another tool). When we met with our Account Rep to try to get some of the issues worked out, we were told basically that we weren't even supposed to have gotten the level of support we had received, and proceeded to explain how SaaS works (we're a software company, mind you). I think Zendesk simply got too big too fast, and somewhere along the way decided that the businesses using their product aren't important anymore. They lost this long-term customer.","Zendesk as a tool does what it is supposed to do, and it does it well. We used Support + Guide products, for ticketing for our e-learning business, and also for our Self-Serve support (knowledgebase). It is full-featured, and comprehensive. As far as support rep work goes, it's simple, to the point, and it integrates well with many tool because it is such a large company. It is designed for an enterprise company.","Because it is so full-featured, it can be years' work to get everything set like you need, and they provide little to no assistance. Some of the basic settings are so deep and so spread out, you'll spend hours reading through Help articles to understand how to customize your ticket form.

Zendesk,Modern customer facing companies need a modern customer facing solution,Pros:The format of the ticket interface lends its self to serving email based communications very well. At a glance I can easily see all tickets sent by a specific requester or business and prioritize based on the severity of the issues being described. The help center and chat button that can be integrated into custom applications can be a game changer when it comes to self service. Inbound and outbound call recordings are super critical especially for our finance team to ensure we have a reliable means of keeping proof of what was said.,"Cons:The cost is ever increasing while they shift features away from lower tiers and pay wall them behind more expensive tiers of their service. We used to have rich analytics with Gooddata. Since they moved to building their own analytics add in a company has to be at a minimum tier of Zendesk and then purchase the Explore add in. From there someone needs to familiarize themselves with the add in service and create the data sets they need. Zendesk's own support team's response time has become abysmal. It takes weeks to hear back from anyone despite adding words like urgent critical time sensitive in the subject line and the body. If you're get a response, you just hope it's comprehensive enough to solve the problem on the first try, but more often than not the support agents miss the point or gloss over the issue and provide a support article that doesn't help solve the issue.

Having more extensive customization options would greatly benefit businesses, as it would allow us to align the software more closely with our branding and specific requirements. This level of customization would help create a consistent and personalized experience for our customers.","The best feature of Zendesk Suite is the integration of multiple tools into a single platform.

For example, when creating business rules, you cannot use the AND and OR function, it's either AND or OR per one business rule. When utilizing Zendesk for internal use, Zendesk still lacks lots of functions such as conversation history, child-ticket, and etc. Even though some of them are already available on Zendesk Marketplace, these add-ons should be free rather than asking us to pay extra for them. Also, the technical customer support is not that useful. Zendesk pride in having 24-hours technical customer support when compared to competitors but out of 10 cases that I asked for, only 1 or 2 cases the technical customer support could help me. Most of the time, our team fixed the issue by ourselves.",5,5,3,4,5,9,1,-1,0,-1,-1,1,0,1,1,1
Zendesk,A lot of features and fast and easy to use ticket system,"Zendesk is the most customizable ticket system in the market, a lot of features that can help to automate things. Plus you can also install apps that could be useful.","Zendesk has a lot of features, and customizable templates, it's not that easy to use as other CRM, so it may required traning, however this is because the highly customizable settings, and options the products offers.It's really easy to answer 100 tickets at the same time, using templates that will show the client's name and information, Overall a really good product, a bit expensive, but it offers a lot of features which makes the product a good product and good benefit.",It can be very complex/difficult at certain point due all the features that they offer.,5,3,5,5,4,10,1,-1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
Zendesk,A living nightmare,"I've used Zendesk in all of the ventures I've participated in. Unfortunately. I get it that in 2012 it was an easy option, but today there are plenty more and plenty of options of building out solutions yourself if customer support means everything to you.","Sticking to Zendesk is very easy. Open a free account, plug in your email and you are off. Thats the reason this company is such a popular customer support software. Start off frictionlessly and you won't ever be able to stick away from them. That doesn't mean they are a good solution.","As soon as you want to build some sophisticated solutions with ANY digital company in 2021 requires from day one, you will face two things: 1) Advertised features for enterprise plans which don't actually exist, or are a euphemism of what one can understand. I.E. a sandbox environment. We literally got told it didn't exist after we hired enterprise chat. 2) A terrible - terrible is the word, I honestly don't like to speak poorly in public of anyone, but you guys deserve this post - customer support. Despite having an account manager, I have probable been referred to sign up on my own for multiple register forms for products, and speak to multiple agents to sign SO to commit to payments... and the product was NEVER delivered. Once they have you committed to a payment, they won't follow up for success.",1,2,1,4,3,,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1
Zendesk,Stay Away,"Customer support is terrible, they do have an unqualified customer success team. We requested a feature and it took them over 5 months with emails back and forth to let us know they can get it done. When i tried to cancel the contract they said we can not cancel it because you have another 1 year on a contract which was incorrect. the success manager was still thinking we are in 2019 after i pointed that out they still refused to cancel the contract. My advice to this company is a legacy and you should look into a more modern system and there is alot of them out there.","At first, we liked using them, we had no issues with their system until they started adding extra products that were not native. for instance, their chat app slowed down our website by at least 30%, we tried intercom and immediately had positive feedback from our users.",Their chat software will consume the life out of your website performance.,1,1,1,3,1,,0,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,1
Zendesk,Recommended if you have high volumes of support tickets,"While there are a couple of issues with Zendesk, overall I find it a far preferable option to dealing with these tickets through e-mail, Slack, or a personal basis (barring cases where this would be the better solution). If you are getting enough volume of tickets that support ticket software seems like it'd help your business, you can afford to get it.","Gives you a central hub to handle support tickets (in my case, internal). Rather than handling issues faced by colleagues through e-mail or a chat program, thus, cluttering either up, you can sort it all away into a separate place. It usefully has both e-mail notification and Slack integration abilities, which means beingaware right away when an issue is sent in. It also has the ability to link tickets from JIRA, so if an issue requires additional intervention from other teams, you now have that connection. Also useful is if you have some desire for anonymity (obscure/black box who specifically is handling issues), this will work far better than e-mail or Slack in providing that. There are also additional features such as stats and metrics, along with the ability to add tags to tickets, required fields, and macros to automate certain workflows. Again, if you are working extensively with handling issues of all manners, you will find Zendesk quite useful for you.","While the software does a good job of providing a central hub for managing support tickets, it has a couple of improvement points. The ability to not reopen a ticket if someone is simply thanking you would be nice, and one that has been requested a while that has never been implemented. Navigating the help center where you can write articles is a bit confusing to navigate and requires specific flows to get to view vs edit mode. Furthermore, the formatting tools you are offered for creating articles are quite limited, clunky, and awkward. If you want to write anything other than very bland and simple text, you'd be better off linking to an external site with better options, such as Google Docs.",4,4,,4,,8,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,-1,1
Zendesk,"Communicate effectively with your customers, ¡Use Zendesk!","Zendesk, has helped me to perform better the solution of any problem that our clients may have, has given us the possibility of creating automatic responses, through different forms of communication, thus, it has made my work so fast and easy. Its reporting function is also really very beneficial, to see what the trends are, in sending emails to our dissemination team. Zendesk, has a great possibility to gradually increase the functions of our companies, helping us to move towards success, in a reliable and safe way.","Zendesk, is a reliable application, your ticket collection and autocomplete form is always available. In addition, it helps us resolve inquiries about calls, through your help in responding to the distinctive clientele of different media channels, and having them move through help guides before they can engage in a conversation with managers. I like Zendesk because its tools are necessary for effective management towards the guest, they facilitate the alternation of emails and take internal notes, in addition to recording telephone calls and voice memos are only for employee use. All your tools are vital to manage the accounts of our customers. It is highly recommended, a satisfied customer is one more achievement.","The main drawback of this skillful application, is that its long-lasting features and simple to implement, are requested by customers through the community, are not added to the product, the user interface is not one of the most attractive that exist , although it presents all the functionalities implemented at the same time, so enough time is spent to fully familiarize yourself with this software and make the most of its performance. Several changes can further improve workflows or provide better interaction between the company and the clientele. Your online training is not the most complete because you do not have fasting forums or personal training. There is no free trial available to test the software before you are told to opt for a paid plan with all available features.",5,5,5,5,5,10,1,1,-1,0,0,0,1,1,-1,1
Zendesk,Market Leader in Ticketing Software (Probably),"Overall, Zendesk allowed us to create a new ticketing platform and process for the business. Its integration with Slack drove great user adoption and encouraged submissions. This platform allowed us to report on the most common IT and biz ops issues at our org while allowing agents to service and help the team effectively. It's pretty ideal that you can manage your workload, triage requests, and reply to folks all in a few clicks. It's really all-in-one if you integrate with your CRM too.","Top features for me in this tool were the GoodData reporting flexibility, ticket automation, and clean user experience. We didn't leverage the knowledge base, although being able to click to directly create an article after a ticket submission seemed like a slick feature. The ability to add lots of custom fields of varying types, create automation based on those fields, and rout tickets to end users was key. There's great flexibility in what you can achieve between the user permissions, user groups, and the form/landing page as part of the tool.","Some of the out of the box reporting seemed a little bit wonky in comparison with what I would pull in the GoodData insights area. Honestly, very few cons about Zendesk, although the price is a bit steep for a ticketing platform. This being said, though, it's very powerful and you get what you pay for with software.",5,4,4,5,3,9,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,-1,1,0
Zendesk,Zendesk - Robust Ticketing Software,We used Zendesk at 3 of my last 4 jobs. The last 2 at my suggestion. We handle a diverse amount of different customer issues and its a great system to manage and track all the different interactions our customers are having as well as the agents that are handling them.,The ticketing platform was much easier to use than our antiquated ticketing service we used. I like the different options and features that Zendesk has vs some of the other companies out there.,"The interface is a little tricky if you have not used it before. So unless you have a diverse knowledge of ticketing software the hill can be a little hard to climb at first, but once you do its smooth sailing from there.",5,5,3,5,4,8,1,0,1,0,1,-1,0,1,0,0
Zendesk,Easy Inter-team Communication and Customer History,"I can't stress enough how easy Zendesk makes it to pass tickets back and forth between people and teams. My team gets a constant flow of tickets and we are able to keep them organized by time, urgency and topic. All customer emails and voicemails that are incoming to my department are received in Zendesk and it's very simple to either respond or make a note and pass along the ticket to the correct person. Zendesk contributes enormously to my company's efficiency and overall organization.","Zendesk allows my team (the accounts receivable team) to work seamlessly with the customer support team. On a daily basis, we pass tickets back and forth to accomplish both simple and more difficult tasks for our customers. The majority of our customer emails, voicemails and recorded calls are logged in Zendesk, so it's easy to search the history of any given customer to find out what they have contacted us about and who helped them. Zendesk makes it super simple to switch back and forth between emailing and making internal notes. A single ticket can contain customer-facing communication, a phone call recording and employee-only notes, all of which are vital to managing our customer accounts.","There are really only two things I don't like about Zendesk. First, I don't care for how it looks when two or more tickets are merged together. Instead of logging emails and notes from oldest to newest like a chain of events, Zendesk collapses one ticket into the other and you have to open both to see everything. It's just a little difficult to understand visually. Second, my company used to use a similar system called Help Scout and it was able to tell us when a customer had opened an email from us. Zendesk is not able to do that.",4,4,,4,,6,1,0,-1,0,1,0,-1,0,0,1
Zendesk,It's what everybody's doing,"Overall, Zendesk makes customer service more efficient. As a manager, I'm able to see my employees satisfaction ratings, how long they spent that day answering emails, how long it takes them in general to answer an email, how long they spent on the phone, etc. Zendesk has been great in streamlining my customer service team while also optimizing the customer's experience.","Seems like Zendesk is the go-to for any e-commerce site these days. I wish there was another company that had the same amount of features and functionalities as zendesk does but I haven't found one. The chat widget is easy to implement and I like the option to have the help functionality act as a buffer between the customer and chat- we have the customer first try to find the answer to whatever question they have by searching our help articles. Then, if they can't find the answer they're looking for there, they can choose to chat with a live agent. This helps our customer service agents get the most out of their time- they're not chatting answering obvious questions that can be found all over our website (for the most part..).","What I like least about Zendesk is the automated your ticket is open and your ticket is closed functionality. This confuses customers a lot. We will close a ticket (email chain) and then zendesk automatically sends out to the customer a separate email that says hour request is now closed. This really confuses customers- especially older ones. They'll send us a separate email saying what request? what is closed and we have to explain it to them, and then close the ticket again, thus sending the same your request is now closed email to them. Sometimes it's an endless circle.",5,5,5,4,4,8,1,-1,1,0,0,1,-1,1,0,0
Zendesk,A mediocre product that doesn't get better as it grows,"Pros:I struggle to find good things to say. It works and rarely has performance problems. If you need very basic support ticketing and are just starting out, you could use it and be successful. We did. But the functionality and support for those organizations between startup and large corporation is nil. If we were a very large organization, I could see it being a valuable product.","Cons:1. It is incredibly difficult to keep track of business users. When you are a SaaS supporting clients who have end-users, organizing tickets and documenting issues is very important to find patterns. This is not possible in Zendesk, at least at the Team feature level. There is not a central location for information for an organization outside of a Notes box that is basically a tiny sidebar textbox that allows no formatting to make notes over time readable.2. There is no way to reference individual comments in a ticket because individual comments do not have their own IDs. This makes it very cumbersome to keep succinct notes and refers back to my first point. The only way we can review a client's history is through wading through a bunch of tickets with an endless stream of comments. I can't get a good timeline overview of their experience and issues, which is so essential to good issue triage. 3. Lack of features for those at the less pricey levels is pretty bad. There's no way to make our contact forms more customizable (like having a message to the person on the ticket - there is only limited description area and those are question/field based) and we don't have access to conditional logic on the forms. So we are left with clients just throwing issues at us without getting good information from them to get a one-touch resolution. The way Zendesk works it forces us to give lower-quality support.4. There's no exporting your ticket information or running any sort of report if you are using the Team or lower feature level. These, to me, should be basic features as they pertain to the most basic of needs for any support team. Not only that, it ties you to the product and punishes you for leaving. We can't move to another product because we can't take our ticket history with us.5. The features and performance is inconsistent. For example, there are Triggers and Automations. Triggers and automations are the same. The only difference is the automations are time-based. But they don't tell you that in the interface - there's nothing telling you what is required to set up the automation in order for it to pass validation, only an error message. And by following the instructions of the error message, you can still get more errors. But there's nothing there to tell you the overall requirements so you can avoid errors in the first place. And in the Triggers interface, they leave out a large amount of placeholder options for seemingly no reason, so you have to go find the placeholder references for yourself. In my opinion, Zendesk doesn't have the user in mind. They put out new features and integrations, but the core product is so severely lacking that it seems like they feel they are operating on auto-pilot and their product needs no update itself. It's a shame, because it was probably was a good product with a lot of potential back when it first started up.",,1,2,,2,1,,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,0
Zendesk,Quick and easy implementation to my Support Center,"Zendesk is an easy-to-use, dynamic, intuitive customer service tool that allows the use of macros to optimize messages to customers.Zendesk is easy to implement and with adaptable prices. I have recommended this tool to several friends for their organizations","Zendesk is an excellent tool for the management of requirements or requests. It facilitates the management within my Support Center.It allows to automate response to our customers. Also, customize the tool according to the type of company.From this tool I manage to serve the internal and external clients of my organization. As well as, send satisfaction surveys once the support is finished.Their specific user roles allowed me to implement the tool in the organization in a short time, even without investing much time in training because it has very good material for users on the web.What I like most about Zendesk is to be able to automate the responses to clients and macros.Zendesk has elements for case management, live chat, design a knowledge base, have a panel to the client. Since we included this tool in the company we have improved our response levels in the support tickets and with this to customer service.I like the flexibility of purchase packages or use of the tool, through payment by users or agents. Also, although we have not configured it for now, it is interesting to integrate with VoIP to take the call from customers or interested parties.","Zendesk for being a tool for customer service would be interesting to link or customize good practice agreements at the service level and operational.We as a client can add response times, and define with a category that is requirements or request and that are incidents.Next, what features Zendesk would need:* Add response time according to the type of requirements or request.* Define type of requests and incidents* Get graphs by type of incidents* Get graphs with crossings between service agreements and operational agreements. This would allow us to measure the effectiveness of the support center based on agreements with customers* Have notifications every time you are consuming the time of a ticket, considering the times of agreements at the service or operational level* Have a video call",5,5,3,4,4,10,1,1,0,-1,1,1,0,0,-1,0
Zendesk,Clean and user friendly!,"ZenDesk really is the best CRM I have ever used, and I was in customer service for 10 years. By far and away the most intuitive, simple and clean user experience you will have for a consumer facing CR interface.","My consumer care team went from using another CRM to ZenDesk and it was like night and day! Cluttered to organized! Overwhelming to clean and easy to navigate! The best feature, in my opinion, is the ability to search for tickets by contact, user or subject and merge those tickets into one. That way you don't have to respond to multiple ticket from the same consumer about the same issue, you can clear those all out at once while creating a better consumer experience (one outbound email). Similarly, the ability to mass select tickets and close at the same time either as Will Not Address (which is a great option) or you can mass select and close using one macro/template. This is particularlyhelpful when your site has experienced a glitch and you've gotten thousands of tickets about the same issue, you can close them all at once when the issue is resolved or if you have an update. Speaking of macros, having an easy place to store your personal templates as well as share the best templates from your team is a game changer. No more keeping templates stored in random docs and then copying/pasting. Overall, I love ZenDesk! It must have been desinged by people who have been in customer facing roles or focused group the pain points for CRMs incredibly well.","I really do love this product. The only thing to mention that could use improvement is the (seemingly) constant outages. There were some days where we would have to wait hours to get back in to the tool. I will say, though, customer support was always on top of it and super responsive.",4,5,4,4,,8,1,0,1,0,1,0,-1,0,1,0
Zendesk,Zendesk Suite manages our technical support,"We use Zendesk to manage our inbound support, account service, helpdesk, and requests from our contact page in order to communicate with users. We collect bug reports and enhancement requests from users and can troubleshoot and monitor requests through various systems we have integrated. It is the foundation on which we base the way we interact with our customers when they come to us.","The API and app frameworks are very useful and serve as a foundation for creating custom apps that can be connected to our Zendesk account for automation and updates, as well as creating specific tools that can be integrated directly into the product while agents are working. This can be very profitable, as there is a consumer sector that allows other services to be embedded in place. Allow us to design goals that are triggered from a variety of data formats from custom recipes, this allows us to have Zendesk update and alert other systems on demand, in real time, avoiding big money scripts that are used for survey automation. The unification is striking due to the number of partner add-ons they offer that are preconfigured to integrate to common tools such as JIRA, Slack, Salesforce, Hubspot, ChurnZero.","We were sheltered by the unlimited light brokers, however, I believe access has been restricted as of this point. They have a tendency to move slowly to incorporate new options into the API, but overall they are quite flexible. In order to understand the API you need to focus on a less important part of their overall platform.",5,5,5,5,5,9,1,-1,-1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

Zendesk,Zendesk for calling only can be difficult,It did the job we needed it to do until we found a better option.,"At first I didn't have so many issues with the software because I thought that's the best we can do, I've been using Zendesk for other features at other jobs and they have a long standing good name.But when I discovered the cost we were paying and the service (or lack thereof) we were getting, I found another option that works much better for us.Zendesk does a decent job at calling, but we often had issues and lost service and when we asked it was always a Twillio issue.Talkdesk also uses Twillio, they all do, and in a year using Talkdesk we haven't had a single outage.I think Zendesk has it's strength in the market, their ticket system and customer helpdesk software is outstanding, just not sure the calling feature is their biggest strength.","It was glitchy, had issues connecting, staff has trouble using it, but mainly it was VERY expensive!",3,3,3,3,1,5,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Zendesk,A Multipurpose Customer Service Management Tool,"Pros:This software allows me to take calls, handle tickets, handle chats and review my internal resources in one place! Different departments have different queues to keep everyone's work separated and with a quick switch of an assignee, you can escalate or deescalate tickets as needed. The software allows the creation of macros/canned responses that can be limited to specific teams but are easily accessible whether it be for a ticket or a chat. The phone call plug in and chat plug ins are easily accessible as well, and can be deactivated for users who should not have access to those features. The chat and phone call notifications are loud and consistent so an agent won't ever miss a service request (unless due to negligence or poor connection). You can customize how many chats an agent should handle at a time and how long an agent can get 'wrap up' time after a call. Tickets are automatically populated after a phone call or chat has been established so an agent can follow up with a customer after they've spoken with them in real time. Other features of Zendesk that I like is it can be used as a help center for FAQs and an onboarding site. So you can use it for job postings to outline the criteria for jobs or gigs and for the application.","Cons:I dislike that this software does not come with its own dark mode feature. All software are integrating that feature into their UI but Zendesk dark mode features can only be accessed through third party developers, some of whom are trying to charge exorbitant amounts per account.",,5,5,,5,,9,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,-1,0

It has so many features that you never stop finding new options to improve the work in the team. It is user friendly and it has a clear interface. You just need to take your time to find and learn how to apply all the features to your everyday taks. I will definitely recommend it!,"It took me a while to get to know more than the basic features in this platform, and once I did I loved it. You can easily create macros, these are templates for emails or replies that you usually send. Using this feature you don't need to write all over again everytime you need to reply the same you can just find it there. You can create a lot of them and name them easily to find them later. You can even use tags to add the name of the user or any detail you may need. The other feature I use the most because we are several people in my team, is the option to assign tickets to other users. This ways you can 'send' a ticket to a colleague for him or her to reply or check it for you. It has SO many options that there is no way to name them all, and they are all super useful! The system can even detect the language of the message and assign it automatically to the member of the team that works with that language!","I am not sure I can say this is a negative thing. But I would like to see more video tutorials on how to use specific features and how they may apply to your team and company.

First off, I'd like to stand out for its user-friendly interface, It's very simple. I would say it's almost intuitive. Which allows you to familiarize yourself with the product right away. Additionally, since we're always trying to provide a first contact resolution, it helps that we can assign tickets to specialized agents and place a higher priority for a faster resolution.","At this moment, I would say the biggest con that happens rarely but can happen if you do not have a potent internet connection: if the ticket is not assigned then very seldom, it will not show the agents working the ticket and both agents can post an internal note in the same ticket.",5,5,5,5,5,10,1,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I'll email you Zendesk support articles. Okay, I've been Googling it and plainly it hasn't helped, which is why I'm requesting assistance from a Zendesk representative. We were advised that if we stated that we needed additional assistance, we would have to pay a large sum of money to have a specialized person assist us.

Both of these things create a more familiar and consistent workflow. Robust: Robust is a buzz-phrase I try and avoid using, but honestly the robustness of Zendesk is one of the primary reasons we transitioned to it away from HelpScout in 2017. Everything is fairly robust; reports, ticket indexing, integrations, customizations, admin tools, inbox monitoring, and so on.Connectedness: Zendesk makes it super easy to have specific teams stay connected with eachother; not just the support team. We can have folks all across our company set up in Zendesk to help with JIRA reports, historical sales information through Salesforce from our Salesforce admins, folks on research teams, EAMs, and so forth.

With such a vast database of industries within their portfolio, ZenDesk has been able to optimize their system, helping businesses across the business spectrum. Have used this software in different industries, and it is responsive to all types of Support communication. Also gives businesses the ability to customize their system, which allows for a great feel/branding opportunity in some cases.","Cons:There are times when the software can be so user-friendly and intuitive that you feel as if you're missing some functionality. While support typically consists of straight-forward communication, there are times when incorporating additional agents in real-time would be helpful in more of a live chat setting as opposed to the email template where most communication takes place. That's not to say collaboration in ZenDesk is impossible as that's not the case at all, but it's not always easy to determine whether another agent is acting upon a support request (can only tell when they are viewing a ticket).",,4,5,5,3,4,,1,0,1,0,0,0,-1,1,0,0

Overall, Zendesk has been a great tool for me and our team.","All good unless few small things like; If an agent forgets to log out of Zendesk, their status remains online, which can be misleading. Additionally, the customer review system is limited, as it only allows customers to rate their experience as either good or bad, without the option to provide additional feedback. This can lead to negative reviews for the company, even if the customer had a positive experience with the agent.

Zendesk,"Good ticketing tool, but not fully a fully customizable solution","This tool has generally met our needs, but may not have been the correct choice for our specific use. If there was an app for end-users and some further customization available, it may be able to become what we had hoped it would be. It does do what it is meant to do very well; it should just be clear that there are limits to its customization.","Web interface and app are easy for agents to use and become familiar with. Forms can be set up and customized to capture a wide range of issues and set up to auto-send to the correct departments for quick follow-up. There is an ability to set up a variety of views and to share these or keep them to a single agent if desired. Once a ticket has been created, end users can reply directly from their email, which makes it simpler for them to use.Analytic tools in Zendesk aren't bad. The permissions and available types of users are good.","There are definitely some limitations to this platform that become more evident the more familiar you become with the system. There are some settings that cannot be customized on a per-form basis, and this makes it difficult to fully customize reporting and analytics properly. There are similar limitations on SLAs, especially when there are end users that operate with different hours/days of week, so some of the blanket settings become less useful in situations like this.There is no end-user app.",4,4,,4,,7,1,1,0,-1,1,0,0,1,-1,0

Zendesk,Beware of shady renewal practices,"Frankly I set this up and rarely used it, all it did was basically get used an email filter for my support email address, I take some blame on never implementing it to its potential but it didn't have the integrations I needed to be truly useful. So I sort of forgot about the account being open.I say a pending charge on my CC and went online and canceled the service immediately, that was Feb 27th.The final change didn't clear my credit card until the the 29th.","Has a decent user interface, handles HTML emails better than most.","Auto-renewed for another year, cancelled immediately, and refused refund.Didn't realize my account was on auto-renew, in fact I thought I had purposely turned that off, but I'm guessing in retrospect, they probably don't even have a way to turn auto renew off even if you want to, I guess you have to request cancellation in writing 30 days in advance, which seems stupid for a SaaS.They also do not provide any advance notice that your account is about to renew and that you will be billed again soon. The moment I saw the charge hit my Credit Card, I cancelled the account and requested a refund, and this was for an expensive annual subscription. They sent a canned response, outlining some hidden line in the huge terms of service that no one reads, that basically says they don't offer refunds for any reason.They obviously don't notify people of upcoming renewals as a way to insure they can get one last pay day out of people that probably don't want to use the service anymore, which just seems like a completely underhanded and evil way of doing business.I work in a space, where I could potentially steer business their way from clients looking for their type of service (even though it wasn't the right fit for me), but no way in hell I will ever recommend them to anyone now, in fact I'll be spending the next few hours leaving negative reviews everywhere that I can and placing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.",1,1,1,1,1,,-1,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0,0,0

Our annual subscription cost over $3,000, whereas what we actually needed was priced at around $900 per year. Although we requested an immediate downgrade and refund of the difference, we missed the renewal date by 2 weeks. Unfortunately, Zendesk rejected our request without making any effort to find a resolution.

When I switched, I had my team reach out to a support email we had connected to Zendesk, which helped me get a grasp to claim ownership and see all of the completed the tasks asked to be done. I saw patterns of requests, so I took more moments to teach others how to fix the problem, if possible to allow more time for other projects.My company also uses this platform for our customer service team. I like to see we can have both IT and customer service on one platform, while also knowing there can be more expansion to other departments in the office space.

Our customers have their own portal for access and I used to be able to create reports, charts and dashboards.","Things come and go in the UI. Most recently they removed what they call support for fiscal years. In reality you cant create any report or dashboard with data that exceeds 180 days. So now all mine are missing data from earlier. Their solution is to export everything to excel and combine it there. Of course I could create reports going back 4 years in 180 day chunks but not much point of not in one place. They have a new user interface that is coming out which actually make navigating the software slower.They removed a the menu header that let you jump around in the software in favor of tiered droplists to move around. One key piece that has always been missing is the ability to put the tickets age into a report, Seems like basic stuff. Also, their customer support typically takes a day to respond of they respond at all.",3,3,2,1,2,1,1,0,-1,0,1,1,-1,-1,1,-1
Zendesk,Life for Support - Zendesk,"Pros:I use Zendesk talk on a daily basis from past 4 years. ZD talk is being used by the company which I am working for and all our other sister concerns as well. ZD Talk has been separated by Brands in the system and we are managing the companies. Calls come in and go out from the Software and it is very rare that we face an issue and mostly it is fixed with a little bit of tweaking in the settings or providing privileges. Our whole software support team and professional services use the product to interact through it and get all personnel updated. I have myself asked many of the IT industry users to opt ZD Talk as it can be used flawlessly with less internet speed as well and it does take much of the internet usage. Overall, I have been very satisfied with the product. The most prominent Pros are I can call and transfer calls as well. Use of call recordings and merging of calls from one to another.",Cons:- The call transfer process needs some steps which should be made easier- A group of users can be made to contact or call in between themselves like an Extension system for all the users in the system- Text to Speech is not yet available- Updating case by 2 users at one time ends in an error.,,5,4,5,4,5,9,1,-1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
Zendesk,Hands down the best support ticket system available,"Zendesk replaced our legacy ticket system, which was clunky and not cloud-based. With Zendesk being in the cloud, we can access customer information, ticket details, etc. from wherever we are. Perhaps most importantly, it permitted customers to give direct feedback as soon as a ticket is marked closed. This has been an invaluable tool for us in evaluating whether we're providing top-notch support.","Zendesk is extremely easy to setup and get started, and once it's up and running, it starts building itself out as a knowledge base. It's extremely easy to search the database, either by ticket #, customer name, application/category, etc. It also produces outstanding reports -- for example,the frequency with which the support staff opens/solves/closes tickets, which customers submit the most/least tickets, etc. In addition, it integrates beautifully with our CRM system (Nutshell) to provide seamless access for sales staff. With this, the sales team can see which customers have open tickets, etc. It's really great! The built-in feedback mechanism is also great, providing customers a chance to review the service received.","It's almost impossible to find something I dislike about Zendesk. I almost never hear any of the support folks complain about it, nor have I run into any problems using it myself.",5,5,5,5,4,9,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
Zendesk,"excellent tool, very useful.","Thanks to Zendesk, now everything is optimized and well organized, we can offer more productive and professional services to our customers.","The tool is easy to learn and does not require special technological skills. It provides a platform to build efficiency and responsibility quickly within a department. This has been an extremely effective tool for managing the high volume of emails that arrive, specifically for AP. Functions such as Views and Reports are excellent tools to control current tickets. The built-in spell checker is, in fact, a lifesave, You can easily track the previous ticket history in case you need to refer to a previous problem, you can combine tickets so you can know what to look for and to focus more on creating an answer, We have the macros configured to mark the tickets as spam, deliver them to another team, etc. I have more time to think about my answers and manage our inflow.","They could benefit greatly from additional email options and customizations, as well as solving some bug problems, since some of the features may be somewhat vague.

Zendesk,Zendesk is a simple and easy to use support ticketing system that can be used by anyone.,"Pros:Zendesk has always been one of the go-to solutions for helpdesk software, but they've really streamlined their system over the last few years. It's simple and easy to use with straightforward options for even those who are new to using a helpdesk system.Zendesk is basically an email support system, where all emails sent will be routed to your Zendesk dashboard and show up as support tickets. Tickets are tagged with its own ID and even cross-referenced to see if a particular sender has submitted any tickets prior, so it's easy to check through the support history. There are also pre-defined responses, allowing for quick and easy replies for typical queries.Of course, these are actually what you might believe every helpdesk system should provide, but you'll be surprised at how much you have to pay and that some don't even have these options at all. Zendesk is actually very affordable and is easily scalable.","Cons:Zendesk is great when it comes to providing the basic needs for most when it comes to a support system. However, additional useful features come at a higher premium, and certain features like chat support is actually not directly integrated into a single dashboard.",,5,5,5,4,5,8,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,-1,-1

Zendesk,Great helpdesk with a couple of downsides,"I would say so soYes, it is a great customer support ticket platform and it allows a lot of customization, however that can be quite overwhelming and requires a lot of reading and digging into things to figure out how stuff works.So it is definitely not as easy to use as others that are just self-explanatory.Now the pricing structure is super super confusing and the most annoying is that they seem to just change the prices and remove features from the plan without notifications.Suddenly our ability to use the FB chat integration was gone and only after countless messages forth and back with Zendesk support they told us that this feature is not available in our plan anymore and that we should upgrade.Zendesk just changed their plan names and now charges double....So within 2 years of using it we should already pay double the price for the same services, does not make sense.",Once the ticket system is set up it is easy to use by customers and agents,They just remove features but the price stays the same or even increases,4,4,3,4,4,7,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,-1,0

Very easy to automate. It's easy for our team to learn. It offers an app store that can increase its functionality","Its customer service team is not good. I find that they have been difficult to contact and difficult to work with. They can take a long time to respond, and will often not help you with much. Their training sessions often have a cost. Zendesk also has a hidden pricing structure. In order to get a feature, you might need to pay for their professional tier, and then add an extra cost for the feature. I quickly found that it was costing too much per user to provide basic features that its competitors offer at no additional cost. Its platform has many layers that do not integrate together. Its chat widget does not integrate well with its ticketing system. Its telephone system is also very segmented.

I understand for the last time why I have not, will not, and do not ever want to entertain using their services EVER again.Seems as if they tout the fact they are 'leading customer service solution provider' but I think they are confusing the services they provide for others vs users needing support from them - because if it was the ladder, it would totally make sense.If their dismally written and executed docs don't help you (they wont) then you can look forward to chatting with their dumb bot, that forces you to go through 5 min of pre-screening before even routing your support request, which once received will only be responded too ever 10 min, and if it's a ticket, expect a response after 6 hours.Not sure how this company stay on top (other than the fact they offer solicited reviews in exchange for more time) but as a social media influencer I will be sure to make sure as many people stay away from this company as they can.",Nothing good can be said about this company.,Everything they offer encapsulates why this company is awful.,1,1,1,1,1,,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

I really like how easy it is to make calls through Zendesk. I use it all the time if I want to find out more information about a customer issue that I have to deal with.

I think it would be better to more clearly order the tickets when I use the search bar - I have no idea what defines the order they appear in, and although it's easy to order by date modified, I'd prefer it to be ordered in that immediately. I'd also like to be able to see my historic tickets more easily. Right now I only seem to be able to see the ones I have in that week, but sometimes I want to find one from two weeks ago or more.

It helps our teams maintain the personalization that our clients need while quickly solving their questions or help requests. The best part? Our customers feel genuinely supported and heard.","Our technical and purchase support teams faced the challenge of increasing support requests as our company grew. No longer was it manageable or logical to respond to customers through a Gmail alias. With the overhead in delegation and our tricky queue needs, we found Zendesk to be the answer to our administrative woes.

With fluid delegation and available API integration, our support teams increased their response and decreased the average time to resolve tickets, all contributing to more satisfied customers and increased, company-wide collaboration.","The greatest challenge was forwarding a message into Zendesk while ensuring that the support personnel remembered to change the sender from the forwarded company address to the customer's address.

Zendesk,Zendesk -Honest review based on experience,"My overall experience with Zendesk Suite as a user for almost 4 years is excellent in email and chat channels. However, it needs upgrades for a better user and customer experience.",What I like the most about Zendesk was the chat feature. It was easy to navigate and the CHAT feature is amazing.,"What I liked the least was merging tickets from phones, emails, and chats. You will get multiple tickets from the same channel from the same customer.

Zendesk,Very Advanced Customer Support Solution,"We're more than happy with Zendesk as our main customer support software. We have a team of 5 - 10 support personnel altogether that mainly work with email and phone support. It logs activities automatically and sends them to our CRM with close to no issues. It's also got good performance and great uptime, and a good number of automation and customization options. Great tool overall","The workflow recipes were a great help for us in the beginning. We knew we wanted to set up workflows for assignment and alerts, but it gave us so many more ideas for what we could automate. We have workflows for automated ticketing, routing, scheduling, etc. These also work as expected almost all the time.","The interface is starting to get a bit old, especially compared to some of the newer support tools",5,4,4,5,4,9,1,1,0,0,-1,1,0,0,1,0

Zendesk,Zendesk Chat (formerly Zopim) works good but ugh,"If you're using it for one single landing page or a very specific purpose, Zendesk chat is great for that. But if you want a chat software that does a lot of different things - like customer support on one page, sales on another, and tech help on another -- it's really hard to do without a developer. At the price we are paying, Zendesk chat is becoming long in the tooth. And we're still waiting on another chat software to change our minds.","It's easy to deploy, and very easy to get up and running. I've gotten my non-tech team to set their own automated messages without having to guide them. Once you're in their dashboard to chat with leads/customers, it's really easy to manage.","Like regular Zendesk's Helpdesk software, the backend UX is so outdated. There's options within options. You can jump around to many different settings to find the one option you were looking for tucked away somewhere else. I also dislike a lot of their conditional logic. It's confusing.I also don't like that if I wanted to have a bunch of different chat types, I'll can't set that up easily without writing custom code to set that up.

It also offers services the complement their main product like their chat box which is very useful to answer quick questions for current and potential customers.","It was a little confusing at first how the ticketing system is separate from the chatbox, it makes sense that they're separate but just trying to figure out how to access the chat from the main panel was a little confusing when I first used it.",5,5,5,5,5,10,1,-1,1,-1,1,1,1,-1,1,1

It supports all the features to assist customers via incoming calls and have channels to reach out your customer in multiple ways.3. Plenty of communication channels -are available in Zendesk. Call, message, email and even communication via social media applications is possible.","I don't think the application possess any negative features, but some additions which I think would be worthwile are keyboard shortcuts.

Zendesk,The first choice when it comes to Helpdesks!,An amazing experience for sure. I started off with this helpdesk and immediately grasped how to use it to my advantage. I was able to check the team's overall performance at a glance using the Reporting feature. We could set up responses for common scenarios which made the agents' life a bit easier and improved output.,"You can customize the views to suit the kind of tickets that come into the account. You can get a detailed representation of each agent's output during the month. You can customize its appearance to best suit your brand and needs. You can set up a variety of pre-conceived responses called macros to aid the agents in responding to common queries and issues within the account. You can set up a call centre using this helpdesk.You can make internal notes to the team using this helpdesk, this is often important during drafting training.

Zendesk,"Great tool, lot's of options.","Pros:I started with Zendesk reluctantly, because I wasn't to thrilled about their design and some features that are a little bit less than obvious, but once you get a hang of it, it's a total life saver.I got a first year free for my startup thanks to go.co - thanks a bunch! And I've been using it ever since. I'm a huge fan of integrating stuff, and once again, I was able to easily integrate Zendesk using their API into my consoles and keep track of what's what and who's who. I know at a quick glance who's responsible for what task and who's doing what. Paired with Asana, this is the perfect work environment.","Cons:UI could be a bit better... at least for the newcomers. Maybe they could consider introducing additional features over time, I'm not really sure what the solution is, but it is a bit overwhelming at the first glance, which may make some users unwilling to try it out.

Zendesk,Zendesk is industry standard for a reason,Overall Zendesk has been great and a good upgrade from what we were using previously.,Zendesk is great because it can connect with many different communication sources although some need 3rd party connection tools.,I wish there were native support for eBay and Amazon messaging.

Zendesk,Zendesk is recommended,Pros:Configuration is pretty easy to set up without a lot of programming to get things working the way you want.,"Cons:Coming from ServiceNow, there was a little learning curve, such as the fine tooth comb experience of modifying whatever I wanted.There's limits to what I can modify in Zendesk.One of the drawbacks is the necessity to add plugins where native features should (at least in my opinion) be available, such as being able to manage users.I have some workarounds, but there is some room for improvement on this end.",Switched From:ServiceNow,5,5,5,4,5,9,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,1,0
Zendesk,"Great set of features that are constantly evolving and improving, sometimes more than you need.","Pros:Zendesk does a great job at constantly improving their product, listening to their customers, and releasing new features to make their customers job's easier and better. From their basic ticketing support, to live chat, talk, and even guides, they really have it all under one roof. They have good tutorials and a pretty active community to get help from if you need it.","Cons:If you want to have something outside their ecosystem, like your own documentation pages for example, it's really hard or impossible to use their features (like their guide) in conjunction with things of your own. Some of the metrics and reporting tools they use are a bit tough to use too. They partner with GoodData for most of their metrics, but they have their own language they use to create these metrics. While there are lots of pre-made options to get many of the metrics you want, creating your own is really tough. You also cannot change how often data refreshes from once a day, so testing your metrics can be really time consuming to ensure you did it correctly.",,5,4,4,5,5,,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,-1,1
Zendesk,"Zendesk is robust and customizable, but....",Mixed bag.We definitely have a love hate relationship with this software.,"Robust reporting, customizable to fit your needs.","To be the largest and most popular support software in the industry, their customer support is TERRIBLE.It takes weeks to get a response, and even then they don't read your email.They send macro responses and give the wrong advice.I've had someone tell me that you can't do one thing or another, when we are clearly already doing it in our setup.",4,3,1,2,4,7,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Zendesk,This product is a huge help in helping us provide excellent support.,"Pros:I love that there is an app, so I can keep up with my support duties even when on the go. I like being able to report on tickets based on the client to see who needs the most support. This helps us know how we might improve our training. Being able to set our own Types is very helpful. Generic types just wouldn't do us much good. You can create macros for those tickets that can be answered with a standard email. Also, we have it set to respond to the client after a certain number of days if the ticket is pending. That prompts the client to reply and keeps us from having to wade through pending tickets manually and email the client. There is a lot more than I can learn about using the product which is also a plus! I have never used the help feature myself, so I cannot really rate that.My coworker has been pleased, though.","Cons:I wish I could set a reminder for tickets that I have claimed,but for which I need to do some more research in order to answer. I'm going to investigate and see if that option already exists and I just haven't found it. I can look trough my tickets but I would really like to set a date/time reminder inside ZenDesk.",,5,4,3,4,4,,1,0,0,0,0,0,-1,1,1,0
Zendesk,Great ticketing platform,Overall experience has been good. Very happy for the product and how it helps us stay organized with the tickets we have coming in.,The ticket tracking system is very easy to use and set up so you can see what tickets each business unit or user has open. It also integrates very well with Slack and Salesforce so users can submit tickets and we can track results in Salesforce.,"Some of the automation is very confusing and certain settings are hard to find because they are buried somewhere. We have automation set up to assign tickets to certain people, but if the ticket needs to get reassigned because it actually relates to another person, it is very difficult to change due to the automation rules automatically reassigning it.",4,3,2,4,4,8,1,-1,1,0,1,1,0,0,-1,0
Zendesk,Premium Support Centre Platform which comes at a cost!,I had a positive expensive working with Zendesk. I set up the support center portals using their customizable templates and found that they worked well for us and our customers. The Zendesk support team were helpful when we needed to contact them too.,The support centre was easy-to-use and had all the features we needed. It allowed our support team to handle all support tickets coming in from customers as well as providing a hosted support website (Help Centre) on a custom subdomain with our HTML and CSS templates to keep it consistent with our brand.,"Overall it was a bit too expensive. It's a great service overall, but there are similar services which don't cost as much which are worth considering.",4,4,4,4,3,6,-1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0
Zendesk,Better Ticketing system,Pros:If you are looking for better and alternate ticket system then Zendesk is the best. You can easily setup Macros and Triggers. Apply tags to tickets which helps you filter out the tickets. You can rout tickets and set automated responses and follow up replies. Zendesk provides you better reporting than other ticketing systems.

Zendesk,Industry standard allows for integrations,Zendesk has been a great help in two specific areas -- solving problems and getting feedback when problems aren't solved (satisfaction surveys). It's been nice to see metrics each month to find out where we can improve.,"The best part I like about Zendesk is the ability to integrate with other software including APIs, the Zendesk marketplace, things like Zapier, and so on. If the solution doesn't exist in Zendesk itself, there's a way to do it. In my personal opinion, I find the software intuitive, but a bit complex at the same time. Until you've gone through it and understand the layout, it might be unfamiliar if you've experienced a different ticketing system.","Creating forms in Zendesk has been really terrible in the past. Trying to arrange them and sort was awful, but they did update that part of it. They continue to get better with features, but some feature updates have been present in the community for years; not that this isn't normal for some software companies, but some of the features seem like they should at least be in a 'beta' stage.",5,4,5,5,5,10,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,-1,0
Zendesk,Support Agents Dream,"Overall, my experience with Zendesk is very pleasant. I can keep track of all issues, questions, tasks and/or discrepancies with ease. Mostly I find myself looking through past tickets as a refresher to how much my company has overcome and the improvements made as a result.","If there has ever been an issue, Question or concern Zendesk was always there to capture it. I set my macros and off I go, responding while having a timer track my time to respond. The feature keeps my staff and clients on track so that they will never miss any inquiry. I have my Zendesk connected to my Gmail for the easiest, fastest way to communicate via email or chat. We have multiple help articles that are available to our clients which saves a lot of time for my agents as this can be a great way to get an answer quickly. Overall my company and I use this software without any hiccups and I can say for a fact I'll be working with Zendesk for all my client's support needs.","What I least liked about this software was how confusing the completion of the tickets are. For example, the open and closed ticket function can be very confusing to deal with, particularly for the client. They often receive correspondence that can be alarming when progressing through different stages of a task. My company usually is able to address this issue quickly but it does become a hassle.",5,5,5,5,5,9,1,0,1,-1,1,0,1,0,0,1
Zendesk,"Steep Learning Curve, but Worth it","I think it provides incredible power for cross-team collaboration within an organization and makes client-facing communication a breeze. Some of the functionality can seem a bit clunky/ non-intuitive when learning the system, but with thorough training and time, these can be overcome.","There are a huge number of integrations and apps that can be added to the software making limitlessly customizable. My organization uses dozens of other programs and services that had available connectivity options with Zendesk prior to our adoption of it, and was a large part of our decision to move to Zendesk. it allows for direct and personal communication with clients while allowing other internal users throughout the organization to review, learn from and share tickets.","Learning was tough and there are a lot of small nuances that take getting used to and can be annoying at first, but once learned are hardly noticeable. Certain functions such as ticket type can be a bit confusing. For example, I am still not 100% sure what, if any, functional difference there is between Question and Task. If there is some way to notify me when a task is due, I have yet to find it after using the software for nearly 2 years.",4,3,,5,,8,1,0,-1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

It has been a very important software for our IT department as they are constantly monitoring the chats and are actively talking with the clients from time to time in regards to their issues. It also helps us to manage client contacts management and also helps us to rely new information about our products directly through email.,You need the paid version to get the best support features which is at a little higher price but the free version is okay.,5,5,5,5,5,9,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,-1,1
Zendesk,Zendesk Review,"Pros:Zendesk is a great platform which gives you different options to reach out to a customer, namely e-mail, chat, and call. You can also see trends or ticket reporting via explore to track ticket requests and how to use it for better ticket management. Finally, what I like most about this platform is the Knowledge Base which can also be made available to public as it helps find answers to certain situations and I love how you can insert visuals/screenshots for a visual person like me!",Cons:The only thing I can think of as what I like least about Zendesk is the recent update that allows you to move the message box to adjust its size.

I manage the articles and receive positive feedback this software helps the team do their job faster and more efficiently. They are able to search for answers in slack and it will link different article choices in Zendesk. It is easy to integrate Zendesk to other services like slack.,"Zendesk has been a great product. I wish you could customize the themes/colors more to match our branding. This would make it more appealing and feel more integrated with our current systems.

I've used other customer service software before and Zendesk was by far the easiest to use and navigate. I also liked how Zendesk had a lot of features that other customer service software didn't have. Overall, I was really pleased with Zendesk and would recommend it to anyone looking for customer service software.","One downside to Zendesk is that it can be difficult to customize to fit your specific needs. While the software is fairly user-friendly, there are not a lot of options for changing the look and feel to match your brand.

Zendesk,Zendesk makes our IT Department look like the heroes we are!,We used to use a free IT support system. Zendesk has dramatically changed how we approach IT support. The set and forget mentality that is Zendesk. We used to deal with disorganization and random people stopping us in the hallway. This would result in us forgetting to address the issue and add further frustration for our end users. Zendesk is so easy to administer and even easier for our end users to put tickets in.,"Zendesk makes it easy for our end users to put in requests for support. We can receive tickets from multiple mediums; email, text, web portal, and app. The mobile app is amazing. Our support technicians are able to respond to tickets from anywhere via the app. Any company who is serious about providing exceptional support needs to be using Zendesk.","There is not much that I do not like about Zendesk.

Zendesk,Best in its Class for Good Reason,"Pros:Zendesk has reached a point of product maturity and mass adoption that few competitors can match. Not only is the software highly refined for its purpose, but millions of customer service reps across the world are already familiar and well-versed with the features within. Some of the biggest companies in the world use Zendesk for millions of tickets and instances per year. As a customer, you've likely used Zendesk many times without even knowing it. Zendesk is a cornerstone for preventing customer churn/attrition, keeping customer sentiment positive, and addressingongoing customer support needs. Given the reasonable licensing fees, I wouldn't use anything else.","Cons:Because it's so popular and common, it's not tailored for any specific industry or product type, so often the features are built in a broad, abstract, and malleable way.

Zendesk,Zendesk increases the productivity of our support team very much,Pros:This is a great customer service tool to effectively address customer concerns.

Zendesk introduced the smart ticket changed the old method of answering to tickets by assigning to people manually based on the priority but Zendesk does prioritizing the tickets automatically. History of the supporting agents and the customers will be updated just every hour and the feedback details can be hidden from the support agent to stay confidential. Integration is possible to almost all the products we use at work.,Cons:They updates the graphical user interface without any notification and the users will not be given an option to stay in the old interface if they do not want the new one.

Other thing is that you can see tickets that are overdue. You can also regroup tickets by choosing OPEN, PENDING, HOLD or SOLVED.We are also enjoying the Liveadvisor feature as well to save and record all our internal processes and guidelines in doing our daily business undertakings.","What I like least in this software is that is kind of pricey but it is worth purchasing though.

I particularly liked the saved reply feature, I could easily select a saved reply, personalize it, and then reply in a timely manner to customers. Additionally, the notification sounds were hilarious, when a new chat came in I'll be alerted in style, I also liked the fact that you could choose from several notification sounds. Zendesk chat kept me on top of my game aiding me to own my skills, even juggling between 5 chats at the same time ensuring that all customers get a timely response and as mentioned above the saved reply feature was a lifesaver.","I realized that Zendesk was a bit slow especially when a lot of persons within the organization were using it at the same time, I would experience lags from time to time even though I had a good internet connection and a powerful Intel i7 machine.

It has all the tools that we need to track the escalations, and solve emails. Since we handle different company, we have the option to filter this information. One of my favorite features is that we can assign emails to specific people. The filtering process it's also nice, because it helps getting the information needed faster. The way we have it setup is that we have different ways to see the companies we work with, the amount of pending emails, and the amount of responses. Having all those reports, help us when informing our coworkers about their progress.",The software is very easy to use. I got the hang of it very quickly. It was also easy when training new employees. The software is very organized. We use for emails and tracking purposes. We have never had issues with the website.

The zendesk business team proved its worth by answering each of the questions we had about the system in record time. It's excellent.

Zendesk,Zendesk - Great for Support Desk but Not so great with functionality,"Pros:Having used Zendesk as an alternative to other options, here are my thoughts on it:1) Zendesk is good at integrating multiple communication channels into one place. Unlike other options, using social media channels is included in the cost. With Zendesk the social media channels are included in the per user cost, so you are only paying for other features like Knowledgebase or Live Chat, or the bundled option.2) Cost per user is fairly reasonable compared to other solutions we looked at. For us the cost per user was really important because while we may need fancy features, we wanted to make sure we did not end up spending more money for features or services we really didn't need. 3) Third party app support - We were able to choose and integrate with third party tools using the App directory. This helps to add functionality that may not be included in the core Zendesk product.","Cons:1) Not sure why but most companies have very poorly designed mobile apps, Zendesk's apps while ok are still not as good as using the web platform. 2) Using social media channels, you are not able to attach documents or media, you can only respond using tech. This would be ok if you do not need to share documents with potential clients but for sales people its not great since we get a lot of our business from social media channels.3) Unread Support tickets -Not sure why this is a thing, but for some reason Zendesk will show every administrator/user support tickets as unread even if someone else is responding to a ticket already.",,4,2,,3,3,5,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,1

Zendesk,Zendesk makes support fun,"I am really happy since using Zendesk. I actually look forward to getting support tickets!I develop & sell software to consumers. I use support techs who work out of their home. It's not always easy bringing them up to speed on some of the more complex technical issues.We used to use straight email. I did not get to see what my employees were telling customers, so I couldn't monitor the quality of service, and give the employees training when required. Now I can see what they are saying, and I can jump in and assist in some of the more complex cases.When I answer support tickets, I am more motivated to give detailed answers, because I can refer my employees to my replies, and they can learn.Now that we all share access to the pool of support tickets, we can give more prompt replies, and customers get faster service. Customers are much more forgiving when they see answers in minutes instead of hours or days. When a customer is thinking of buying and sends us a question, he is more likely to buy if the answer comes back in minutes, and he is still in a buying frame of mind.I love being able to tell at a glance the status of all our outstanding support issues.The Markdown codes enable us to use typographic features to better lay out out replies, making them clearer and more easy to understand.I like the email format that Zendeskuses. It is the most natural and convenient way to communicate with customers. I like that customers don't have to sign into a ticket management app if they don't want to.We tried using a Support Forum so that customers could get access to all past support answers. That did not work out, as some disgruntled customers left nasty and overly negative comments for all to see, which would discourage prospective customers.I am going to tell all my software developer colleagues about Zendesk.Now if you could add Tables to the Markdown code, Zendesk would be beyond perfect.",The Infusionsoft integration is fantastic. One click and I can tell what my customers are contacting us about. (We make a dozen different products. They think we can read their mind:o),Sometimes the Infusionsoft app loses the link.

Zendesk,Good experience using Zendesk,My experience with Zendesk has been good. All our requirements were met.

Zendesk,Get the best customer support software with Zendesk!,"It solved a lot of business problems for our team. We were able to connect our phone lines to Zendesk so every time a customer would call, the system would automatically create a ticket for us. It allowed us to respond very quickly to our customers since we were able to download Zendesk to all of our devices.","What I liked most about Zendesk is the software can be downloaded to multiple devices including a computer, laptop, and iPad. So if you're on the go, don't worry you will still be able to interact with your customers! It is also very easy to use, but learning every functionality of Zendesk could be difficult. Though, they offer online webinars to learn more about how to use it and how to find the data you're looking for.","The one thing that was frustrating about this software is internal notes can be hard if you have multiple users on the email thread. Sometimes you will be trying to talk internally with your team, and some posts would not show up just internally based on who the user was. It did not happen very often but the chance was still there so we had to be very careful.",5,5,,4,,10,1,1,-1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
Zendesk,Affordable and simplistic help desk ticketing system,Helps everyone focus on the work instead of the work order creation process or any other oddities in the work flow that is created by alternative ticketing softwares.,"It was clean and simple and it allowed you to be as complex as you want on the back-end of the system, while only showing as much info to the end-user as desired. If you needed some special integrations or features, Zendesk most likely had something to offer, but the best part about Zendesk is how simple it is because it makes you really focus on the work and not waste time inside the ticketing system itself or doing any other workflows that may be necessary with alternative software options.","Zendesk feature request team did not seem to have much power over what features get implemented and which ones do not.

Zendesk,"Great service desk tool, but lacks some basic functionality","In all, Zendesk is a great platform to service customers, both internal and external. While I have gripes like the above mentioned missing forwarding, I like that the controls are abundant enough to allow for workarounds to be put in place. This level of control has also lead to some really creative efficiencies produced by my team","Zendesk is easy to configure, has a good amount of options, and was very easy to migrate to for my team. I particularly like the level of granularity you can get from the GoodData reporting, and the level of control you can have over your ticket flows through Automations, Triggers, and Macros","Unfortunately, you can find some basic functionality is missing, such as forwarding a ticket to a third-party from within Zendesk. I have had to set up a seperate form with triggers and email channels in order to achieve a bit of a hacky version of forwarding, but it really isn't ideal. Also, the reporting is switching to a paid in-house model (moving away from GoodData) which feels a bit like having to pay for a feature I have always had access to.

Zendesk,Modern customer service portal for the best customer experience,Overall Zendesk delivers a seamless experience for end customers.,"Zendesk has a strong following and the number of customer references made it easy for us to decide to give it a try. My favorite aspect is the amount of customization available to tailor the look and experience of the support portal. It's easy to add FAQs or knowledge bases to make support as self service as possible. The ticket submission system is straightforward to configure. The UI allows for multiple tabs to expedite searches. We also added a JIRA integration that allows us to pass tickets to engineering which works quite well. Additionally, we are making use of the various analytics in order to make sure we are optimizing for the right metrics to continually improve customer satisfaction.","Zendesk starts at $49/agent so it's not cheap. That said, you do get a ton of functionality from the lowest pricing tier. While there is integration with salesforce, it's not as well done as Service Cloud (obviously). For companies who want a single source of truth, you are going to have to sync data back and forth which could become brittle.

Zendesk,Excellent tool to manage live customer quaries,"Zendesk chats allow us to address customer queries while on the website, which allow us to help customer to finalize a purchase that otherwise would be lost. It is also useful to rise customer satisfaction as customers do not have to wait on the telephone or write emails to receive an answer.","My company have used Zendesk Chat to manage the live contact for most of our brands and the experience has been great so far as it is very complete.The chat option allow you to serve customers while they are visiting the website without having to exit the page to do a phone call or write an email. It can be used as an inbound tool to offer customer support or outbound to increase sells. It is possible to personalize the tool according to the needs of your business with the possibility to schedule opening hours, automatic messages,and personalized shortcuts (very useful so your agents won't have to rewrite the same sentence every time). It is also possible to activate an option to reroute your chats automatically to your agents according their skills (languages, expertise etc). Zendesk chat has also a reporting dashboard in which you can see the team/agent performace and in which you can see if an agent is free or busy and how many chats has taken during a certain period of time. You can also subscribe to periodical notifications via email.",The only thing I would suggest to improve is the possibility of download more specific and user friendly reports for agents performances (time online etc) as at the moment they are a too raw to do quick analysis of the agent performances,5,5,4,5,3,10,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,-1,0,1

The FAQ feature has made our work much easier as guides are already provided and only important queries are sent to the support team. This software is user friendly and it provides enough trainingmaterial to get you started on the platform. Overall great job!","Even though Zendesk is an incredible software I believe it would be more helpful to make the customization a little easier to manoeuvre around to increase work flow, so things can become manual if you don't have the time or technical abilities to workaround and fully utilize the platform.",5,5,5,5,5,9,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,-1,0

Zendesk,Great tool to keep all your tickets support in one place with their Support tool,"Pros:This tool works as a great ticket management system. You can link an e-mail address that you set as your support address and any e-mail received will automatically generate a support ticket on it. From there, the support team can either reply straight away or assign the ticket to any other member team that would be able to reply to it.Tickets can be marked in the platform as Open, which is the status that they will automatically have when a new message is received; as Pending, when you post a reply to it or acknowledge it; or as Closed when the ticket is resolved.The platform also provides statistics on how your support team is performing so that you can see reports based on the average first reply time, or the satisfaction rating from users.","Cons:If you're trying to integrate the platform using a form on your website, some of the fields you need might be hard to set up.

Zendesk,Simple Use & Great Tracking,"Pros:Zendesk has allowed our team to manage all communications externally and internally within a single software.With different users and teams setup, you control who sees what tickets and allows us to direct customer's queries to the correct person/team and provide a continuous trail so at any time, somebody can see the history behind a specific inquiry.Personally, I use it for complaint management, which allows me to see the interactions between Sales and the customer, any photos/attachments and provide an internal communication with Sales for any input or analysis.","Cons:Like any software, you have to pay per user, so if you multiple users who use Zendesk in any format, the cost is the same.However, once set-up, it has greatly benefitted us both in customer management but ensuring that nobody is forgotten.",,5,4,,5,,7,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,-1,0,0
Zendesk,Very Robust - May be too much for small businesses,"Overall, this software has been beneficial for us but there may be better, less expensive options out there for small businesses. If you have a medium or large business, Zendesk could bring a lot of value to your business.","This software helps streamline and organize customer communications. Prior to implementing Zendesk, emails would be overlooked, lost, or take too long to respond to. Now we can see exactly what has been handled, what's in process or complete, and what still needs to be reviewed. It's made this process so easy to manage.",The admin side of the software is clunkly and not user friendly. We don't like that features are all separate add-ons (for example chat) instead of all being part of one stream lined software.

They are clearly the leader in the space for ticketing.","We literally could not do anything to get someone to help us with issues we had. Anything from billing, to support request to answering questions was a runaround.

Zendesk,Great chatting software but widget could use some work,"Overall the Zendesk Chat software has helped boost the communication between our business and our customers. We like that we can supply answers right away to people, although it can be a little time consuming if you receive a lot of chats during off-business hours. The history of visitors is helpful though if you miss and chat and still need to get in contact with the customer. I don't know if there are any better chat apps out there, but if not this is a pretty good solution.","This has helped boost our customer service on our website a lot! We frequently get visitors chatting on our website and it helps us keep our email inboxes less crowded, we spend less time on the phones, and we answer customers more quickly. We think the function is a great customer service tool and we would highly recommend adding a chat box to your website to boost communication. The app is also great for answering people right away, and their customer service can be helpful depending on your issue.","As a backend user of ZenDesk chat, it can be fairly annoying when people are chatting you at all hours of the day. Also people can get very impatient if you don't answer them right away. The app definitely helps with that, and you can always put on an away message and get back to people later, but your work hours during the day/evening can definitely stretch out if you decide to answer chats during off-business hours. I also think the widget needs some work. If you're using Shopify, I'd recommend installing the app instead of pasting the widget code in your store theme since it can be difficult to customize there.",5,2,5,4,4,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,1

For example, if a ticket gets submitted with the word Help in the subject line, you can program Zendesk to assign it to a specific person and to reply to the submitter with a message. Automations function in a similar way but are timed instead of instantaneous. Macros allow you to update a ticket's tags, message, and other information with a click of a button. Zendesk has done a great job to make a ticketing system that increases company efficiency. It also has a Help Desk (customer forum / QA) section that is available at a specific price tier that could save you time.","Cons:I really wish that time tracking was available for all pricing levels.

Zendesk,'Zen' captures the effect it has on our support team,Zen in terms of form and function. It will bring peace of mind to both your IT Helpdesk and to your end-users/clients.,"Zendesk is a welcome replacement to our legacy/internally developed Ticketing system. A big push for our IT support team was to (slowly) be ITIL compliant, one step closer to that is our move to Zendesk. Plus the UI is really pleasant to use, zen-like not only for admins but for end-users as well.Zendesk does a good job (at least) for our small business setting. The Helpdesk was put in order with its robust ticketing module, and even our end-users/clients didn't really find it repulsive or difficult when they themselves have to create/update their own tickets. The analytics tool is powerful. It gives us the data to back up our claims for certain recurring issues that we would request management for a budget to resolve.","Price is on the high(er) side compared to its close competitors.The mobile app is not very zen-like if I may say.

Zendesk,The go-to software to manage the support interactions with the clients,Fantastic. I would never use any other tool to keep track of the clients' requests.,"When a software product grows, also its complexity grows. The clients need to be supported in their daily activities and rely on a system that keeps track of their requests. On our side, we need to automate as many tasks as we can so that the answers can be provided always on time. The reporting capabilities are great and we can send periodical data to the most important clients to analyze the progress. The APIs of the tool allow integrations with other software and they are very detailed.","At first, the configuration capabilities and initial setup of the tool seem very complicated and require a lot of time and effort, but it's totally worth it.",5,4,,5,,10,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0
Zendesk,Zendesk Suite is a great option,"I've had a great experience with Zendesk Suite, they have a massive library of documentation and a helpful support team.","Zendesk is incredibly simple to implement on our site for customer support requests.

Easy integration with JIRA and ability to split tickets into multiple ones for tracking purposes. Like the ability it gives customers to track requests they've submitted.",Lacks some reporting capabilities depending on the account you sign up for.

Zendesk,Meets Needs of small business,We use zendesk for customer support ticketing mostly related to support but also for potential sales,I use Zendesk support along with chat for sales and support and I am pretty happy - we have made signed up enough users since we started using Zendesk chat and support to cover any costs- Readers also like the ticketing feature being available as they know that we will get back to them soon instead of an email which they do not even know that we received. Overall its a great program for sales or support at a fair price for small businesses as well.,It is a bit confusing to use and customize- if you make mistakes with triggers it is hard to figure out how to solve it although suppory there is decent- that said I do not blame Zendesk they have many features for more advanced ticketing so its going to be a bit complex because if you are a bigger business or have specific needs you will be utilizing these more robust tools,5,3,4,4,5,9,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,1

You can find most everything you need when helping clients through public reply tickets in an optimal way. At the same time, all communications with the app's UI and APIs are encrypted, so the client can definitely give their full trust-giving information.","Since it's encrypted with too much data, most of the time we're getting caught up with latency, which takes a while to load.

The numerous integrations that exist facilitate the work with the other products that a company has.","The best product to have customer support! It has everything an agent may need and also to inform. We have used several support platforms and this is, by far, the best we have used. It is easy to know the productivity of your team and also help a client.","Since it's from Amazon, there may be downtime. However, they always keep you informed of any problems they may have.

Zendesk,The WORST company EVER,"The WORST company EVER! Because their trial system is so limited I decided to pay for a subscription. COULD NOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME get it up and running properly, then I asked to cancel and have a refund. They continued to ticket my request, then 6mnts later send me a document showing they do no refunds. What a horrible company! I use Agile, a way better system, as is Phoneburner. DO NOT USE ZENDESK","NOT ONE THING, the system is confusing. I used the trial, but it is so limited I decided to purchase a subscription, thinking that every other company I have ever dealt with offers a refund if you see the product is not the right fit.","They ripped me off, they strung me along for 6mnth of back and forth emails... because it's impossible to call them directly! Then I was told they can find no record of me being charged, then they write and say they do no refunds. If I had known that (as it is in such small print) I could have had my credit card reversed, or just not purchased a subscription. VERY bad business",1,1,1,1,1,,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1
Zendesk,Pretty Good CSR Tool,"I use Zendesk when I seasonally work as a CSR for an online company during their periodic launches.I don't have to re-learn it each time, which is nice. I like the ease of finding past tickets. Not a fan of the chat feature.","I like the organization of tickets. It's pretty easy to find a specific one using different criteria. The email reply system is quite good and I like that we can write, store, and use pre-written responses for common questions and concerns.","I do not care much for the Chat function. I felt that it was easy to make mistakes and it was super difficult to find and post pre-written responses for common questions and concerns. When you're on chat with a customer, they want really rapid replies and some of the functionality was just not good enough to supply quick responses.I found myself going back to the Zendesk emails to find pre-written responses for common questions and concerns, copying them from there, and going back to chat to post it into a reply. This was faster than trying to do it all from within chat.",4,4,,4,,7,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,-1
Zendesk,"Feature-rich, but expensive for starters",We used Zendesk to receive (technical) support questions by clients and to follow up on these with multiple colleagues.,"Easy to follow up with clients: they simply send an email to a support email address (up to you to choose) and they would receive an automated response by email and are able to follow up on the email, all in one overview in the Zendesk dashboard.",A full(er) suite is too expensive for what it offers - at least in our case. The downside is for some features that they are integrated/intertwined and would require you to upgrade to the whole suite for example.

A great feature is that you can integrated with the big social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to allow CC to responde quite quickly.,"It can be a struggle for small companies, so I wouldn't recommend it in that case.

Zendesk,ZenDesk is simple and powerful CS software,Pros:It was my pleasure to work with ZenDesk software. I even help them to translate to Bulgarian version. One of the most important thing for customer service software is the ability to searching and finding information for the person you are serving at the time of communication. It is crucial when this communication is over the phone. Thanks to their outstanding UX support agents are capable to find everything related with the person in no time. Integrations with 3rd party apps are essential but not so important. The thing is WHY these apps are paid? WHY? Why I need to move to the upper level of my subscription to use a specific integration. There is no sense.,Cons:The main reason I switch to alternative was the fact that ZenDesk is unable to deliver visual automation process which will help me and my team to scale our support center.,,4,5,5,5,4,6,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,-1,0

Zendesk,One of the better multi-functional products on the market for chat features (and IT ticketing)...,"For ease of use, it definitely provides cross-team functionality that I found pretty easy to understand and share with junior team members. To implement it from home base when I worked for a REIT out to hundreds of marketing teams on our properties... that was a little more difficult to be honest. There was a learning curve for that.","I have been a part of two teams utilizing (home office to consumer-facing) and implementing (for internal team use) Zendesk and overall see many valuable attributes it brings to the table in a market that is pretty saturated with similar tools. For ease of use, I think it tops the chart and is more user friendly than its competitors like the SalesForce comprehensive cloud setup.","Live and integrative chat and messaging features are only as usable as the persons responsible for accessing and keeping up with them are available.

I enjoy all the features and ease of setting up and removing users as well.,Cons:When setting up certain tools or settings it can be a little bit confusing if you are setting up correctly and if it will work like it should.

Zendesk,Great Ticketing System,It has been great. I was looking for a very simple tool to deal with IT issues without having to clog up my Outlook inbox and this has been fantastic.

I love the simplicity of the software and the macros that can be built. I also love that it has an application for my iPhone. I'm able to get a notification on my watch letting me know someone has sent in a ticket so I can deal with it quickly. Also in the future when we add an additional IT person to our company it will be very easy to add them on and assign tickets to them. Zendesk also has great price points. They have expensive plans for people that do a lot with their ticketing system (Zendesk Chat, integrations, etc.) but for someone who is just looking for a simple system I pay less then $10 a month.",Their system which determines how long it takes you to answer tickets on average doesn't have a way to add in business hours and holidays.

Now it's all in one place, total game changer.","End-customer support used to be across multiple channels. From the moment we implemented zendesk, all support was in one place and could be accessed via multiple channels. We even migrated our three main phone lines to route through zendesk talk.

It’s easy to comment internally and easy to view the ticket and receive email updates on where we are at.,"Cons:I may have a limited user role but I wish I could add additional contacts to the email without having to ask IT.

Zendesk,Excellent support portal and ticket management service,Zendesk provided a nice customer support portal for tracking all the customer issues and incidents.,How easy it is to configure and setup the support portal to manage customer tickets. The most important piece is being able to setup the flow to route tickets to the appropriate queue. We also have pagerduty and it's nicely integrated with zendesk such that information can be synched and ticket events can trigger pagerduty actions. We also synchronize information to salesforce so that all incident information can be seen in each customer account. The UI itself is very straightforward using a tabbed approach to simplify management. You can setup addition public facing pages like FAQs or knowledge bases to greater empower customers.,"While there is flexibility to customize the support portal, setting up our licensing system that syncs with Salesforce does require a bit of know-how.

This is a very useful tool for doing analysis on our live channels and as I mentioned, reports has a great function when it comes to filtering.","I really like the feature in Zendesk where we can save our own spiels/scripts that can easily access when doing live chat. But in addition, I really like the logic being used when doing reports as it almost has all the functions/filters needed to generate an accurate report.",What I don't like is some integration to software.

Zendesk,Client Management with Zendesk,Zendesk has helped us improve and measure our parents satisfaction with our communication. It has also helped us stay on course of our response time goal and satisfaction level goal through the statistics it provides daily.,1. The statistics feature that allows us to measure our response time and how satisfied our parents are with our communication. This is is a wow for us because it has basically improved the net promoter score of our organization.2. The software color is friendly (darkgreen)3. It is easy to learn and use.,1.

Zendesk,Use zendesk chat and relax!

But if your service is vast, and requires multiple executives to attend to chat queries, the free version may be limiting. Zendesk is very easy to configure on your application and very intuitive.","Cons:The paid version of the tool is a bit costly so the startups in early stage may not want to use it. Happens very seldom, but there may be minor issues such as the chat window getting hung and responses delayed.

Zendesk,Easy to use and dependable!,Overall experience with Zendeck was positive and I would recommend it!,We used this primarily as an IT ticketing system to open tickets up with the IT consultant who worked at all different hours and times and this allowed us to get the ticket into their hands ASAP and then they knocked it out overnight or during the weekend and we generally lost minimal time.,Not often but some users would get confused and totally miss updates or questions sent back to us from the IT team and therefore we lost time.

We are also able to get insight into article use and track trends in our ticketing needs.","There are some limitations on the types of things that we are able to do, but that might be due to the version of the software we are using. Also, we have had to have some internal web developers help customize the system to get it the way we want. The basic out of the box might work well for some, but we wanted a more branded feel to our help content. One thing that we feel was missing was the option to have a permanent BCC ME address put into a support reps account.

Zendesk,"I was an early adopter, and I was impressed!","Pros:I remember when Zendesk first arrived on the scene, and I was in need of some helpdesk software for a new customer-facing project, so I decided to see what Zendesk was like. I was immediately impressed with how clean the UI was, and how at ease it made me feel when I viewed it as a user, while I was setting up the ticket types and options. I understood pretty much right away why it was called Zendesk. If you want a hassle-free ticketing system, look no further. Uncomplicated issue management at it's best.","Cons:This is another one of those products that I find it almost impossible to fault. In the early days, customer support was quite lacking, but that was about 10 years ago.

Automated email reporting features is a great for management as well.","Cons:Searching isn't precise as times gets truncated after a month, and you can't see when it was made other than months ago. The user interface is a little outdated in that when you have an influx of messages, it can get cluttered.

It also offers a free and demo trial with its basic services.","Cons:The various features are somehow not very easily linked which can affect the ease with which the users can access them.

Zendesk,A tool to manage communication with your clients,"In general, the platform has helped me a lot in managing communication and generating tickets. It would only improve the time of transfer of messages from communication channels to the platform and the breakdown of messages when you have a bot. Outside of that I highly recommend it to have a better control of communication in your community","What I like the most about this tool is that you can connect several communication channels. In my case I have mail, social networks and internal communication. This allows all communication to be centered on one site and thus improve its administration without having to change platforms.","What I like the least is the time it sometimes takes to get the messages from the channels to the platform. There are times that it has taken four hours to go from social networks to the platform.

Zendesk,Good application with everything necessary for proper customer service,"Once you get past the initial learning curve, it's a great app. Since we started using it, we have more control with our clients and all our tickets can be resolved.","The way it allows me to prioritize tickets and assign them to my agents gives me full visibility into the issues and who is solving them.For me it is important to be able to know what problems are the most frequent in the company, as well as to know how my agents interact with clients.",At first it can be confusing to use and the options could be more explanatory.,4,5,5,4,4,9,1,0,0,1,0,0,-1,1,0,0
Zendesk,Keeps customer support issues front and center,Works well for organizing customer requests for a support or development team. Features are very limited in the basic package and upgrading causes the costs to go up dramatically.,Zendesk functions as our central repository for customer requests and issues. Customers have multiple entry points to submit issues and our team has a single interface to work through all outstanding issues.,Useful features for small teams are bundled into more expensive larger packages.

Zendesk,Worth the extra,"Having used Zendesk and a few competitors, I do find value in many of the efficiencies that Zendesk has.

Zendesk,"Zendesk does a few simple things very well, and that is why I recommend it often.","Pros:It's setup is easy and allows you to cover many of the inquiries and questions your customers, have, without creating web pages you have to update.

It also provide accountability to inquiries so you can follow up and have a trail to make sure that the inquiry was addressed, and if not you can fix it.","Cons:There is very little I don't like about Zendesk, except perhaps it's an older software that is mostly text based. So it looks the same on every site, which in a way is a benefit but in a visually driven world, text based solutions can lose people's attention. While I don't think it has to be graphic, by being so text based it is a strength and a weakness, and if you have long answers to your questions, all that small text can look like something the user will skip over.",,4,4,4,4,5,8,1,1,0,0,-1,1,0,0,0,0

Zendesk integrated with our propriety software system (we set that API up) and allowed us to very closely track the concerns and complaints of our customers as well as give us the statistical insights into the quality of our customer support that we really needed.,Cons:Sometimes Zendesk has default features that we weren't aware of and because we used this platform with our customers the use of that platform frequently resulted in customers receiving notifications for things they never should have known about.,,4,3,,4,,7,1,0,1,1,0,0,-1,0,1,0

Zendesk,A useful tool for providing quality support to your customers,"Pros:Zendesk is basically a customer-facing web interface that has been developed to provide robust reporting and advanced analytics to businesses.

You are also offered multi-channel support on e-mail, web, phone, chat, and social media. Salesforce and SugarCRM are pre-built in the software.","Cons:Zendesk has limited functions, including advanced trigger logic, limited use of the CC field, and lack of integration between the chat and ticket reporting features. The reporting is only based off of ticket fields and nothing else.

Zendesk,Zendesk - There are better solutions.,Zendesk is our Customer Service management platform. Would never recommend it as a solution!,"Like the range of apps & integrations they have, this allows users to connect different tools together for tracking & reporting.",Zendesk is a robust & confusing customer service platform. The implementation is difficult & time consuming. Reporting is incredibly difficult to customize. It's too easy to use Zendesk in a silo and it ends up being a real barrier to seeing a full view of customer interactions with your company.

I do like the clean interface.,"Cons:Following a ticket is the only way to be able to follow a specific request and then again if you're working on a 100 tickets a day, it'll get hard to track if the only way to get updates is to follow a ticket.

We were able to sort these issues by urgency and follow up with customers who may not have had a great experience. We received a lot of valuablefeedback via Zendesk.,I like the ability to have any support request ticketed as well as have our support documentation hosted on the same platform. A lot of the new features (2017+) that are available with Zendesk make it well worth thecost for supporting our apps and support documentation. The tickets are easily searchable and I really like the ability to submit as pending if there's an outstanding issue in support. This allows us to provide a better value for our customers since our team is able to see what's pending/outstanding if they need follow up help.,"Initially things were a bit hard to get used to.

Zendesk,Zendesk Suite Review,It is a very good system with little to no alternative. I wish to be able to see competition so that they team at ZD can up their game,The functionality and the variety of reports that can be generated are very important.

You can automatically send out satisfaction surveys to gauge response effectiveness and easily disable the survey when you do not want the customer to receive one.,"Cons:Tickets are not linked by customer/submitter, so it's not possible to see all conversations with a particular customer on one page.

One of the features of this software that I appreciate the most is its user interface, which is not only intuitive and simple to use but also has a visually appealing overall appearance. Another is that it greatly facilitates organization through effective ticket assignment and simple control.","So far I have not experienced any negative aspects, on the contrary, it has simplified tasks that I used to distribute with different software or platforms, which has saved me a lot of time and made my work easier.",5,5,,5,,9,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

Zendesk,I have been using this software for 3 years now and feel it has more advantages over disadvantages,"Pros:Ease of use is first, the customer service can definitely be improved as they prefer more to share article links rather than explaining things.

Zendesk,Zendesk ticketing system is the best,"If you know how to tag anything, you can pick up the whole process within minutes of using it for the first time. You can create contacts at the site of entry, which makes everything faster and easier. Even those who are not software-savvy won't find it a challenge. A plus if you're retro-fitting this process onto an existing business SOP. Zendesk is especially good for teams that work digitally, rather than meeting in a physical space, as it helps keep communication open and easy to access for everyone.","It's easy to understand, easy to use, and doesn't take too much time to use. So many ticketing systems have propriety systems that don't translate to other software. And tagging / editing tickets can take a lot of time. Zendesk is intuitive. I personally like that you can add in-house messages to tickets without sending a million emails, or alerting the client to your communications, and yet it all stays on the SAME ticket. So convenient for keeping all that info in one place.","It's truly very simple. If you don't know how to tag items, or have a tough time figuring out the priority of tickets yourself, it's more challenging.

Zendesk makes collaboration across teams easy which is essential for global groups!",Zendesk is a really helpful tool for managing ticket submissions. Multiple groups can be configured so tickets automatically sort to the correct group (based on conditional logic) so no one has to manually assign tickets to the correct group. Another pro of Zendesk is that it has some reporting capabilities already built in and ready to use. If one of those pre-set reports doesn't fit your needs you can also export raw data to get a more granular view if needed.,My teams struggled a bit with ticket sharing in Zendesk.

Zendesk,Software to keep your customers happy,"The use of the software has improved the customer service time, in addition there are records and reports of the most common failures to improve the strategies.

Zendesk,Why I Chose Zendesk Suite Over Other Customer Engagement Platforms,"Pros:Zendesk Suite is an exceptional solution that offers a unified workspace with a contextual interface.

You can view the complete history and profile of each customer, as well as relevant information from other sources such as CRM, e-commerce, or billing systems. With Zendesk Suite, providing personalized and consistent service to your customers has never been easier, irrespective of how they get in touch with you.","Cons:I find the Bot feature of Zendesk Suite to be one of its weakest points. Specifically, the Answer Bot falls short in its accuracy and usefulness, especially when it comes to handling complex or specific questions. Furthermore, customers can become frustrated with Answer Bot, as they may prefer to speak with a human agent instead of an automated one. I recommend that Zendesk invest in improving Answer Bot's natural language processing and machine learning capabilities, while also giving users more control over its behavior and customizability.",,5,5,5,5,5,10,1,-1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1

Zendesk,I must agree with most reviews here; one of the Best help desk ticketing system,"Pros:Zendesk makes it really easy to organize all requests no just in-house team but outside customers. Not a great fan of cloud base solutions but everyone is jumping on Virtual Servers and Cloud base solutions is like a force movement like me writing this review when Im just evaluating a solution and alternative to G Suites from Google. Workspace from Facebook calls my attention eventhou is also cloud base but is the closes in Features. Just like the Standalone version of Zendesk that we all learn too user the codes and independency of running the software on the local network overpasses any cloud base solution in my opinion. Automations and Macros are great working locally without the need of High bandwith which we can afford in USA but on other locations in the caribean is a luxury even for big business to have the bandwith we have. OOOOhh And what happens at hurricane season? when we had blackouts we still ran the Zendesk locally. An example of such dependency of cloud based systems is the Automations function doesn't flow in a similar way but are timed instead of instantaneous compare to local run version of the software. Macros allow you to update a ticket's tags, message, and other information with a click of a button.

Zendesk,Best marketing department ever!,"Pros:Zendesk has an excellent marketing team who design their advertising, customer engagement campaigns and marketing website. The application itself is pretty good overall, easy to use in it's basic implementation, and fairly straightforward for admins. If it didn't go offline, have glitches, or break, it would be excellent.","Cons:This application is critical to our business but happens to be somewhat unstable, occasionally losing a ticket or two here and there and making for irate customers (I can't blame them). The chat function is frequently unavailable, and the whole site sometimes becomes slow and unresponsive taking hours to receive tickets. The functionality of the site is also unstable on the web portal, where text formatting breaks from time to time, and the html has to be manually fixed. Support for any of these problems has been less than satisfactory for a company that makes a living on claims of outstanding support. None of this is clear until you have used the system for some time, which says a lot for the marketing efforts, but makes it hard to evaluate in a short span of time.

The training curve of Zendesk is so short that it does not take much time for my support experts to learn it. Our support experts are now comfortable in using Zendesk. After using Zendesk now we are able to measure the KPI's of our support experts very easily and we are happy to say that we do not use excel spread sheet to maintain our customer's data. In fact, after the implementation of Zendesk, the next step was the integration of Zendesk with Sales Force - which was successful and helped our support team and Sales team getting connected.

My tickets are always visible, my approvals, etc widgets are very useful too. The portal is light, so it is fast and it also connects seamlessly with Okta.","Employees tend to get confused if the widgets are not correctly set up under the relevant sections of SNOW.

Jira Service Management,Effortless Collaboration and Task Management: A Closer Look at JIRA Service Management,My overall experience with JIRA Service Management has been exceptional.

The platform truly excels in streamlining the incident management process, enabling our team to respond swiftly and effectively to any issues that ariseWith Jira Service Management, we were able to create a centralized incident ticketing system that provided complete visibility into ongoing incidentsThe automation capabilities of Jira Service Management were a game-changer. We were able to set up predefined workflows and triggers, ensuring that incidents were routed to the appropriate teams and escalated as needed","While Jira Service Management offers a plethora of robust features, one area that I felt could benefit from improvement was its reporting capabilities.

Jira Service Management,"JSD has a lot to offer, but requires a lot to learn","JSD offers a lot for any company needing to maintain a service desk to manage thesupport requests it handles from its clients/customers. Because it is a Jira (Atalassian) product, it is most likely utilized along with other Jira tools, and plays quite well with those. Due to this integration aspect, thought, the layers of security necessitated within user settings requires a considerable amount of learning/training, which is not easily attained without paying for it from Atalassian. And, while I understand, respect (and even applaud) the market-oriented principle of this, it does seem a bit intentional that there are no reliable helps available outside of Atlassian (for example, any tutorials you will find on YouTube for assisting with certain user configs, settings, steps, etc. are applicable to much older versions of the software, and to a great extent, are not applicable to the current version). This would not be a negative aspect if Jira did a much better job at keeping their own internal (free) help docs, etc. up to date, so as to apply to the current version, as well.Instead, if one wants highly dependable helps it appears the best way to achieve that is to pay Atlassian for their training courses (at prices that are obviously calibrated toward larger companies/corporations. And blindly undertaking such would seem risky if judged by the extent to which their free user tools are kept up to date.This is not, to my knowledge, the common experience with most apps.","- Lots of tools in one place- Integrates well with other apps (especially other Atlassian products)- UI is clean and user friendly (customizable to a sensible extent)- Contains useful metrics that are easy to configure and gain reports from- Has multiple layers of user settings available for custom configuration to correlate to preferred levels of access among agents, customers, etc.","- Email bounce in frequently fails (bugs?)- Depth of Jira admin user knowledge required for strong mastery of this app; time consuming to acquire a reliable user knowledge (which is necessary to utilize the app with the least bit of efficiency)- Help docs, support mechanism unreliable/outdated (needs to be fresh and current to be applicable to present version of app)- Confusing settings requirements for some user modifications needs (esp. where mapping/editing workflow schemes are concerned)- Completely inadequate amount of general helps/tutorials available outside of Atlassian (YouTube, Google search, etc. for example) which seems a bit suppressed by design.Atlassian offers extensive training, but at a premium cost.- Costly for the overall effectiveness it provides, after factoring these negatives along with the user time required to really learn the application.",4,4,2,4,3,6,1,0,0,0,1,1,-1,1,1,0
Jira Service Management,Highly customizable and integrates well with the Atlassian ecosystem,"Customization, integrations, workflows, SLAs","Newbies to JIRA Service Desk can get a service desk project up and running in less than 30 minutes. If your organization is already using JIRA for issue tracking, then having a help desk with Service Desk is a no brainer. It allows you to integrate software teams and IT teams better within the same ecosystem.The benefit of JIRA Service Desk, when compared with other help desk tools, is the customizability of your workflow. You can set up a workflow to be simple (with Open > In Progress > Closed statuses) or complex (with other statuses like On Hold or Waiting for Customer).SLAs are highly configurable, with the power of JIRA's JQL functionality. So one can conjure up a query to fit their SLA needs. With the addition of custom fields, a Service Desk administrator can create fields to capture important information to streamline the help desk process.Having Confluence also provides more benefits in which you can integrate an existing knowledge base space to a help desk project and self-serve your customers.Finally, being in the Atlassian ecosystem enables you to add additional functionality and enhancements with the use of Apps. There are close to 1500 apps available for JIRA, and many are constantly updated by the app developers.","Administering JIRA Service Desk (and JIRA in general) can be daunting for a new user. With a number of customizations that one can do in a JIRA application, there will come a time where there can be a performance impact on the environment if the application is not governed well.The Customer Portal (customer facing interface) is spartan in terms of customization.

The ability to connect tasks to our regular projects in Jira Software is another winner feature because it saves a lot of time and allows better communication between teams.,"The major downside to Jira Service Desk is customizing it.

Jira Service Management,"Unlike others, doesn't need complex configuration","With the help of Service Desk we get feedback from users about the bugs they find in the product.

I adviced my company to use Service Desk when we were discussing how to receive bugs and ad-hoc requests. We are using this application fro several years and we do not think about changing it.","The only bad point that I can mention about Service Desk is its price.

One way to break down large projects into manageable chunks is to keep everyone in the loop on how things are shaping up.","Jira's flexibility allows for personalization, but more in-depth modifications may call for specialized skillsets.Performance difficulties: Some users may have performance issues, especially when working with larger projects or those that include complicated procedures.",5,4,5,5,5,10,1,0,0,0,0,0,-1,1,1,0

There's no correct way to use it.It's rest API is pretty powerful too and very easy to extend Jira to integrate with 3rd party applications that doesn't have an official Jira integration.",Creating workflows can easily become very confusing and you can easily break how your projects in Jira work if you aren't careful.With every Jira production license you also get a free dev license so that you can set up an isolated dev/staging environment.This is invaluable and highly recommended.The downside is that there is no easy way to migrate any of your changes from dev to production.But there are 3rd party plugins for that.,5,2,5,5,5,10,1,0,0,0,-1,1,0,0,1,1
Jira Service Management,"Efficient service desk for companies small, medium or large","Prior to using Jira Service Desk, were using a combination of Excel and SharePoint with workflows. We couldn't get great reports. It was hard to customize. Workflows broke without a reason because, you know, it's SharePoint. And the entire process of serving customers was dead slow. We brought in Jira Service Desk as a test bed. Within 2 hours, we were testing and customers were putting in tickets. While we used most of the default settings, the value we were generating was way beyond we ever had. Then, we set up SLAs and watch reports for a few days. We were able to see everything we wanted - who reported the issue, when, what was the priority, how many comment exchanges happened, how much time did we spend, did we meet SLAs, what was the solution, etc. Fast forward 2 years. We are now able to create strategies to service internal and external customers better based on the data from Jira. It has helped us go from making gut-feel decisioning to data-centric decisioning. Good data wins debates. Jira helped us with good data.We are also utilizing Jira's excellent searching, dashboarding and API functionality to feed data to other systems and drive changes beyond just customers.","Jira Service Desk was very easy to get started with. You could literally sign up for it and begin using it within an hour. Ticketing system is very customizable and powerful. Customers can be added in bulk and customers can sign up for entering issues. We were able to create different projects (or service queues) so that customers could send requests for IT help, or administrative help, or help with projects. Each such project/queue had different fields. Metrics are all built into the software, so we can know how often Service Level Agreements were breached, who breached them etc. The sheer amount of customizability is a joy. However, without discipline and thoughtfulness, it is very easy to customize it the wrong way.","We feel that the price point could be lower and the speed could be a little faster. Atlassian has made improvements with speed. If a company had 5 people manning different queues and the issue volume is low, the cost would be ~1500/year for those 5 users. So, it would may not be cost effective for a small company that is watching their costs closely. We also felt that a Wiki is not built in. So, if a common solution needs to documented that spans multiple tickets, there's no way to do so. We could buy Confluence from Atlassian for an additional cost.",5,5,3,5,5,10,1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,1,1,0
Jira Service Management,A great option for on-site ICT service desk management,"Overall we are very happy with Jira Service Desk; it has allowed us to provide a higher level of support to users than our previous service desk, and non-profit pricing was very beneficial for us. The software is usable in its default setup but we have found that there is still plenty of customisation that can be done if needed to suit more complex requirements.","I find the UI of Jira Service Desk very clean and modern compared to other service desks software on the market. Included with the service desk is a customisable user-facing portal for users to raise tickets in, which proved very popular with staff when raising tickets alongside traditional email tickets. Due to the way Jira splits service desks into different projects, we were able to create service desks for other departments in the organisation which helped improve productivity and workflow. There are some very useful and well-designed default reports included for ticket statistics (which can be used to keep management happy!). We found the default setup of Jira Service Desk fit our needs very well, but it is very easy to customise ticket workflows and other features to suit more complex needs.","For a service desk technician using Jira Service Desk the back-end UI for managing tickets can be a little overwhelming, however this can be fixed by editing the default workflows for tickets to hide not required information and details. The administration settings are somewhat unintuitively set out for system administrators, but once you get to grips with the layout it becomes easy enough to find what you need from the settings page. We found the instructions on the Atlassian website for setting up an external redirect with a custom URL in IIS a little sparse on detail, but a quick trip to the Atlassian forums cleared up any queries we had with the process.",5,5,,4,,9,1,0,0,0,1,0,-1,1,1,0

The platform provided a comprehensive solution for managing and resolving customer requests and incidents. The ticketing system, along with its customizable workflows, allowed us to streamline our support processes and ensure timely resolution of issues. The integration with other Atlassian products, such as JIRA Software and Confluence, facilitated collaboration between different teams and improved overall productivity. The reporting and analytics capabilities helped us gain insights into our support team's performance and make data-driven decisions. Although there was a learning curve during the initial setup, the benefits of JIRA Service Management in terms of efficiency, collaboration, and customer satisfaction made it a valuable tool for our organization.","One of the aspects I liked most about JIRA Service Management was its robust ticketing system and incident management capabilities. The platform provided a centralized place to track and manage customer requests, incidents, and support tickets. The customizable workflows and automation features allowed for efficient routing and prioritization of tickets, ensuring timely resolution. The integration with JIRA Software also enabled seamless collaboration between development and support teams. Additionally, the reporting and analytics features provided valuable insights into team performance and helped identify areas for improvement.","One aspect I liked least was the initial setup and configuration process. As the platform offers extensive customization options, it required some time and expertise to properly set up and tailor it to our specific needs. The initial learning curve associated with understanding the platform's terminology and features could be a bit steep for new users.

Sometimes I have created one with critical priority, but it seems to be overtaken by some created later with the same priority level.

The user interface has a modern look and feel and is intuitive enough even for a novice user or admin. It has a pretty standard set of tools to run your usual IT Helpdesk and Support roles straight out of the box (Incident management, Problem, Change, SLA management, etc.). In fact, you can set up your helpdesk well within an hour (of course not counting the per company nitty-gritty). Default setup works, but it's also super customizable based on your company needs. The Dashboard has all the at-a-glance metrics, statistics and graphs to keep you up to speed with the overall status.Again, coming from Atlassian, it has a ton of possibilities in terms of integration with other apps. I feel the constant stream of dev improvements and updates.","Even though I mentioned that the third party apps can be easily integrable, we find the documentation for creating one's own integration apps a bit lacking.

This is a project, not something you setup in your afternoon following a lunch break. And with any project, its success is measured in its planning. But learn Service Desk before planning because with the knowledge of what it's truly capable of, you'll be able to build a very powerful service desk solution. My only gripe is that it's not intuitive. We work amongst high level developers who also fumble their way around Service Desk, taking way too long to find what they need. There are workarounds such as bookmarking key screens, but without this approach you easily become lost in the deep levels of available screens and admin areas. Navigation is too complex.",Service Desk's strengths are also its Achilles heel if you don't plan carefully. It's tremendously complex but powerful.,"Configuring Service Desk is by no means a simple feat. This is complex software that requires careful planning. I would strongly suggest you approach Service Desk this way: study the documentation first, write/draw a plan of what you need to achieve and how you need it to look (back and front) and perform. Planning is crucial to avoiding chasing your tail in the days/weeks that follow initial project build.",5,2,,5,,9,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Jira Service Management,An extensive tool for managing IT projects,"Jira is developing great and although it gives a lot of options and its use, at a certain level, requires experience, in my opinion, it is probably the best system I have worked on.",Great configurability. Advanced users can configure jira exactly for their own needs. The system collects and aggregates a lot of data from various sources.,"It takes a lot of time to master the tool.

Jira Service Management,A Great Ticketing System,"Pros:We have just begun using a Jira-based ticketing system to gain support from one of our vendors. So we are users rather than Administrators. However, our experience as users has made us strongly consider Jira for future projects and support implementations.It has a fantastic user interface with a decent amount of features. That said, our vendor did a slow-drip on features for us, and I'm not even convinced that they have enabled all of them yet. But just from what we've experienced, we love the software.","Cons:The slow-drip of features from our vendor (such as seeing who is posting a response) initially made us think that Jira was to blame, but that clearly wasn't the case. I am still uncertain of whether certain features just aren't available or haven't been turned on for us, but I am confident that Jira is a reliable tool for ticketing management.Honestly, the bar is pretty low for ticketing software in my opinion, as I've seen a lot of poor software in this environment. Jira is definitely the best that I have seen so far, and I am hoping it will continue to improve.

Jira Service Management,A no brainier for non profits,In the short time I've been using Jira Service Desk I've been impressed with the scope and capability and think that with the right amount of time invested into getting this setup properly it will do a fantastic job,"I've been trying loads of service desk solutions recently and while i'm still not 100% convinced on which one to settle with, Jira Service Desk is pretty high up on the list.Firstly, they offer a on premise version as well as (the more easy to setup) cloud solution. This is great for those that prefer to host their own solutions.Secondly, this on premise version is also free for non profits which makes Jira Service desk a much more viable solution than some of the other options available.The integration with confluence allows you to build out a deep self service portal, which in theory will reduce tickets. Again, this was easier to setup in the cloud version, but is also free for non profits.It seems to tick all the boxes for an ITIL service desk, which is great.","It is missing some core features which other solutions provide out of the box, most noticeably asset tracking.While this can be accomplished via plugins, it would be nice if it just existed within the core application.",5,4,,4,5,10,1,-1,0,0,1,-1,0,0,0,0

Jira Service Management,one of the ticket holders that I recommend,"My experience has been a test and rehearsal since, as mentioned, sometimes I understood certain things but others became a little difficult to understand and it is not because there is no documentation, there is a lot, but very watered down.but little by little and I have been understanding the things that I need.This has made it easier to serve customers very quickly in their incidents, which in other traditional media would take longer and take time.There is also evidence of the ticket in case the client wants to see the follow-up of her case","What I liked is the intuitive system of being able to provide a client with a ticket of some incidence of their software, in a very easy way for the client to understand, with templates and sending emails, this makes it much easier for clients and fast alert of incoming tickets make this tool very good in its support team, also project management, assigned tasks graphically",What I liked the least is that there is a learning curve a bit long to understand what you need from the tool since the tutorials are good but you can get lost in them with so many things that some contain instead of focusing on what you need,4,3,3,4,4,7,1,1,0,0,1,-1,1,0,0,0
Jira Service Management,So much better than emails!,Good! It’s a clear and helpful way to track work and keep things organized. Way better than trying to deal with support requests through email,The front end UI for customers/users is really straight forward. The integration with active directory has been helpful for user access too,The back end tends to be fragmented for administration. Our site admins all struggle to find settings in illogical places or you have to navigate through multiple different paths to change one thing.

Jira Service Management,Significant improvement over a simple Jira board but complex to set it up,I love the automation part and this makes it much more productive compared to a regular Jira board. So I can only recommend it.,We are mainly using it for customer support and tracking user issues in it. It is a huge improvement over a Jira board because it offers various automations. We can set it up to ping certain user groups on ticket creation or simply do periodic reminders for the assigned people. It is really hard to summarise what can be automated because there are a lot of options.,I think it is power comes from the various custom automations. But this is its drawback too because it can get really complicated to set up what you actually want to achieve.

They have some presets for you to choose from, but only a couple of them were applicable to the way we do business out of the box. I enjoyed that I was able to create workflows to make automation easy/possible. However, I was constantly running into configuration confusion when trying to piece together the parts that make everything work properly; the admin console was often hard to navigate. Licensing was also an issue for us. We were using the cheapest version of the software because there were only two administrators using the software, and the price spike didn't warrant more licensing. However, I wanted to be able to assign users to specific roles within a ticket so they would be able to receive status emails, but they were unable to watch or approve tickets because the console did not recognize them as properly licensed users. To me, licensed users should not need to include managers who may need to watch or approve certain tickets, but Atlassian's structure is not setup this way.",I liked that I was able to build out workflows in order to make managing tickets more automated.,"It was often hard to configure, and licensing makes approval processes very restrictive.",3,3,,3,5,4,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It's nice to have your logo there, but having your colour scheme match up like JIRA and Confluence would also be a nice-to-have.Our issue with our previous methods was that we were still on email. It was difficult to locate tasks and often our email server would break down. JIRA Service Desk solved these issues and allowed us to get clear and concise information from our users.
