Overpass might require you to get to the finishing line in the shortest time possible  but its almost wholly lacking in that S-factor. It sounds perverse  but in order to make suitably rapid progress here you need to slow things to a crawl. If youve ever played a Trials game  youll know that putting the pedal to the metal can be a sure fire way to winding up head-down in a ditch. If anything  Overpass is even more exacting. In this fully-3D racer  going above walking speed into a tricky section is asking for major suspension damage. Thats because youre not racing your buggy or ATV around a series of smooth racing tracks  but rather a bunch of obstacle courses loosely sectioned off by flimsy yellow tape. There are rocks  logs  boulders  and stacked-up tractor tires to negotiate - all whilst keeping within those track boundaries. Youll drive up giant see-saws  and down into the kind of ravines that would signify a major wrong turn in your average rally game. Youre armed against this unique onslaught of physical obstructions with a handful of specialised tools. Your ride is set to four-wheel-drive as standard  but a press of the up arrow will switch to DIF mode  which grants you an insane amount of grip and drive at the expense of steering range. You can also flick to two-wheel drive should the conditions require it. As weve already alluded to  its possible to damage the components of your vehicle  hindering performance and handling. Its a concern that goes well beyond the current race  too. In the games single player campaign mode  any damage sustained carries on through subsequent trials  requiring you to spend valuable money that would otherwise be spent upgrading or replacing your ride on repairing it instead. Overpass demands as much from you as it does its machinery. You cant enter any of its races casually  whether in the single player campaign or multiplayer (online or split-screen). First  you need to carefully scan the horizon to establish the correct approach angle and speed for the next micro-challenge. The wrong sort of momentum heading into a steep climb can mean a humiliating backtrack  or even complete stasis. Then you need to execute your plan to perfection. Too many revs and youll spin your wheels. Place your wheel a foot to the right of where it needs to be  and you might just ground your vehicle. Extra nuance is introduced with the ATV races. Here youre also responsible for the orientation of the rider  using the right stick to lean into turns and climbs. In the right hands it will give you added weight over the key wheels  and more stability when driving at acute angles. In less capable hands  its a serious liability. Given these nuances  the Switchs lack of analogue triggers stands out as a negative. When maintaining the right level of throttle is so much more important than in other racing games  feathering a crude binary input method doesnt feel ideal. Indeed  we never quite felt like we had the full connection to our vehicle that we needed to succeed. [Update: Since this review went live weve discovered that analogue throttle control is in fact available and active by default. We regrettably missed this  probably because it is tied to the left stick  not the right. Called Crawl Throttle  it feels odd and counter-intuitive to feather the throttle with the stick you use to steer  but it is there.] The physics are generally solid but occasionally wonky  sometimes flicking you into unnatural positions. It would be fine for a regular racer  but at the more deliberate pace of this one  with this much focus on precision and second-to-second modifications  the flaws stand out rather more. The graphics are generally a little muddy  and thats not a pun on the off-road setting of the game. Its worth noting that this Switch version appears to be a downscaled port from more capable platforms  and the resulting simplified lighting and textures dont always combine to give you the best visual feedback as to the kind of surface youre driving on. Its all sharp enough in both docked and handheld modes  although theres a general lack of personality and verve to the art style. On a technical front  we experienced some extremely long load times  even when restarting a race. This wasnt true across the board  but it was annoying when it happened on the more sprawling races. Its worth issuing a quick note on the audio  too: the persistent whine of a revving ATV as you wheel spin up a steep incline really drills into your head and cuts through walls. We found ourselves muting the audio at various moments  lest we receive an angry knock from our neighbours.  Theres a stubborn  hard-headed  extremely technical edge to Overpass that will make it tough to love for many. If GRID Autosport is about as serious a racing game as you can manage  then youll more than likely find this games lack of pandering and polish to be downright exasperating. Add in a handful of technical limitations  and only a certain type of bloody-minded racing game aficionado will likely be willing to persist with it. If you fall within that small minority of gamers  however  then the rewards that Overpass can bring will be uncommonly rich. Overpass is an awkward  ornery racing game that stubbornly refuses to indulge your need for speed and instant gratification. It makes you work for every shaved second and clean section  with a unique brand of technical off-road obstacle negotiation that will have casual racing game players tearing their hair out - and a fair few hardened fanatics to boot. Given the lack of analogue triggers on the Joy-Con and even with this hardcore focus in mind  Overpass is simply too rough around the edges to win anything more than a heavily qualified recommendation. But a very specific sort of glutton for automotive punishment will lap it up.  Not Bad 6/10 Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by Bigben Interactive\",\n          \"One of our absolute favourite games from the last console generation  Atlus Catherine is a sublimely stylish mix of visual novel  dating simulation and fiendish block tower puzzler that tells a captivatingly warped story whilst constantly challenging its players with its clever and rewarding platform puzzle elements. Originally released back in 2011  it arrives here on Switch in this upgraded Catherine: Full Body edition which beefs up the base game with a brand new character woven into the story  five new endings  new cutscenes  lighting and texture upgrades  a remix mode  online versus and a safety mode that allows players to sit back and enjoy the story side of things. It is  in short  the ultimate version of a surreal cult classic  and its one that looks and plays absolutely beautifully on Switch. In Catherine: Full Body you assume the role of Vincent Brooks  a terminally stressed out  sweating mess of a systems engineer who  aged 32  has so far managed to avoid any real adult responsibility  spending his days working and his nights drinking with his knuckleheaded pals at the Stray Sheep bar. However time  it seems  is running out for dear Vincent and his bachelor ways as his long-term girlfriend  Katherine  announces shes pregnant and ready to take the next big step in their relationship. Whilst struggling with the notion of fully committing himself to marriage with Katherine and  in turn  the perceived loss of freedom that this represents  Vincent meets the mysterious  free-spirited Catherine (yes  with a C). Catherine seems to embody just about everything he is about to give up; shes spontaneous  breaks the rules and is the polar opposite of his rather serious bride-to-be. Vincent gives in to temptation  they have a steamy one night stand and embark upon an ill-advised affair. As this illicit relationship develops  however  Vincent begins to experience hideous nightmares in which hes forced to climb terrifying death towers composed of huge blocks which he must move around in order to fashion an escape route as horrors from his subconscious attempt to drag him to his doom. Set over the course of nine days  the games narrative sees Vincent begin to lose his grip on reality as the stresses of lying to his pregnant girlfriend  dealing with the increasingly unhinged demands of Catherine and the constant threat of death every time he falls asleep slowly erode his ability to cope. On top of all of this  Full Body adds in a new character  Qatherine \\u2013 or Rin \\u2013 an amnesiac pianist who moves in next door to Vincent and starts to play at the Stray Sheep  slowly becoming entangled in our protagonists complicated web of relationship woes. Rin is a strong addition to the central storyline  even becoming a potential love interest for Vincent if very specific expectations are met  and  by and large  Atlus has done a fantastic job of seamlessly integrating this new story arc into the already existing material. There are somewhere in the region of twenty new cutscenes added to the original story in this souped-up edition  and overall  theyve been patched in without ruining the flow of the delicately-poised plot. Needless to say  between his seriously messed up relationship status  the newly added Rin and constantly looming threat of death via enormous nightmare puzzle demons  Vincent absolutely goes off at the deep end and its the games excellent portrayal of his fantastically sweaty struggle to stay sane  via some excellent writing and voice-acting (particularly on the part of Troy Baker and Laura Bailey) where Catherine: Full Body really takes flight. With Personas Katsura Hashino at the helm  this was always going to be a slick and super-stylish game and the story gains so much from just how well-realised its world and characters are. The Stray Sheep bar \\u2013 where Vincent  Rin  Erica and the rest of the gang hang out \\u2013 is an outstandingly atmospheric little hub where you can drink your lights out  chat to patrons  put some music on the jukebox or hone your skills on Super Rapunzel  the games excellent old-school arcade take on its very own puzzle elements. The banter between Vincent and his clique of buddies is never less than highly entertaining  and it mulls over the games underlying themes in interesting ways; chatting to both your friends and random patrons in this cosy little snug can affect conversations and plot points later in the game  so its always worth taking your time to chug a few rum and cokes  stick a tune or two on the jukebox and get to know the people around you. If we have to pick holes  there are a handful of small issues with some narrative strands leading to rather unsatisfying endings and a couple of scenes that set themselves up to be explosive  trapping Vincent in a tough situation  before fizzling out and letting him off the hook. Overall though  its all just supremely enjoyable stuff; the game is often hilariously funny  always completely engaging and comes with the ability to twist and turn effortlessly between knockabout fun and dark  adult material. To say much more about the story side of things would be to risk ruining some of the fun for newcomers  but what we will say is this really is one of the very best visual novel aspects to a game weve played. What starts out as a pretty stressful but ultimately fairly realistic and relatable situation for Vincent spirals entirely out of control  and by the time youve completed your first playthrough \\u2013 there are at least thirteen different endings here \\u2013 youll really feel as though youve been on one hell of a ride through an absolute fever dream. Of course  as tight as the narrative elements of Catherine: Full Body are  theyd all be for nought if its puzzle aspects werent up to scratch \\u2013 and in this respect the game  once again  nails it. The block-busting action here is top-notch stuff  deeply rewarding and addictive puzzling that manages to strike a perfect balance between being supremely addictive and moreish whilst constantly stressing you out or terrifying you with some abomination plucked from deep within Vincents frazzled subconscious. As you climb through levels youll also meet other men \\u2013 now transformed into talking sheep \\u2013 at a rest area of sorts between towers who are also climbing for their lives  and they share techniques with you on various ways in which you can manipulate blocks in order to get back to reality. Youll learn all about pyramids  sliders  pullbacks  tornados  cut-outs and more  and this enhanced edition allows you to pause at any time and look over all of these techniques  an option that was sadly missing in the original game and is a massive help when you inevitably get stuck at some point or other. As well as this  Catherine: Full Body also now allows you to undo your last move on a puzzle if you mess up; you begin with three undos but can pick up more in the form of pillows as you traverse towers  and this simple tweak really helps the flow of the game  keeping you in the zone and vastly reducing the number of times youll be faced with a frustrating game over screen. The block puzzles may sound pretty simple on paper  and they do start out in a fairly chilled manner  but they soon begin to crank up the tension as different types of blocks \\u2013 cracked ones  springy ones  ice  bomb and black hole ones to name a few \\u2013 are added to the mix  and by the time you reach the games climax  youll be edging your way up seemingly impossible routes while avoiding all of these and fending off attacks from ghastly monstrosities. Of course  you can now also feel free to switch the game to the new safety mode if you dont feel up to the stresses of the puzzle aspect of things here  letting the AI take over with the option to jump back in whenever you feel like it on a climb  or simply skip these elements of the game entirely and stick to the story. Its a brilliant addition and the narrative here is more than strong enough that  even without the challenge of the puzzles  youll still likely find yourself engrossed in Vincents tale. This new edition also doubles the number of puzzle stages available in the game and comes with a new Remix mode which sees things get even more challenging as it adds coloured clusters of blocks which move as one large piece  seriously disrupting the flow of how you go about solving these fiendish courses. As well as Remix  theres also the new online versus option which sees you work with  or pit your wits against  other players in Colosseum or Babel game modes. In Colosseum  youll race to solve puzzles against another player in ranked or casual matches  whereas Babel sees you work either together or against another player in order to climb sets of randomly-arranged towers. Colosseum has actually been really well-received on other platforms where this version of the game was released last year  with its head to head set-up providing fertile ground for intense competitive action. In short  Catherine: Full Body is the definitive  feature-packed version of a cult classic and its also one that runs fantastically well on Nintendos hybrid console. In both handheld and docked modes  we encountered zero bugs or framerate issues and the game itself looks stunning  from its stylish cutscenes to the moody interior of the Stray Sheep and those revamped puzzle tower areas with their reworked lighting and texture elements. We did have some slight niggles with oversensitive controls \\u2013 a criticism which could be pointed at all other versions of the game \\u2013 and you may find yourself struggling on occasion to pull yourself up from an edge or find Vincent inadvertently pushing or pulling on the wrong block  but beyond this small issue  this is pretty much a perfect port of one of our favourite games. Catherine: Full Body is a fantastic revamp of a bonafide cult classic. With an excellent new character and several new endings slickly inserted into an already highly entertaining narrative \\u2013 not to mention a slew of fun new modes \\u2013 this is the definitive version of an outstanding game. If youve never played Catherine before then youre in for an absolute treat  and if you have  wed say theres enough new content here to make it worth diving in all over again.

This is a very original RPG with items that have original names such as \\u201cSuper Potion\\u201d and \\u201cMax Revive\\u201d\\u2026actually  who are we trying to kid? We will compare it to Pok\\u00e9mon  because it basically is Pok\\u00e9mon. Nexomon wears its influences unapologetically on its sleeve. You\\u2019re a kid who becomes a Nexomon tamer (not trainer  that\\u2019s a different word  see?)  you must travel the land going from town to town while catching and training (sorry  taming) more Nexomon  and of course eventually saving the world. It\\u2019s the same idea  same formula  and even has the same battle UI. But looking past all that  can Nexomon possibly use this formula to offer something Game Freak doesn\\u2019t? Well  at first  the story doesn\\u2019t seem to deviate far from its inspirations; you\\u2019re a young kid ready to embark on your Nexomon journey but your trip into the woods to find a Wild Nexomon is quickly halted by the arrival of a violent Dragon Nexomon. The story quickly makes a statement that this won\\u2019t just be your usual Pok\\u00e9mon affair \\u2013 a character that only you can see stops time and offers you one of 9 starter Nexomon. It doesn\\u2019t really matter which one you choose as  unlike Pok\\u00e9mon  these all commonly appear in the wild. It\\u2019s a far less grounded tale than Pok\\u00e9mon usually aims for  but it certainly grabs your attention early on and more importantly it pushes you into your adventure without having to sit through waves of dialogue. Not only did we get our starter Nexomon within the opening minutes  but we were already out in the wild building up our party. This refreshing change of pace is one of the key areas in which the game stands out over its inspiration; not only is the story brisk  but because it\\u2019s a 2D game  you don\\u2019t really have to wait around for anything to load. The transition between overworld and battle is near-instantaneous  battle animations are short and to the point  and even healing your Nexomon at a \\u201cnot Pok\\u00e9mon centre  honest\\u201d is simplified to a quick flash of the screen rather than seeing each Pok\\u00e9 Ball slowly entered one by one. On the surface  it all looks very similar. You can only carry 6 Nexomon at a time  battles revolve around elemental properties  and you encounter wild Nexomon by walking into tall grass. However  there are some nuances to the otherwise identical systems  most importantly how battles work. In Pok\\u00e9mon  there\\u2019s very little to stop you from favouring one monster and relying on the same powerful move to get you through the game  and that\\u2019s the first thing Nexomon tries to remedy. Instead of being able to use each move a select number of times  creatures now have an overall stamina gauge with the more powerful moves depleting the gauge faster. It doesn\\u2019t take long for it to run low  meaning you have to either sacrifice turns to rest or (more ideally) switch out for another Nexomon. On paper  this is a really good twist on Pok\\u00e9mon\\u2019s formula and legitimately goes a long way to giving Nexomon its own identity. It was extremely rare for us to get through a battle without wearing our team down and utilising every single one of them\\u2026 but on the other hand  that can get quite exhausting after one single battle. Nexomon certainly does a lot to speed up areas of Pok\\u00e9mon\\u2019s formula  but battles end up feeling slower than ever. Super Effective moves would be lucky to take off a third of an opponent\\u2019s health and most Tamer battles end with at least a few of your Nexomon falling in combat. Those who have been asking for a more challenging Pok\\u00e9mon outing may welcome this  but it doesn\\u2019t feel particularly respectful of your time \\u2013 we often had to head back to the aforementioned \\u201cnot Pok\\u00e9mon centre\\u201d after only a battle or two. The economy of the game is also far less generous than Pok\\u00e9mon  making it difficult to load up on healing items. There are some great ideas in here  but they just don\\u2019t feel balanced around the surrounding pillars of this design template. We would often end up spending most of our money on Nexomon Traps (a less cosy name for Pok\\u00e9 Balls). These are likewise in rather short supply  which is strange for a game that revolves around collecting over 380 of these monsters. We would occasionally encounter a design we really liked but had no means to catch it  which is as frustrating as it sounds. With such a large roster of Nexomon  there are bound to be a few misses in the design department  but there are still some strikingly brilliant creatures on display here. A couple are a little over-designed  but the creatures that really succeed in this regard wouldn\\u2019t feel out of place in Game Freak\\u2019s own lineup  and you cant get higher praise than that. Theres also some great personality in the writing  such as NPCs freaking out if you enter their house while you\\u2019re still an unknown Tamer. It certainly has a flavour of its own. Routes end up being considerably larger than any Pok\\u00e9mon game  so much so that we actually got lost a few times and ended up travelling to towns we werent supposed to come across until later in the story. You will still occasionally find roadblocks to stop you from going too far  but you\\u2019re mostly free to venture off the beaten path  which is great for the variety in team building. One thing we werent expecting  however  was for a Tamer we defeated a mere 30 minutes ago to be ready for an unavoidable rematch. It\\u2019s a cool idea to revisit random Tamers you\\u2019ve already defeated and see how their team has grown over the course of the game  but the rate at which this triggers can make overworld traversal a tiring chore. It\\u2019s yet another example of a perfectly good twist on the existing formula which is let down by messy execution. Those who were let down by Sword and Shield\\u2019s visual presentation might find more to appreciate here. Nexomon may be a 2D game  but it ends up feeling remarkably expressive and full of life. During battle  every single Nexomon is beautifully animated and the hand-drawn backdrops look absolutely stunning. It brings us back to the days of Pok\\u00e9mon Black & White  which arguably has some of the best art direction in the entire series; it\\u2019s great to see that the torch has been passed on  spiritually at least. Nexomon may be roughly a third of the price of Pok\\u00e9mon  but we were nonetheless disappointed to find that it lacks any multiplayer whatsoever. The added complexity of battles would have translated incredibly well to a competitive setting  but in its current state  all the training you put your party through is strictly used for single-player  which can feel like a bit of a waste. This doesn\\u2019t undermine the core story in any way  but it does leave you with considerably less to do in the post-game  and a lack of incentive to keep building your party beyond catching all the Nexomon. There are a lot of good ideas on show here  but the majority of them are countered by something holding them back. Nexomon: Extinction does enough to make it somewhat distinct  but the unique elements can also be its undoing. It mostly succeeds in being a more deliberate and challenging take on Pok\\u00e9mon  but that difficulty can oftentimes come across as exhausting and artificial. If you felt let down by Sword and Shield there may be aspects of Nexomon you really enjoy  but we cant help but feel that the slow pace of battles and lack of multiplayer features prevent it from being a true rival; its really more like a cheap alternative  but one thats arguably worth a look if youre a hardcore fan of Game Freaks famous franchise.

As it is such a crucial part of the game  we decided not to score this review until we can had sampled the full online experience. Having now done just that  heres our full updated (and scored) review. When Wii Sports came out in 2006 it was nothing short of a revelation; beforehand video games had been all but relegated to buttons  knobs  and sticks as a means of controlling them  but the Nintendo Wii and its titular pack-in sports title bust that idea wide open. You all know the story \\u2014 waggle waggle  tennis racquet moves  mum\\u2019s besotted  dodgy elbow next morning \\u2014 but now Nintendo\\u2019s trying to have another pop at the formula (after Wii Sports Resort and we suppose Wii Sports Club) with Nintendo Switch Sports. It\\u2019s been 16 years  but are we looking at 16 years worth of improvement? Let\\u2019s cut to the chase: there\\u2019s no secret seventh game (although golf is coming soon)  there\\u2019s the six games that are available at the start  and when it comes to local play that\\u2019s your lot. Whereas Wii Sports had the training modes that showed you how to play each sport through a variety of mini challenges  Nintendo Switch Sports just has a brief (and skippable) interactive tutorial that plays when you select a sport  but only for Chambara  Football  and Volleyball. If you\\u2019re in the dark on how to land a specific shot in Tennis  you\\u2019re out of luck. Considering Wii Sports had the previously mentioned training modes for each sport  this is quite disappointing. It can\\u2019t be denied that the sports are simple to pick up and play  but this hinges on your being familiar with the sport it represents from the off. You\\u2019ll also not find a great deal of variety in how you can choose to play each sport. Some do have options and different ways to play which we\\u2019ll detail later on  but many only have a simple selection of three difficulties when playing against a CPU. But let\\u2019s talk about the sports themselves \\u2014 you know  the whole \\u2018game\\u2019 part of the game. Volleyball is a fairly slow affair  unfortunately. The ball moves at a glacial pace to allow players to time their shots more easily which is laudable in its intent  but ends up making the entire game a slog. No options to change how the game plays either  it\\u2019s the first team to five points and that\\u2019s your lot. Badminton is the opposite  a quick-paced one-on-one bout where your accuracy and timing are critical. We had far more fun with this than we were expecting to; even though the concept and execution is simple  its pace and fluidity helped keep us interested. Unfortunately  like Volleyball there\\u2019s no options to adjust how the game plays  and no doubles mode either. Bowling is (as it always has been in Nintendo\\u2019s sport games) an absolute delight. There\\u2019s something so satisfying about seeing the ball roll down the lane and clatter into the pins with that extra bit of spin that you put on the ball by twisting your wrist. Better still  the \\u2018Special\\u2019 mode throws a host of obstacles down your lane semi-randomly  forcing you to completely rethink how you\\u2019re going to get that ball of yours into those cheeky little pins at the back. Football is the most involved sport by far. You have to run around using the left stick (gasp!) and use a variety of angled kicks in order to get that ball into the opponent\\u2019s goal. It\\u2019s a massively simplified and slowed-down affair compared to the real thing when it comes to movement  but it\\u2019s a decently good time only improved by the various options for play. You can do a 1v1  a standard 4v4  practice your little football socks off  or boot directly into the goal in the Penalty Shootout mode. It does feel a little unengaging at times \\u2014 provided you\\u2019re not just chasing after the ball constantly like a five-year-old \\u2014 but it\\u2019s still a decent laugh. Chambara is an odd one  but by no means do we mean that in a bad sense. The premise is simple: attack your opponent to knock them back whilst avoiding their block attempts  and block their attacks to stop yourself being pushed off the edge. It\\u2019s the nuance that makes this all so interesting  though. You have three different weapons to choose from all with their own strengths and weaknesses  but the real fun is in goading and throwing off your opponent mentally. Essentially it\\u2019s poker without the risk of having your real-life legs broken. And lastly we have Tennis. We don\\u2019t really know what to think of Tennis; the concept is fine in theory but the execution feels a bit lifeless. It\\u2019s similar to the Swing Mode in Mario Tennis Aces  except stripped back by several degrees. Nintendo claims that you can use a variety of shots when playing  but despite all our efforts we\\u2019ve only been able to perform forehand hits  backhand hits  and occasionally a lob when we were really trying. You\\u2019re also forced to play doubles in complete contrast to Badminton  which is fine in theory \\u2014 after all  thats how Wii Sports did it \\u2014 but when you\\u2019re controlling the net player as well as the back player it all feels a little forced. Throw in the lack of any major options besides the number of games (with no way to even play a full set) and what you\\u2019re left with is something that just feels a bit limp to us. But whether a sport is good or not  it\\u2019s always heightened by adding additional players. Multiplayer is unsurprisingly the main draw of Nintendo Switch Sports  and even the lacklustre sports were notably more fun with other humans as opposed to playing solo. Yet having said that  even when playing with other people theres a distinct sense of is this it? permeating the entire experience. If you want to play one of the six sports  youre golden. If you want anything to spice it up  youre more than likely going to be left wanting. We know we were. This is reflected in what is clearly being pushed as the main attraction  online play. Playing against others online certainly helps to give more context to the sports on offer and their repetitive nature  much like how an online FPS is arguably the same gameplay repeated ad nauseam. However in the case of Nintendo Switch Sports  theres still just not enough variety to keep things interesting for anything longer than an hour or so. After enough games in an individual sport  you do unlock a basic ranking system in order to pair you up with more appropriately skilled players  but it changes nothing about the actual gameplay. We wont deny for a moment that we had fun when playing against others online (when the lobbies werent dominated by filler CPUs likely as a result of the game not being public in the review phase)  but just like local play we felt that once wed played each sport a few times  wed seen all there was. Even something cosmetic such as multiple arenas for each sport or a token variation in gameplay (beyond Bowlings Special lanes) would help  but as it stands its too much of the same thing repeated over and over again. Customisation is also a mixed affair. You can customise your avatar with a handful of different hairstyles  clothing colours and\\u2026 well if youre playing locally thats about it. You see  the lions share of customisation items and equipment are exclusively unlocked in the online mode through a rotating series of collections  meaning anyone who doesnt have an internet connection or just wants to play with their friends or family locally is stuck with the fairly meagre default lineup. If you happen to unlock all the available items from each collection at one time  youll also be prevented from unlocking anything new until the next collection drops seven days after the most recent. Miis have been sidelined we\\u2019re sure in part to allow more customisation (although you can still play as your Mii if you wish)  but when that customisation is so artificially restricted we can\\u2019t help but have a bit of a sour taste left in our mouths. As far as looks go  its a generally decent effort. Spocco Square is a good-looking setting with lots of environmental details here and there  but it does feel somewhat generic at the same time. Performance is also largely good  holding a solid 60fps in almost all areas of gameplay save a few peculiar instances of slowdown when bowling with more than one player simultaneously. We also grew to like the new avatars more than we expected which was a pleasant (if minor) surprise. Nintendo Switch Sports is a charming but barebones offering. Its not a bad game by any stretch but it lacks an awful lot of what would make for a solid recommendation. Online play is the best option on offer with unlockable customisations and a predictably broader pool of players  but its limited scope means youll be doing the same thing time after time. Local play is hobbled by a lack of any unlockables whatsoever  and with such limited options to change up how each sport plays out  solo play is a slog. There is fun to be had here  but its more in the vein of the occasional 30-minute play sessions with friends than anything with major long-term appeal. If Nintendo supports the game in the future with more sports like the promised Golf  and more options to change up how things play  we could be singing a different tune six months from now. As it stands at launch  Nintendo Switch Sports is little more than just fine.

This Complete Edition bundles in two titles \\u2013 2015\\u2019s Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth  and 2017\\u2019s Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker\\u2019s Memory \\u2013 both originally released on PlayStation 4 and PS Vita. Both are set between Tokyo and a virtual utopia known as EDEN  where players\\u2019 avatars can interact \\u2013 and just like in the real world  some are more salubrious than others. Cyber Sleuth sees players step into the shoes of a half-digital character looking to retrieve their real-world body  while Hacker\\u2019s Memory has you hunting down an identity thief (always use two-factor authentication  folks) in events that run parallel to Cyber Sleuth. Cutscenes are well-animated  but most of the text is dropped on players through written exposition  making it feel more Visual Novel than RPG at times. Despite the name suggesting some fact-finding and detective work  there\\u2019s no real sleuthing to do here. Thankfully  there is plenty of everything else  and between both storylines  you\\u2019re looking at a solid 90-or-so hours of content. We\\u2019d definitely recommend playing Cyber Sleuth first  otherwise it can feel like being thrown into a world where the rules are only gently touched on and never fully explained \\u2013 plus you can import your save across from one game to the other. Plenty of the optional missions in both titles feel a little like filler  but they do add some flavour to the world. The plot is all technobabble in reality  and feels like a very 90s-flavoured depiction of digital life \\u2013 potentially a design choice  but also just as likely to be based on the fact that the anime version of Digimon began way back in 1999. Monsters themselves are framed as computer programs  but offer plenty of personality and varying designs to make trying to find all 340-odd digital beasts includec in the game a compelling chase. While exploring and chatting to various NPCs in the overworld and battling monsters in turn-based combat may sound familiar  both titles here offer enough to distance themselves from those inevitable Pok\\u00e9mon comparisons. For one  monsters here evolve (sorry  \\u201cDigivolve\\u201d) into bigger  more powerful monsters  but they can also \\u201cdevolve\\u201d  offering up more options for further evolutions. It means that there\\u2019s plenty of versatility to be found in the creature-nurturing systems and building out the ultimate team of critters takes some serious hard work and thought. Secondly  battles aren\\u2019t one-on-one affairs  with most contests featuring three-against-three Digimon clashes. This makes having a balanced lineup of Digimon elemental affinities incredibly important  as one wrong move can leave you outnumbered and outgunned. Finally  you don\\u2019t technically catch Digimon by throwing an object at them. Instead  you run into multiple monsters to fill up a meter. Once the meter hits 100%  you create your own version of that Digimon at the DigiLab  while finding more of them out in the wild allows you to create a more powerful instance of that Digimon. This feeds into the game\\u2019s difficulty. On normal and below  it feels too easy \\u2013 with auto-battling able to do much of the heavy lifting. We\\u2019d recommend playing on Hard \\u2013 it\\u2019s not too tough  but there are some boss battles that you\\u2019ll need to grind to be able to beat. Unfortunately  these fights don\\u2019t feel particularly well signposted \\u2013 so there\\u2019s some guesswork involved as to whether you\\u2019ll be ready to take them on or not. These difficulty spikes are fairly common  so if grinding the same opponents to level-up isn\\u2019t something you look for  your mileage will likely suffer. On the plus side  this makes Digimon Story the ideal game to play in portable form \\u2013 grinding up levels on the sofa  the bus  or a train journey. It also helps that while the game isn\\u2019t all that demanding visually  it feels most at home on the Switch\\u2019s portable screen; textures can feel a little stretched on a TV  but the Switch\\u2019s 720p display offers plenty of vibrant colour options. The digital world of EDEN\\u2019s reliance on blue architecture can feel a bit dull after a while (an issue present in both games)  but that\\u2019s a small criticism. Aside from the campaign  there\\u2019s multiplayer battling to be done as well \\u2013 either through local wireless play or online and if nothing else  it\\u2019s a fun chance to compare strategies and lineups with other players. Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition is a content-packed RPG with plenty to see and do. Its evolution system feels wholly unique when compared to another monster-breeding game series you might find on Nintendo hardware  and while the grind may be too much for some  it\\u2019s comfortably one of the best creature-catchers on the Switch \\u2013 although Pok\\u00e9mon still holds the crown  of course.
