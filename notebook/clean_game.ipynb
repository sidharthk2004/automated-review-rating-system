Overpass might require you to get to the finishing line in the shortest time possible  but its almost wholly lacking in that S-factor. It sounds perverse  but in order to make suitably rapid progress here you need to slow things to a crawl. If youve ever played a Trials game  youll know that putting the pedal to the metal can be a sure fire way to winding up head-down in a ditch. If anything  Overpass is even more exacting. In this fully-3D racer  going above walking speed into a tricky section is asking for major suspension damage. Thats because youre not racing your buggy or ATV around a series of smooth racing tracks  but rather a bunch of obstacle courses loosely sectioned off by flimsy yellow tape. There are rocks  logs  boulders  and stacked-up tractor tires to negotiate - all whilst keeping within those track boundaries. Youll drive up giant see-saws  and down into the kind of ravines that would signify a major wrong turn in your average rally game. Youre armed against this unique onslaught of physical obstructions with a handful of specialised tools. Your ride is set to four-wheel-drive as standard  but a press of the up arrow will switch to DIF mode  which grants you an insane amount of grip and drive at the expense of steering range. You can also flick to two-wheel drive should the conditions require it. As weve already alluded to  its possible to damage the components of your vehicle  hindering performance and handling. Its a concern that goes well beyond the current race  too. In the games single player campaign mode  any damage sustained carries on through subsequent trials  requiring you to spend valuable money that would otherwise be spent upgrading or replacing your ride on repairing it instead. Overpass demands as much from you as it does its machinery. You cant enter any of its races casually  whether in the single player campaign or multiplayer (online or split-screen). First  you need to carefully scan the horizon to establish the correct approach angle and speed for the next micro-challenge. The wrong sort of momentum heading into a steep climb can mean a humiliating backtrack  or even complete stasis. Then you need to execute your plan to perfection. Too many revs and youll spin your wheels. Place your wheel a foot to the right of where it needs to be  and you might just ground your vehicle. Extra nuance is introduced with the ATV races. Here youre also responsible for the orientation of the rider  using the right stick to lean into turns and climbs. In the right hands it will give you added weight over the key wheels  and more stability when driving at acute angles. In less capable hands  its a serious liability. Given these nuances  the Switchs lack of analogue triggers stands out as a negative. When maintaining the right level of throttle is so much more important than in other racing games  feathering a crude binary input method doesnt feel ideal. Indeed  we never quite felt like we had the full connection to our vehicle that we needed to succeed. [Update: Since this review went live weve discovered that analogue throttle control is in fact available and active by default. We regrettably missed this  probably because it is tied to the left stick  not the right. Called Crawl Throttle  it feels odd and counter-intuitive to feather the throttle with the stick you use to steer  but it is there.] The physics are generally solid but occasionally wonky  sometimes flicking you into unnatural positions. It would be fine for a regular racer  but at the more deliberate pace of this one  with this much focus on precision and second-to-second modifications  the flaws stand out rather more. The graphics are generally a little muddy  and thats not a pun on the off-road setting of the game. Its worth noting that this Switch version appears to be a downscaled port from more capable platforms  and the resulting simplified lighting and textures dont always combine to give you the best visual feedback as to the kind of surface youre driving on. Its all sharp enough in both docked and handheld modes  although theres a general lack of personality and verve to the art style. On a technical front  we experienced some extremely long load times  even when restarting a race. This wasnt true across the board  but it was annoying when it happened on the more sprawling races. Its worth issuing a quick note on the audio  too: the persistent whine of a revving ATV as you wheel spin up a steep incline really drills into your head and cuts through walls. We found ourselves muting the audio at various moments  lest we receive an angry knock from our neighbours.  Theres a stubborn  hard-headed  extremely technical edge to Overpass that will make it tough to love for many. If GRID Autosport is about as serious a racing game as you can manage  then youll more than likely find this games lack of pandering and polish to be downright exasperating. Add in a handful of technical limitations  and only a certain type of bloody-minded racing game aficionado will likely be willing to persist with it. If you fall within that small minority of gamers  however  then the rewards that Overpass can bring will be uncommonly rich. Overpass is an awkward  ornery racing game that stubbornly refuses to indulge your need for speed and instant gratification. It makes you work for every shaved second and clean section  with a unique brand of technical off-road obstacle negotiation that will have casual racing game players tearing their hair out - and a fair few hardened fanatics to boot. Given the lack of analogue triggers on the Joy-Con and even with this hardcore focus in mind  Overpass is simply too rough around the edges to win anything more than a heavily qualified recommendation. But a very specific sort of glutton for automotive punishment will lap it up.  Not Bad 6/10 Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by Bigben Interactive\",\n          \"One of our absolute favourite games from the last console generation  Atlus Catherine is a sublimely stylish mix of visual novel  dating simulation and fiendish block tower puzzler that tells a captivatingly warped story whilst constantly challenging its players with its clever and rewarding platform puzzle elements. Originally released back in 2011  it arrives here on Switch in this upgraded Catherine: Full Body edition which beefs up the base game with a brand new character woven into the story  five new endings  new cutscenes  lighting and texture upgrades  a remix mode  online versus and a safety mode that allows players to sit back and enjoy the story side of things. It is  in short  the ultimate version of a surreal cult classic  and its one that looks and plays absolutely beautifully on Switch. In Catherine: Full Body you assume the role of Vincent Brooks  a terminally stressed out  sweating mess of a systems engineer who  aged 32  has so far managed to avoid any real adult responsibility  spending his days working and his nights drinking with his knuckleheaded pals at the Stray Sheep bar. However time  it seems  is running out for dear Vincent and his bachelor ways as his long-term girlfriend  Katherine  announces shes pregnant and ready to take the next big step in their relationship. Whilst struggling with the notion of fully committing himself to marriage with Katherine and  in turn  the perceived loss of freedom that this represents  Vincent meets the mysterious  free-spirited Catherine (yes  with a C). Catherine seems to embody just about everything he is about to give up; shes spontaneous  breaks the rules and is the polar opposite of his rather serious bride-to-be. Vincent gives in to temptation  they have a steamy one night stand and embark upon an ill-advised affair. As this illicit relationship develops  however  Vincent begins to experience hideous nightmares in which hes forced to climb terrifying death towers composed of huge blocks which he must move around in order to fashion an escape route as horrors from his subconscious attempt to drag him to his doom. Set over the course of nine days  the games narrative sees Vincent begin to lose his grip on reality as the stresses of lying to his pregnant girlfriend  dealing with the increasingly unhinged demands of Catherine and the constant threat of death every time he falls asleep slowly erode his ability to cope. On top of all of this  Full Body adds in a new character  Qatherine \\u2013 or Rin \\u2013 an amnesiac pianist who moves in next door to Vincent and starts to play at the Stray Sheep  slowly becoming entangled in our protagonists complicated web of relationship woes. Rin is a strong addition to the central storyline  even becoming a potential love interest for Vincent if very specific expectations are met  and  by and large  Atlus has done a fantastic job of seamlessly integrating this new story arc into the already existing material. There are somewhere in the region of twenty new cutscenes added to the original story in this souped-up edition  and overall  theyve been patched in without ruining the flow of the delicately-poised plot. Needless to say  between his seriously messed up relationship status  the newly added Rin and constantly looming threat of death via enormous nightmare puzzle demons  Vincent absolutely goes off at the deep end and its the games excellent portrayal of his fantastically sweaty struggle to stay sane  via some excellent writing and voice-acting (particularly on the part of Troy Baker and Laura Bailey) where Catherine: Full Body really takes flight. With Personas Katsura Hashino at the helm  this was always going to be a slick and super-stylish game and the story gains so much from just how well-realised its world and characters are. The Stray Sheep bar \\u2013 where Vincent  Rin  Erica and the rest of the gang hang out \\u2013 is an outstandingly atmospheric little hub where you can drink your lights out  chat to patrons  put some music on the jukebox or hone your skills on Super Rapunzel  the games excellent old-school arcade take on its very own puzzle elements. The banter between Vincent and his clique of buddies is never less than highly entertaining  and it mulls over the games underlying themes in interesting ways; chatting to both your friends and random patrons in this cosy little snug can affect conversations and plot points later in the game  so its always worth taking your time to chug a few rum and cokes  stick a tune or two on the jukebox and get to know the people around you. If we have to pick holes  there are a handful of small issues with some narrative strands leading to rather unsatisfying endings and a couple of scenes that set themselves up to be explosive  trapping Vincent in a tough situation  before fizzling out and letting him off the hook. Overall though  its all just supremely enjoyable stuff; the game is often hilariously funny  always completely engaging and comes with the ability to twist and turn effortlessly between knockabout fun and dark  adult material. To say much more about the story side of things would be to risk ruining some of the fun for newcomers  but what we will say is this really is one of the very best visual novel aspects to a game weve played. What starts out as a pretty stressful but ultimately fairly realistic and relatable situation for Vincent spirals entirely out of control  and by the time youve completed your first playthrough \\u2013 there are at least thirteen different endings here \\u2013 youll really feel as though youve been on one hell of a ride through an absolute fever dream. Of course  as tight as the narrative elements of Catherine: Full Body are  theyd all be for nought if its puzzle aspects werent up to scratch \\u2013 and in this respect the game  once again  nails it. The block-busting action here is top-notch stuff  deeply rewarding and addictive puzzling that manages to strike a perfect balance between being supremely addictive and moreish whilst constantly stressing you out or terrifying you with some abomination plucked from deep within Vincents frazzled subconscious. As you climb through levels youll also meet other men \\u2013 now transformed into talking sheep \\u2013 at a rest area of sorts between towers who are also climbing for their lives  and they share techniques with you on various ways in which you can manipulate blocks in order to get back to reality. Youll learn all about pyramids  sliders  pullbacks  tornados  cut-outs and more  and this enhanced edition allows you to pause at any time and look over all of these techniques  an option that was sadly missing in the original game and is a massive help when you inevitably get stuck at some point or other. As well as this  Catherine: Full Body also now allows you to undo your last move on a puzzle if you mess up; you begin with three undos but can pick up more in the form of pillows as you traverse towers  and this simple tweak really helps the flow of the game  keeping you in the zone and vastly reducing the number of times youll be faced with a frustrating game over screen. The block puzzles may sound pretty simple on paper  and they do start out in a fairly chilled manner  but they soon begin to crank up the tension as different types of blocks \\u2013 cracked ones  springy ones  ice  bomb and black hole ones to name a few \\u2013 are added to the mix  and by the time you reach the games climax  youll be edging your way up seemingly impossible routes while avoiding all of these and fending off attacks from ghastly monstrosities. Of course  you can now also feel free to switch the game to the new safety mode if you dont feel up to the stresses of the puzzle aspect of things here  letting the AI take over with the option to jump back in whenever you feel like it on a climb  or simply skip these elements of the game entirely and stick to the story. Its a brilliant addition and the narrative here is more than strong enough that  even without the challenge of the puzzles  youll still likely find yourself engrossed in Vincents tale. This new edition also doubles the number of puzzle stages available in the game and comes with a new Remix mode which sees things get even more challenging as it adds coloured clusters of blocks which move as one large piece  seriously disrupting the flow of how you go about solving these fiendish courses. As well as Remix  theres also the new online versus option which sees you work with  or pit your wits against  other players in Colosseum or Babel game modes. In Colosseum  youll race to solve puzzles against another player in ranked or casual matches  whereas Babel sees you work either together or against another player in order to climb sets of randomly-arranged towers. Colosseum has actually been really well-received on other platforms where this version of the game was released last year  with its head to head set-up providing fertile ground for intense competitive action. In short  Catherine: Full Body is the definitive  feature-packed version of a cult classic and its also one that runs fantastically well on Nintendos hybrid console. In both handheld and docked modes  we encountered zero bugs or framerate issues and the game itself looks stunning  from its stylish cutscenes to the moody interior of the Stray Sheep and those revamped puzzle tower areas with their reworked lighting and texture elements. We did have some slight niggles with oversensitive controls \\u2013 a criticism which could be pointed at all other versions of the game \\u2013 and you may find yourself struggling on occasion to pull yourself up from an edge or find Vincent inadvertently pushing or pulling on the wrong block  but beyond this small issue  this is pretty much a perfect port of one of our favourite games. Catherine: Full Body is a fantastic revamp of a bonafide cult classic. With an excellent new character and several new endings slickly inserted into an already highly entertaining narrative \\u2013 not to mention a slew of fun new modes \\u2013 this is the definitive version of an outstanding game. If youve never played Catherine before then youre in for an absolute treat  and if you have  wed say theres enough new content here to make it worth diving in all over again.

A side-on platform-puzzler in the vein of Playdead\\u2019s exceptional Limbo and Inside - with a similarly dark palette - the game casts the player as Six  a nine-year-old girl who must navigate her way from the depths of a titanic ship called The Maw to escape onto the ocean waves. But the more time you spend with Six  guiding her through the clanking and groaning vessel  the more Little Nightmares reveals its shortcomings. Swedish studio Tarsier first revealed Little Nightmares in 2014 as a game called Hunger  and Six is indeed cursed with a raging appetite which sees her take some unexpected character turns. Suffice to say that she is no sweet summer child  at times exhibiting qualities more in keeping with the game\\u2019s array of grotesque antagonists. An empathetic  protective connection with Little Nightmare\\u2019s protagonist is no guarantee  then  which strips the game\\u2019s scenes of life-or-death hide and seek - and desperate sprints to evade the clutches of lanky armed assailants - of the tension they should be positively dripping with. This leads to the player caring less about Six\\u2019s safety than they might\\u2019ve done  had she not been partial to the occasional wicked act. And that  combined with the regular deaths you\\u2019ll encounter (another element borrowed from Playdeads copybook)  turns the trial-and-error gameplay into something where the stakes don\\u2019t feel especially raised. If Six gets fried  or crushed  or caught  that\\u2019s fine - you simply reload the checkpoint  having learned from your mistakes. But here\\u2019s where the greatest obstacle you\\u2019ll face in finishing the game raises its head. Forget the traps and the terrors of the Maw - it\\u2019s the painfully long loading times between deaths that\\u2019ll have you hitting the Switch home button for something less frustrating. If the game snapped you right back to the last checkpoint a few seconds after coming a cropper  Little Nightmares would be much easier to recommend. But with death occurring so regularly - not just because of the things that are actively out to get you  but also some spongey controls  unclear environments and ropey collision detection that sees Six stick herself to walls or stumble on the floorboards when you least need her to - these lengthy waits to get back to the Maw become bothersome in the extreme. Checkpointing itself is fairly generous  with usually only a handful of potential pitfalls between one respawn area and the next  but repeating the same short sequences several times robs them of their potency  and the Maw\\u2019s occupants quickly lose their fear factor. Which is a true shame  as the story of Little Nightmares - fleshed out as it is  wonderfully  by the DLC included in the Switch\\u2019s Complete Edition port - is a treat of gruesome titillation and macabre mystery. It\\u2019s not just Six who isn\\u2019t all she seems; other characters that she encounters - both playable (in the DLC) and not - have murky backgrounds that can be exposed through both their actions and by studying the environments they inhabit. All of those Nomes that run from Six as she sneaks around the ship? Oh  they have their reasons for being afraid of her  and that shocking reveal is Little Nightmare\\u2019s narrative highlight  bar none. Be sure to pay attention to their shadows  too. And you\\u2019ll want to look for those when the Switch is docked  as Little Nightmares is crisp and clear on the TV  its shadows working more as mood setters than making the screen hard to read. Played handheld  though  a game this dimly lit can\\u2019t not suffer from reflection interference  and seeing your own face peering back at you from behind Six\\u2019s misadventures doesn\\u2019t half compromise the experience. If you are intending to play Little Nightmares undocked  then  ensure you\\u2019re someplace dark enough to avoid that. The visuals are a little fuzzier when in handheld mode  but with the stylised look Tarsier has realised here - not to mention the slow gameplay - Little Nightmares doesn\\u2019t suffer significantly for the minor dip in clarity. The DLC  in which you play as another runaway kid entirely  is mechanically identical to the main game  and its three instalments add up to about three hours of bonus material - which is welcomed in a value-for-money capacity  as Six\\u2019s story is beatable in just over four hours  unless those loading screens grind you down first. Oh  and if youve got a Pac-Man amiibo lying about the house  you might want to dig out and dust it off for this one. The DLC features one of the game\\u2019s very best monsters  too  an aquatic nasty that\\u2019s evocative of the truly disturbing  long-haired underwater horrors of Inside. But every time Little Nightmares throws up such a parallel to Playdead\\u2019s output  it only ever comes up short by comparison  leading one to wonder just how much better this could have been with controls that felt more responsive  and quicker turnaround times between failures. Little Nightmares boasts some superb character and environment design  and exceptional sound too  with parts of the Maw screaming as if the ship was a gigantic bionic seafarer. Its story is compellingly told  and the way the main game connects with the DLC is immensely rewarding. But you never really feel like you have full control of Six  and the long breaks between restarts can dump you into a painful loop of spending less time in the game than you do in loading screens. These problems were present in the game\\u2019s initial release back in April 2017  and Switch owners can be forgiven for feeling disappointed that Tarsier wasn\\u2019t able to fix them for this port. If you can overlook them  though  Little Nightmares is an occasionally moreish puzzler with an exceptionally creepy cast capable of turning any stomach.

DOOM is one of the best first-person shooters weve ever played  and is certainly the best in its class on Switch. Theres a certain magical quality about having a game this good on the go. Its brilliant campaign is reason enough to pick it up  but DOOMs multiplayer will keep you coming back for more for months to come.

Theres so much diversity to the size  shape  and moveset of each hero  that it comes at the cost of a more tightly designed set of levels and challenges. Theres a lot of personality to every aspect of its presentation  and the heroes themselves are fantastic fun to mess around with  so its just a shame that it falls a little short overall.\\u00a0If youre looking for something thoroughly silly and dont mind it being a short lived experience  then this is\\u00a0almost\\u00a0gr8  but dont expect much in the way of replayability m8.\",\n          \"Both classic Dragon Quest RPG and Minecraft-style building sim  Dragon Quest Builders takes just enough ingredients from each side of the developmental kitchen and gently stirs them into a dish that never manages to overpower either of its core mechanics.
