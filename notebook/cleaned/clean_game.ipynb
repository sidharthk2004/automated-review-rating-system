A large number of Paper Mario fans believe GameCube title Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is the best game in the series  and have been praying that Paper Mario: The Origami King would finally be the game to match (or even surpass its quality). We\\u2019ll cut to the chase right away. It isn\\u2019t. That doesn\\u2019t mean it isn\\u2019t still an entertaining adventure in its own right  though. Players will just need to reign in their expectations a little and enjoy it for what it is \\u2013 a funny romp through a series of brilliantly designed set-pieces \\u2013 rather than the new RPG experience they may have in mind when thinking of The Thousand-Year Door. As ever  theres a fairly unique plot to kick things off. Mario and Luigi have been invited to an Origami Festival by Princess Peach  but when they turn up they discover that the place is empty. Lets face it  a paper-folding event is no E3 so there was probably always going to be a low turnout anyway  but this isnt just quiet: there isnt a soul to be found. It soon emerges that Peachs Castle has fallen under the control of King Olly  a little regal origami chap whos hell-bent on folding everyone. Indeed  by the time you get there a bunch of characters have already been captured and given the folding treatment  including some Toads  a load of Bowsers minions and even Peach herself. Not content with merely creating his own army of mind-controlled origami freaks  Olly then summons five huge coloured paper streamers and wraps them around Peachs Castle  lifting it high into the air. Its up to Mario (whos left behind on the ground) to figure out how to remove those streamers and get back inside the castle to give this crease-loving crackpot a boot right between the folds. Accompanying you for most of your quest is Olivia  a little origami princess who happens to be King Olly\\u2019s sister. She\\u2019s mortified at what her brother has done and is certain she\\u2019ll be able to talk him out of it once she gets to him  so she joins forces with Mario and they both head out together. The Paper Mario series is no stranger to companion characters  and since they\\u2019re with you all the time in a predominantly plot-based game their personalities are generally a key factor in making or breaking the experience. Thankfully  Olivia is one of the series\\u2019 better companions; she\\u2019s an absolute delight to have around and her cheery  optimistic tone is a constant source of joy. Crucially  her conversations never outstay their welcome and she rarely gets in the way of the action. There\\u2019s nothing worse than a companion who won\\u2019t shut up and this isn\\u2019t really the case here. Outside of cut-scenes she\\u2019s usually fairly quiet \\u2013 only throwing in the odd humorous comment every now and then \\u2013 and she\\u2019ll only ever jump in with advice if you decide you\\u2019re stuck and summon her with the X button. Olivia is far from the only entertaining character in the game  practically everyone you encounter on your travels is comical in some respect. A good example of this is the hundreds of hidden Toads who are dotted around the world. Some of them have been turned into origami and have to be bashed with your hammer to flatten them out again  whereas others are simply hiding (or stuck) in various nooks and crannies and have to be freed. Regardless of the situation  almost all of them will reward you with a funny one-liner that\\u2019ll usually get a chuckle out of you. Naturally  other characters \\u2013 such as bosses or those involved in side-quests \\u2013 have personalities that are a little more fleshed out. From the old tree you encounter near the start of the game who eventually ends up kicking off a large dance routine (don\\u2019t ask) to the hilarious trio of minions you encounter later who are trying to have a canned food party  the level of care and attention that\\u2019s clearly gone into making each of these secondary and tertiary characters appealing in their own right has to be admired. The same can be said for the world you\\u2019ll be exploring this time around. Each of the distinct regions you encounter is brimming with personality and some areas in particular are visually striking  from the autumn-themed second world to the little Vegas-style town hidden deep within a desert (which comes with some truly catchy music  incidentally). To give even more examples would be spoiling things  but rest assured that while there are one or two fairly uninspired sections \\u2013 the underground mine section is mercifully brief \\u2013 for the most part you\\u2019ll get a kick out of the weird and wonderful locations in this one. Don\\u2019t be under the illusion that this is a truly open-world game  though. While early magazine previews seemed to give the impression that we were going to get some sort of Breath of the Wild-style open environment  that isn\\u2019t really the case; the game is clearly divided into separate  distinct areas and you make your way through each one in a linear fashion. They\\u2019re all linked together  and theoretically you could start at the opening Toad Town hub and walk through each of the areas in sequence  so it\\u2019s an open world in that sense of the word. In practice  though  you\\u2019ll work through each area in a standard linear way and will only return to pick up any collectibles you missed. These collectibles come in three main flavours: hidden Toads  Not-Bottomless Holes and trophies. The Toads are mostly there for comic relief  though occasionally one will raise your maximum HP. The holes are liberally scattered around the world and can be filled by chucking confetti at them  and you can collect confetti in a number of ways  including hitting trees or defeating enemies. While a handful of these holes need to be filled to solve puzzles  for the most part they just reward you with coins  which is a bit underwhelming. Finally  the trophies are generally found in treasure chests and can be viewed later in the game\\u2019s museum. You\\u2019re informed when you\\u2019ve got all the Toads  holes and trophies in an area so there\\u2019s an incentive to come back and try to complete the game 100%. There\\u2019s less of an incentive to engage in battles  which will undoubtedly prove to be the most divisive part of the game when it launches. There will be some who think it\\u2019s a breath of fresh air and others who feel it\\u2019s an unnecessary gimmick. We fall into the latter category. Rather than standard turn-based fights  the battleground takes place on a giant turntable split into four separate rings. Enemies are scattered onto the turntable and you can then arrange their position by rotating and sliding the rings. You\\u2019re given a strictly limited number of moves  and you have to use these moves to arrange the enemies so that every one of them is either in a straight line (where you can jump on them with your Boots) or a 2x2 square (where you can hit them all with your Hammer). If you successfully manage to do this  you\\u2019ll get an attack boost and in most situations will be able to take everyone out in one hit. If you can\\u2019t arrange them perfectly \\u2013 or if the strict time limit runs out while you\\u2019re trying to do it \\u2013 you won\\u2019t get your attack boost and will almost certainly not be able to finish them off in that turn  meaning you\\u2019ll have to take some damage before you get to try to rearrange them again. The result is a system that isn\\u2019t really a traditional turn-based battle at all  instead what you have here is basically a puzzle game that essentially boils down to a single premise: solve the ring puzzle in the time given and you\\u2019ll win; fail and you\\u2019ll take damage. The problem with this system is that the \\u2018puzzles\\u2019 generally tend to fall into two different categories: painfully easy ones that provide no real challenge  and annoyingly elaborate ones that even Mensa members would struggle to figure out in the time provided (or even longer  if you decide to spend coins to boost the timer). The result is that you\\u2019re never really satisfied with any of the battles  they\\u2019re either a waste of time if they\\u2019re too easy  or a frustrating exercise in damage control if they\\u2019re too hard. Shortly into the game you unlock the option to activate an assist for battles. This makes red rings appear which show you where each enemy should end up if you solve the puzzle correctly. It doesn\\u2019t solve the puzzle for you \\u2013 you still need to actually figure out how to shuffle everyone around and that\\u2019s still a massive headache during more complex fights \\u2013 but it does lead to fewer frustrating moments where you feel there\\u2019s no possible way you could have figured out the solution in time. There\\u2019s no shame in turning on this assist either  you aren\\u2019t punished for it and  frankly  because it still provides a challenge it should have been the standard set-up in the first place. Occasionally you\\u2019ll encounter other annoyances that result from this battle system. The camera can\\u2019t be rotated  meaning some enemies will be standing with their back to you. During the game\\u2019s middle chapters you regularly face up against Shy Guys and Snifits (the ones who look like Shy Guys but have little cannons for noses)  and you\\u2019ll often encounter both at the same time during battles. Most puzzles are solved by grouping the same types of enemy together  but since Shy Guys and Snifits are practically identical from behind you\\u2019re at a big disadvantage when you can\\u2019t tell which red hooded bad guy you\\u2019re looking at. More frustrating is the inclusion of weapon degradation. Your standard Boots and Hammer are unbreakable and can be used forever  but along the way youll collect a bunch of different variations on each which are needed to ensure you can still defeat enemies with a single hit  or even hurt them at all (you cant jump on a row of spiked enemies without Iron Boots on  for example). The problem is  these weapons wear down and are eventually destroyed  meaning you need to keep finding new ones or returning to the shop in the Toad Town hub and buying more. We dont know what it is with Nintendo and breakable items these days  but if you want to call this game the Breath of the Wild of the Paper Mario series  thats your justification right there. What makes the battles even less appealing is there\\u2019s no real incentive to engage in any of them. There\\u2019s no experience system in this game  so there\\u2019s nothing to grind for. Winning a fight gives you some coins and confetti  and since coins are mostly spent on battle items anyway and confetti literally grows on trees there\\u2019s really no need to fight most of the time. The puzzles make the process so lengthy and convoluted that you\\u2019ll find yourself trying to actively avoid any enemy you see. Besides \\u2013 and this is us letting you in on a little secret \\u2013 there\\u2019s one island you encounter in the game\\u2019s second half where you take part in a seven-wave arena fight and are rewarded with an absolute ton of coins  more than enough to ensure you never worry about having enough coins again. It\\u2019s not all bad news  boss fights turn the system on its head and put the boss in the middle of the turntable with you on the outside of it. Various arrows  attack panels and hazards are placed on the turntable and you have to rotate it to plan out a route for Mario to follow in order to attack the boss. These sections are far more entertaining than the standard battles  you\\u2019ve actually got a chance to figure out a strategy for these ones  the timer is much more lenient and there\\u2019s a wider variety of variables that make things interesting. Normal battles are worth avoiding  but boss battles are worth enjoying. Don\\u2019t let our criticism of the combat put you off checking out The Origami King. Yes  it\\u2019s fair to say that battling is a sizeable portion of the game and while you can avoid many of the enemies you\\u2019re still going to find yourself in plenty of fights throughout  and if you don\\u2019t get along with the mechanics (like we didn\\u2019t) that\\u2019s going to be a bit of a slog. The important thing to note  though  is that everything else that surrounds these battles is an absolute delight. The Paper Mario games are always light-hearted adventures with plenty of jokes and clever paper-based set-pieces but The Origami King is easily one of the funniest and smartest entries in the series. If the thought of the battles puts you off buying it you\\u2019re also going to miss out on some of the most entertaining moments we\\u2019ve seen in a game this generation. There are song and dance numbers  novelty theme parks  a genuinely fantastic stage show section and even the occasional sad or poignant moment to stop you in your tracks and make you feel the feels  as we\\u2019re reliably informed the kids say these days. Paper Mario: The Origami King tries to do something different with its combat system and  to be honest  we arent feeling it. That doesnt mean the rest of the game isnt thoroughly entertaining  however  and while the puzzle-based battles arent quite what a new Paper Mario game needed  they arent so awful that everything else shouldnt be experienced as a result. It still isnt the new Thousand-Year Door fans will have been hoping for  but its still one of the funniest games in the series and its got a truly likeable companion character  and while the combat is far from ideal the fact that we still thoroughly recommend the game regardless speaks volumes about every other aspect of it.

Initially a platform arcade game featuring a squat caveman-boy in a grass skirt  and developed by Westone (then Escape) for Sega  the sequels quickly splintered off into action role-playing territory. Oddly  there are two chronological entries for Wonder Boy III \\u2014 Monster Lair (originally an arcade title)  and The Dragon\\u2019s Trap (originally for the Master System). Compounding the perplexity  the fifth game in the Monster World series is known as Wonder Boy V: Monster World III in Japan  originally released for the Mega Drive. From there  Monster World VI  the sixth entry  was the 16-bit era\\u2019s swan song and wasn\\u2019t followed up until Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom landed on Nintendo Switch in 2018. Confused? Let\\u2019s continue. Hudson Soft licensed the Wonder Boy IP in 1986  but because Westone had already sold the rights to the name and character to Sega  they renamed their version \\u201cAdventure Island\\u201d  retaining the same gameplay structure as the original arcade game  while branching out into a new platform series for the NES  Game Boy  and Super Nintendo. Here  the protagonist was remodelled to resemble famous 80s Hudson Soft executive  Takahashi Meijin. The Wonder Boy Collection  then  handpicks four notable entries in Westone\\u2019s original series: Wonder Boy (arcade)  Wonder Boy in Monster Land (arcade)  Wonder Boy in Monster World (Mega Drive) and the beautiful Monster World IV (Mega Drive). If you\\u2019re buying the Collectors Edition physically via Strictly Limited Games  Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair and the superb Wonder Boy III: The Dragon\\u2019s Trap  are included. Annoyingly  we won\\u2019t be looking at those today. The original arcade Wonder Boy is a fantastic game  and don\\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. You steer Tom-Tom through enemy-filled seas  jungles and caves  until he\\u2019s reunited with his girlfriend Tanya. Inordinately long for an arcade game  a full clear is going to take an hour only if you have it totally mastered. The game\\u2019s genius is in the way fruit appears and its requirement for staying alive  pressuring the player to leap for it while exactingly traversing platform-littered terrain. You can grab skateboards and throwing axes to swat things from afar  and learning to run flat-out while negotiating strings of obstacles is great fun. It\\u2019s precision heavy  tough but fair with tight controls  and deserves its historical dues. And  if nothing else  its theme tune will burn right into your brain and never  ever leave you. For those who dwelled in arcades of the 80s  it\\u2019s pure nostalgic dynamite. Wonder Boy in Monster Land  the sequel  changes the format to a side-on action  role-playing take. Wonder Boy now looks like a cherub in a nappy  but that doesn\\u2019t stop various business outlets trying to sell him beer and cocktails  often in exchange for awful advice like \\u201cI think there\\u2019s a store that sells armour\\u201d. Toddling through stages with your sword and shield and uncovering secrets  you vanquish enemies for cash and then level-up by purchasing items. It was bold for Westone to switch to a role-playing lean back in the world of 1987\\u2019s arcades  but it works. It is a tad dated now \\u2014 arguably more so than its predecessor \\u2014 but beneath its visual simplicity is a well-thought-out title. Wonder Boy in Monster World was the first bespoke entry for the Mega Drive  and it\\u2019s a beauty. As well as being visually attractive  with gorgeous dithered painted backdrops  it\\u2019s also a plucky  upbeat adventure with transitory role-playing elements. Big bosses  plenty of locations  and a nice sense of journey are only marginally dented by some rather abstruse objectives right at the end  where it all gets slightly sci-fi. On the whole  though  Monster World is a charming game that will offer first-timers three to four hours of sword-swatting  protagonist-bolstering action. While it\\u2019s showing its age a little in terms of depth  it remains a deserved highlight of Westone\\u2019s series. Monster World IV  the final entry in the collection  is the jewel in the crown. Extortionately expensive on the Mega Drive\\u2019s after-market owing to its Japan-only release  it also appeared fully translated on the Wii Virtual Console. Doing away with the male lead  Westone got creative here  transposing the traditional fantasy world of demons and dragons for an Arabian-inspired fictional universe. Here  Asha  a green-haired girl with a world to save  moves with speed and purpose  hopping  leaping and slashing through beautifully rendered landscapes  glowing with colour  movement and character. The dungeons and accompanying puzzles are compelling thanks to the clever implementation of her pet  a small blue beast known as \\u2018Pepelogoo\\u2019 who helps her overcome obstacles and bridge gaps with ever-evolving attributes. While it follows the basic structure of its action role-playing predecessors  there\\u2019s a level of pastel-shaded charisma that goes beyond what came before. Its music  glorious aesthetic  giant bosses  and the exacting design of its stages make it a joy to play. None of what\\u2019s on offer in the Wonder Boy Collection is lacking in quality  although the appeal of the games will vary based on taste. While the original Wonder Boy is a classic all its own  the other three titles are more directly related  and there\\u2019s an arc in terms of accessibility and enjoyability. That\\u2019s not to detract from any individual game: all are good enough to work through  and those experiencing them for the first time will have a blast. The onus here is less on the titles themselves  and more on the package\\u2019s presentation. The menus are colourful and serviceable  each game displayed on a placard with a paragraph of historical information. From what we can glean  emulation accuracy seems spot on  running smoothly  and at the correct speeds. You can save-state at any point  meaning you can drop in and out freely  and if you\\u2019re an absolute cheating git  you can rewind the action using the shoulder buttons to bring yourself back from death in the blink of an eye. The display options are thorough  allowing a variety of adjustments and image tweaks  with ratio settings for scanlines  sharpness  screen curvature and shadow masks  all with a useful preview option via the ZR button. However  different games react differently to these settings. With the CRT filter applied  the original arcade Wonder Boy displays sharp even on a 55\\u201d screen. The Mega Drive titles  however  seem to apply bilinear smoothing the moment the filter is switched on  and no amount of tweaking is able to get rid of it. Even with scanlines and the mask filter set to zero  it remains slightly blurry until totally deactivated. What irks  really  isn\\u2019t what\\u2019s in the package  but what isn\\u2019t. The Dragon\\u2019s Trap  in particular  is one of the best titles Westone produced  and superior to Wonder Boy II. Restricting it to a purposely finite Strictly Limited Games physical release leaves a bad taste in the mouth. These are games dating back almost 40 years  and chances are you either own them already or have played them to death across various platforms or emulators. It\\u2019s totally feasible on current-gen hardware to include every Wonder Boy title  on every platform  with every region variation  rather than limiting the standard production to a nicely curated but somewhat meagre selection of four. Scoring the Wonder Boy Collection is only partly related to the quality of the games on offer. They\\u2019re all excellent for what they are  and were they appraised independently  would do very well. But this is more about the package as a whole. Yes  there\\u2019s plenty here to keep you occupied  but at the same time  what could have been is a sticking point. Wonder Boy is a great little series  with games spanning everything from the Master System to the PC Engine  in various guises. It\\u2019s not difficult to offer a more extensive library for the broader gaming populace  rather than restrict certain titles to a group profiled for their magpie eyes.
